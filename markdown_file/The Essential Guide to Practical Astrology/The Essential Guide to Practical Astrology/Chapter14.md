# Chapter 14
## Your Generational Circle: Uranus, Neptune, Pluto

Uranus, planet of revolution, rebellion, and innovation
Neptune, planet of spirituality, enlightenment, and compassion
Pluto, planet of mortality, empowerment, and transcendence

Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are called generational planets because they move so slowly that entire generations are born with these planets in the same sign. These planets tell us about the cultural touchstones (Pearl Harbor, poodle skirts, Woodstock, savings bonds with an annual yield of more than 1 percent) that you share with most everyone born around the same time that you were.

The generational planets symbolize spiritual and psychological processes that take time to play out, and that describe the "zeitgeist" of a particular moment in history. Think of it this way: plant summer squash and you'll see fruit within a month; plant an oak tree and it could be many years before your kids get their tree house. The faster-moving "personal" planets—the Sun, Moon, Mercury, and Venus—are summer squash. The slower-moving planets, especially Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, are trees.

You're a member of a generation—perhaps a post-World War II baby boomer with self-obsessed Pluto in Leo (1940-1957) and a dusty collection of Rolling Stones LPs, or a Generation X "slacker" with Pluto in Libra (1971-1984) and an anatomical portfolio of tattoos. But you also experienced your generation's defining issues on a personal level; that experience is symbolized by the placement of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto in the houses of your chart.

# Your Inner Revolutionary: Uranus

Whenever you see news footage of people rioting in the streets, marching for causes, or engaging civil disobedience, you're watching Uranus in action. It's the planet of revolution, tearing down structures that stifle individual expression, and generally sticking it to "The Man." Even its physical orientation (it rotates sideways) and its name (there are at least three common pronunciations, at least one of which is certain to elicit giggles) bear mute testimony to its overall weirdness.

And that's what Uranus represents: weirdness. Being different from everyone else, and rebelling against the status quo. The way your generation rebelled against the one that came before, and was viewed askance by your parents ("Those kids with their crazy haircuts/loud music/piercings and tattoos"). And the ways you, personally, feel that you don't fit in and are inclined to a certain twitchy rebelliousness.

Uranus is symbolically connected to the unconventional, even revolutionary, sign of Aquarius. Uranus is exalted, or especially strong, in the sign of Scorpio, a sign of transformation that lends a sense of larger purpose to Uranus' radical changes. It's in its detriment in Leo, a sign whose emphasis on individual creativity is at odds with Uranus, which represents the principle of egalitarianism. And Uranus is in its fall in Taurus, a sign that values stability and security and doesn't welcome the kind of disruptive change symbolized by Uranus.

# The God: The Lightning Bolt
You've lived your whole life in a tiny, homogeneous, and fairly dull town in the middle of nowhere. It's the first day of seventh grade, and you're looking down the barrel of another long, boring school year, spending day after day with the same kids you've known since your mothers were in the hospital delivery room together.

Then, a latecomer enters the classroom. Your teacher asks the class to welcome Buzz, a new student from Malibu, California. Buzz wears the kind of clothes you've only seen on television, and he oozes as much cool confidence as a 12-year-old possibly can. As he shakes his hair out of his eyes and flashes a devastating grin, an electric current pulses through the classroom as the entire seventh grade—as one—falls a little bit in love with Buzz.

In a close-knit community, whether it's a classroom, workplace, or town, an outsider can have a tremendous impact. Buzz is occasionally baffled by your alien customs, and he asks questions that are innocent, but unsettling. Why aren't there any African Americans in your class? Why do people still smoke cigarettes and eat so much red meat in this part of the country? Friendships are tested as girls vie for Buzz's attention. Modest Midwestern boys spend hours in front of their bedroom mirrors, cultivating the "Buzz" look. Even Ms. Evans, your teacher, seems to wield her chalk with more energy.

And to you, suddenly, the world looks different.Why should you stay in one place your whole life, eating what your parents eat and following the unspoken rules of your upbringing? Finally, one night, as you watch your mom and dad light up cigarettes after their steak dinner, you blurt out, "I'm gonna be a vegetarian from now on, and I'm never, ever gonna smoke!" Their startled expressions tell you that you've turned into Buzz.

Astronomers pronounce Uranus "UR-uh-nus." Some folks (and all fifth-graders) pronounce it "Ur-AY-nus." And among astrologers I've also heard it pronounced "Ur-AH-nus." Any way you pronounce it, you're going to encounter some snickers from the peanut gallery. And, of course, that's just the way Uranus likes it.

# The Monster: The Outcast

Usually, a "Buzz" is a perfectly normal kid who is strange only by virtue of having been raised a bit differently, or having a distinctive personal style. But occasionally, a Buzz relishes his role as exotic and rebellious outsider. He pits friend against friend, daughter against parents, and teacher against principal. He exists to stir up trouble and controversy for their own sake, and to break down the happy associations that keep a community functioning smoothly. Like lightning, Uranus can generate electricity or wreak destruction.

And then, too, a Buzz might be somewhat less attractive, less cool, his "weirdness" less alluring. Then he becomes a sad exile whose occasional contributions to classroom discussions draw snickers, who eats alone at lunchtime, and who never seems to wear the right clothes or say the right thing. Uranus can represent the part of you that feels like an outcast—all rough, pointed edges, a square peg with no business trying to fit into a round hole. In society, entire classes of people can feel like outcasts, with no status or sense of belonging within their own culture.

What happens when an outcast has been cut off from society for too long?
Usually, he rebels against the culture that rejected him. Occasionally, he grows into his genius and changes the world. In extreme cases, he seeks to destroy it—through revolution, and sometimes with violence.

# Uranus in Signs

Uranus describes the outward style of your inner revolutionary. Because Uranus moves through the zodiac so slowly, everyone born within the same (roughly) seven-year period shares the same Uranus sign. As a generation, you and those who share your Uranus sign are helping to awaken society to prepare it for new insights and innovations in the areas represented by Uranus's sign.

_Astro Tip_

There is some overlap between the Uranus generations, while Uranus was making long retrograde journeys back into the previous sign. If you were born during a year when Uranus was changing signs, you'll need to look at your birth chart to find out exactly where it was at your birth.

## Uranus in Aries (1928–1934; 2010–2018)

—The lightning bolt: A can-do spirit, the ability to cope with upheaval and revolution, a knack for survival. The outcast: Survivalism; united with others only for the purposes of waging war.

# Saturn's Dad

Uranus was initially named Herschel, after its discoverer, Sir William Herschel. The name, incongruous among the mythical names of the other planets, never really caught on outside of Herschel's own Britain. It was astronomer Johann Elert Bode who suggested that the new planet, orbiting on the outside of Saturn, should be named after Saturn's father, just as Saturn, orbiting on the outside of Jupiter, was named after Jupiter's father. Herschel proposed the name Uranus, the Latin version of Ouranos, Greek god of the sky.

# Uranus in Houses

Uranus's house placement in your chart marks the areas where your generation's rebelliousness and innovation collides with your personal experiences. It's where you, personally, are rebellious, innovative, iconoclastic, and determined to do things your own way. It's also the symbol for the triggers that can literally drive you crazy if you're prevented from exercising your freedom in a particular area of life.

# Uranus in your first house

—The lightning bolt: You do things no one ever imagined doing, blazing new trails for "your people" and going head-to-head with societal rules and mores. The outcast: Your appearance is distinctive and unusual, you're uncompromising, and you're kind of hard to get close to. You’re unpredictable and can be destructive when your freedom is threatened.

# Uranus in your second house

The lightning bolt: Your philanthropy or quirky attitude toward money and possessions awakens others to new ideas about what is valuable. You demand freedom from financial constraints; you don't want to be "owned" by either your money or your poverty. The outcast: Your financial status, whether extreme poverty or wealth, may set you apart from those around you.

# Uranus in your third house

The lightning bolt: You awaken the world with new ways to think, educate, and communicate. You insist on the freedom to speak your mind without interference or censorship. The outcast: The way you think and speak sets you apart as radical...

# Uranus in your fourth house

The lightning bolt: You offer the world with new ideas about what it means to belong to a family or to a country. You seek freedom from family obligations, traditions, and allegiances of birth or nation. The outcast: Emotionally estranged from your family, uncomfortable in your own country, difficulty forming meaningful emotional connections.

# Uranus in your fifth house

The lightning bolt: You refuse to be told who you are, who you can be, or how to express yourself. You demand that the world adopt new attitudes about the importance of individual freedom, expression, and happiness. The outcast: Your creative interests or your attitudes toward sex or child-rearing mark you as different or even radical.

# Uranus in your sixth house

The lightning bolt: You're very good at figuring out innovative solutions to mundane problems. You refuse to conform to rules about work, health, or wealth. The outcast: Everyday rebellion. In the movie *The Wild One*, Marlon Brando's character is asked, "What're you rebelling against, Johnny?" His reply: "Whaddya got?"

# Uranus in your seventh house

—The lightning bolt: You are able to think about relationships and social justice in fresh, innovative, fair ways. Your relationships will be very different from the ones you grew up watching. If your parents were advocates of free love who refused to get married, you're likely to walk down the aisle at an early age. The outcast: You can be a bit socially "tone deaf," missing social cues. By turning your back of societal rules about relationships, you also forfeit some of society's support for conventional relationships such as marriage.

# Uranus in your eighth house

—The lightning bolt: You are able to break down barriers between people, and organize others to use shared resources for good. You will do almost anything to avoid being subject to someone else's control. The outcast: You're not good at sharing, may seem a little scary, and don't respect people's privacy.

# Uranus in your ninth house

—The lightning bolt: You have an innovative way of thinking about the world of knowledge and beliefs. You take an unconventional educational path and generally hold religious or philosophical beliefs that are very different from those of the people around you. You feel strongly about religious freedom. The outcast: The best way for someone to ensure you will never, under any circumstances, subscribe to his or her belief system is to tell you it's the only one that's valid and that bad things will happen if you don't believe. Sometimes this amounts to cutting off your nose to spite your face.

# Uranus in your tenth house

—The lightning bolt: You refuse to follow the career path that's expected of you, preferring to follow your own unorthodox calling. You're a born leader, one who shakes up the status quo and promises a more egalitarian approach to government. The outcast: You just don't get the way the world works. You're constantly in trouble with parents, teachers, cops, bosses, anyone in authority. It can be hard for you to achieve much because it's hard for you to commit to a goal.

# Uranus in your eleventh house

The lightning bolt: You refuse to give in to peer pressure, and yet you have a talent for bringing people together. The outcast: You probably like people, but you really don't have a feel for group interactions. You are good at bringing groups of people together, but you dislike the politics that inevitably emerge, so you quickly distance yourself.

# Uranus in your twelfth house

The lightning bolt: You see the world and all its people as interconnected. You refuse to be controlled by fear, bigotry, illness, or imprisonment. The outcast: You're a bit too sensitive and impractical to deal with other people much on a regular basis. You may love everyone in theory, but in reality you need lots of quiet time alone.

# Your Inner Angel: Neptune

None of us is a saint. But all of us have the ability, on our best days, to be a little bit better than we'd imagined we could be. We have moments of real grace, kindness, and compassion. We can turn the other cheek. We put another's feelings ahead of our own. We show faith and forbearance in the face of tragedy, and offer kindness to strangers. No, we're not saints. But on a good day, we can behave as though we were. Neptune symbolizes how, and in what circumstances, you are most likely to show your sweetest, most compassionate side.

Neptune is symbolically connected to the compassionate, spiritually sensitive, artistic sign of Pisces. Its signs of exaltation and fall have not been determined; but its sign of detriment is Virgo, whose practical, discriminating, and analytical nature makes an uncomfortable home for Neptune's unconditional love, intuition, and faith.

Misc.

# Neptune Fast Facts

* Key concepts—Spirituality, compassion, unconditional love, empathy, art, psychic sensitivity
* Cycle—Takes 165 years to complete a cycle of the zodiac
* Rules—Pisces
* Exalted—Not determined
* Detriment—Virgo
* Fall—Not determined
* Glyph—Poseidon's trident
* Anatomy—Feet, pineal gland, white corpuscles of the blood, spinal column

# The God: The Dream
Every now and then, usually when I've been driving too much, I get to feeling pretty exasperated with my fellow man. I start griping to my poor husband, loudly and at some length, about how perfectly nice, civilized people become animals the minute they get behind the wheel. Wringing my hands (metaphorically, for my actual hands are on the wheel, I promise), I bemoan the general breakdown civility in modern society, always ending up on the same thought. "The heck of it is," I'll observe to my (now glassy-eyed, desperate for this familiar monologue to end) spouse, “If I were crossing the street right now and got hit by a car, probably a dozen people would stop their cars and run over to help me."

It's true: disaster and human suffering bring out the best in people. Watch video footage of the aftermath of a disaster. There is suffering, yes; also pain, deprivation, loss, even death. Chaos reigns—rubble in the streets, ashes, bits of aircraft, flooding. But there are also feet on the ground, rushing around with food, water, medicine, and tourniquets, voices clamoring to donate blood.

And even many miles away, most of us instinctively open our hearts, our wallets, our pantries, or our guestrooms, ready to help. In a moment of almost painful clarity, we see what's important and real: our connection to other humans. Make it a big enough disaster shared by enough of us, and the usual distinctions of status, gender, race, and age evaporate completely. We're one people, brothers and sisters; we love each other, and we'd do anything for one another. Neptune, the god of oneness, has washed us into each other's arms and baptized us in unconditional love.

# The Monster: Not My Problem
But what if it wasn't a big enough disaster? What if the only people affected were not like us—didn't speak the same language, have the same skin color, or worship the same god? Maybe we watch the news for a little while, initially stunned at the misery unfolding before our eyes—but then we quickly find a way to absolve ourselves from caring. "They should never have built a city there." "Why did they build with stones in a place that gets massive earthquakes?" "I'm broke and they're halfway around the world; it's not like there's anything I can do for them." And we turn the channel, and convince ourselves that those people have nothing to do with us.

Neptune is described as the planet of deception, escapism, and denial. And when Neptune is in his Monster mode, the sensitivity and compassion that serve us so well in a catastrophe are brushed under the rug. We sense the truth—"I don't love him, he doesn't love me, I don't deserve that raise"—but we choose to ignore it. We watch others suffering and pretend we can't do anything about it, and in order to absolve our guilt we blame the victim. The cheater thinks, "It's not my fault he was stupid enough to trust me." The thief believes, "She was just asking to be robbed." Instead of talking to the ones we love about things that are important, we spend our evenings drinking, eating too much, smoking dope, or surfing the Internet for hours at a time.

Neptune is often associated with negative qualities, especially deception. But while those who practice deception almost certainly have strong Neptune placements in their chart, not all with strong Neptune choose to use it in a negative or destructive way. Beware of interpreting Neptune in your chart, or anyone else's, with the assumption that it means deception, substance abuse, insanity, or any of the other traditional Neptune scourges.

# Neptune in Signs

Neptune describes the outward style of your inner saint. Because Neptune moves through the zodiac so slowly, everyone born within a 13- to 14-year period shares the same Neptune sign. As a generation, you are moving society toward a specific dream of spiritual enlightenment; and from time to time, you awaken to find the world isn't necessarily the way you thought it was.

_Astro Tip_

There is some overlap between the Neptune generations, while Neptune was making long retrograde journeys back into the previous sign. If you were born during a year when Neptune was changing signs, you'll need to look at your birth chart to find out exactly where it was at your birth.

**Neptune in Aries (1861-1875; 2025-2039)** —The dream: An individual person (or nation) can save the world. All men are created equal. The awakening: As the American Civil War demonstrated, fighting wars doesn't necessarily make anyone free or equal.

**Neptune in Taurus (1874–1889; 2038-2052)** —The dream: A gilded age of wealth and luxury, impressionistic art, opulence and philanthropy. The awakening: Bitter racial and class divisions. The poor wish to dream their own dreams.

**Neptune in Gemini (1888–1902; 2051-2066)** —The dream: Efficiency of production, better access to transportation, the ability to communicate more efficiently and effectively. The awakening: The products aren't necessarily any better, there’s not necessarily any place worth traveling to, and there aren’t necessarily any ideas worth communicating. 

# Neptune in different signs

Neptune in Cancer (1901–1915)—The dream: Willingness to sacrifice for family and nation; security, caring, and patriotism as ideals. The awakening: Safety is an illusion, and anyone who promises it is not to be trusted.

Neptune in Leo (1915–1929)—The dream: Glamour, mesmerizing forms of entertainment, getting rich quick, and the party that never ends. The awakening: The party always ends eventually, and there's a lot of cleaning up to do when it does.

Neptune in Virgo (1929–1943)—The dream: The highest values are service, usefulness, and sacrifice. Anything is possible if you're willing to work hard. The awakening: Sometimes, hard work is not rewarded, sacrifice is not appreciated, and your real responsibility is not to a noble cause, but to the fellow fighting alongside of you.

Neptune in Libra (1943–1955)—The dream: All you need is love! Make love, not war! Peace! Can't we all just get along, man? As long as we both shall love ... The awakening: Nice guys finish last. Creating art is great, but even better if it pays the bills. The problem with being free to love anyone you want is that the people you love are free to do the same thing.

Neptune in Scorpio (1956–1970)—The dream: Sacred sexuality, Eastern philosophy, mysticism, creating sexually themed art and music, abandoning romanticism. The awakening: Sex and intimacy are not the same thing. Having all the answers doesn't mean you're asking the right questions.

Neptune in Sagittarius (1971–1984)—The dream: Cleaning up government, thinking up a new vision, believing in something. The awakening: Nothing you believed is true. None of the institutions who taught you your values can be trusted.

# Neptune in Capricorn (1985-1998)

The dream: We are the world. Dissolving of national borders. Global activism and practical dreams. The awakening: Multinational corporations, decentralized government, corporatized faith.

# Neptune in Aquarius (1998-2012)

The dream: The entire world connected by technology. Shared knowledge. The awakening: Mass delusion, wide-scale groupthink, the emergence of radical fringe groups.

# Neptune in Pisces (2012-2025)

The dream: Boundaries between individuals and nations are dissolved. Empathy and compassion as universal ideals. The awakening: Scapegoating, environmental disintegration, denial of reality.

# Neptune: Catch a Wave

Neptune is the Roman version of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, storms, and earthquakes. Astrologically, Uranus is more closely associated with earthquakes, but Neptune retains bragging rights over rain, flooding, and tidal waves. He also gets to carry around that cool trident (which provided the inspiration for his glyph).

# Neptune in Houses

Neptune's house placement in your chart personalizes the generational themes of Neptune in the signs, and indicates where you seek enlightenment, escape, and spiritual meaning in life. When it's being expressed negatively, Neptune can describe where you get lost in a fog of deception or denial.

# Neptune in your first house

We are one: Willingness to fight for and defend others and to champion your beliefs. *Not my problem*: Feeling that nothing is worth fighting for. Difficulty exerting your personality; projected anger.

# Neptune in your seventh house

We are one: You believe in love, peace, and fairness. You're able to understand others, meet them on their level, and accept them. You have the ability to create a truly loving and equal partnership. *Not my problem* Escaping into your relationships; letting partnership overshadow your own identity. You can be deceived by partners or give too much in a relationship.

# Neptune in Your eighth house

We are one: You believe in magic and the ability to transform. You love what is broken.

* **Anatomy**—Elimination and reproductive systems, abnormal growths, pituitary gland

# The God: Fearless

The goal of Pluto is to make you strong—to give you the kind of strength that comes with integrity, and living clean without secrets, dishonesty, or waste. Pluto is the plumber who keeps the nasty consequences of being human rushing through pipes and away from your house. He's the garbage collector who takes away your smelly, unneeded refuse. He's the chemotherapy that kills cancerous cells. He's the awesome movie character, known as a "fixer," who shows up after a murder has been committed to quietly and efficiently remove all evidence of the crime.

Pluto has only one interest: to get rid of what isn't making you strong. Our attachments in this world are what cause us pain—attachment to a body, to possessions, to other people. Pluto takes a hard, clinical glance at you and says, "What can this person do without? What is weighing this person down, undermining her?" And then he takes it away, whether or not you felt you were finished with it.
Losing other people is probably the hardest Pluto lesson we learn. We lose the ability to interact with someone we loved; we lose the person we were when we were around them. But speaking as someone who has lost half my family, I can say that they probably left when the time was right. It might not have been the right time for me, but I'm fairly certain it was the right time for them.

# The Monster: Fearful

As I said, there are plenty of things to fear in life. People who know about astrology often fear times when Pluto will be active in their chart by transit (see Chapter 23) because they imagine at least a few of those awful things will happen to them. And when bad things happen in life—when things are taken away from us that we really don't want to give up—Pluto is invariably nearby, lurking in the shadows.

Someone gets chemotherapy, a treatment that many claim is worse than the disease it treats and worse than death. It might take away diseased cells and give you a chance to keep living but it can make you feel as though you don't necessarily want to keep living. Monster Pluto is a cancer of nihilism, taking away zest for living.

# Pluto: Planet or Planetoid?

Discovered in 1930, Pluto was considered our solar system's ninth planet until 2006, when it was demoted to "dwarf planet" status by the International Astronomical Union. This decision was not without controversy in the scientific community, with many astronomers objecting to the decision. The decision was almost entirely without controversy in the astrological community, however: astrologers still overwhelmingly include Pluto in their charts.

# Pluto in Signs
Pluto describes the outward style of your inner terminator. Because Pluto moves through the zodiac so slowly, everyone born within roughly 20 years of you shares the same Pluto sign. As a generation, you are helping society achieve greater strength and integrity by removing the dead wood of dishonesty, artifice, hubris, and anything else that's unnecessary. Together, you create a myth that defines your generation. But every generation also has a shadow side, in which unacknowledged fears become potentially destructive.

There is some overlap between the Pluto generations, while Pluto was making long retrograde journeys back into the previous sign. If you were born during a year when Pluto was changing signs, you'll need to look at your birth chart to find out exactly where Pluto was at your birth.

## Pluto in Aries (1822-1851)

- The myth: The Wild West, celebrating rugged individualism and pioneer spirit.
- The shadow: Impulsive, self-serving violence. Genocide.

## Pluto in Taurus (1851-1884)

- The myth: The golden age of agriculture, a time of enormous wealth and ease for privileged landowners.
- The shadow: Getting rich off the backs of others. Slavery.

## Pluto in Gemini (1882–1913)

- The myth: Transformation of travel, communications, and paradigm-busting novelists like Hemingway and Fitzgerald.
- The shadow: The sinking of Titanic and the mixed blessing of automation.

## Pluto in Cancer (1912–1939)

- The myth: Fighting to protect the safety and security of family and nation. Doing anything to make sure your family is fed.
- The shadow: Isolationism... Not allowing others to face hardships that build strength and character.

## Pluto in Leo (1937–1958)

The other looks kind of like an atomic mushroom cloud—an appropriate symbol for the planet associated with nuclear weapons.
