## Fire Signs

Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius are the fire signs: dynamic, passionate, and inspiring

Aries is dynamic, energetic, and a born leader and pioneer

Leo is creative, inspiring, and dramatic

Sagittarius is philosophical, scholarly, and adventurous

Gaze into a roaring fire and feel yourself growing relaxed and mesmerized; this is what it feels like to bask in the glow of people who embody the spirit of the fire signs. Harnessing the energy of fire can keep you warm in winter, make your food tastier, and let you bend metal into useful tools. Understanding the needs and objectives of fire sign people can help you enjoy their warmth, zest for living, and helpful qualities—without being burned to a crisp by their incandescent personalities.

Walk into any gathering and you'll easily spot the people who have fire signs strongly represented in their birth charts. The great looking woman surrounded by admirers, the guy who dashed in late and left in a hurry, and the one holding forth about his political views—for better or worse, fire sign people capture your attention.

Enthusiastic, charismatic, spontaneous, inspiring: at their best, fire signs draw us in like a cozy fire on a cold evening. But just as uncontrolled fire quickly becomes dangerous, negative fire sign people can show a destructive side that's bossy, opinionated, pushy, and overbearing.

While the three fire signs have a lot in common with one another, each brings something unique to the table. Aries, the cardinal fire sign, symbolizes initiative, drive, and pioneer spirit. Fixed sign Leo emphasizes the cultivation of healthy ego and creativity, applying existing resources to individual self-expression. And Sagittarius, a mutable sign, symbolizes the urge to synthesize knowledge and experience into a cohesive belief system, and to formulate a vision that broadens our understanding of the world

# Aries, the Ram

Though we set aside January 1 to draft New Year's resolutions, the Sun's ingress into Aries at the vernal equinox marks the real beginning of the new year. As the sign that welcomes spring's exhilarating flush of warmer weather, refreshing rains, and the first brave shoots of green after winter's fierceness, Aries symbolizes new beginnings and the return of physical potency. The sap is rising, our zest for life is renewed, and we're ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work.

For farmers and gardeners, this is an important time of year to prepare soil for new seeds. It's hard work, and the association of spring with toothy metal implements and back-breaking labor contributed to Aries's association with the planet Mars, ruler of physical work, and with metal and iron.

As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries is akin to a newborn baby: terribly small and vulnerable, without language, it must learn from the moment of its first full-throated holler how to get its needs met so it can survive. Likewise, Aries people learn to cultivate the independence and courage that allow them to thrive on insecurity, and on the thrilling terror of new experiences. Consequently, Aries natives are fiercely independent, courageous leaders, and alive with pioneer spirit. Like their symbol, the ram, they tend to jump into situations headfirst—and they never, ever back down from a challenge.

You are most likely to identify with Aries if

* You were born with the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant in Aries or in close aspect to Mars.
* You were born with a number of planets in the first house.
* You were born with Mars in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house.
 
# What Makes Aries Tick

Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and that's an easy way to remember what makes Aries run: Aries wants to be first. It's more important for you to do something first, in fact, than for you to do it best. You want to be your sweetheart's first love, the first kid in your class to get a driver's license, the first among your group of friends to be kissed; in adulthood you have to be the first in your field, the innovator, the pioneer. You have no interest in any race you can't win, and you can't stand doing the same thing day after day. Aries hits the ground running from the minute you leave the womb, and you'll never stop running, and striving, until you becomes the first of your friends to arrive at the pearly gates.

Aries loves a challenge. You relish overcoming obstacles and thrive on being told something is impossible, then finding a way to do it. You're ruled by the planet Mars, named for the god of war, and some Aries types do thrive on military warfare and have an affinity for weapons and a high tolerance for bloodshed. Just as many, though, find there are more than enough battles to fight in civilian life—to get ahead, blaze new trails, and develop courage and confidence.

Aries has courage and confidence to spare. The danger you face is becoming addicted to adrenalin and to doing things your own way, no matter what. You need allies who will help you temper your impulsive qualities and learn to play well with others.

Aries at its best: Brave, assertive, pioneering, quick, determined

Aries on a bad day: Aggressive, hard-headed, selfish, impulsive, impatient, brutal

# How to Spot an Aries
Aries is the first to arrive and the first to leave. The one who can't sit still for long and who's not a very good listener. The impulse shopper. The impatient foot tapper. The brave pioneer who boldly goes not only where no man has gone before, but where no man ever even thought about going before. And though chivalry is as good as dead, its embers smolder in the heart of Aries—so the stranger who shimmied up a tree to retrieve your stranded tabby is the epitome of a positive Aries. Sign this person up to lead your neighborhood watch or your office safety program.

A malfunctioning Aries is easy to spot, too. He won't share his toys, can't stand buying a used car (because he wasn't the first to own it), and interrupts you when you talk. He tailgates you on the freeway, leaves abusive comments on your blog, shoves other kids off the teeter-totter, walks away distractedly in the middle of a conversation, or threatens to punch you when he gets drunk.

Above all, Aries needs to feel confident that he can get what he needs to survive. An Aries who has had to struggle too much for basic food, shelter, or attention can easily fall into a morass of anger. But an Aries who has learned that he can rely on himself when the chips are down is a calm, unflappable ninja.

The Aries archetype : Prince Lancelot, the brave and romantic rock star of King Arthur's court

The Aries stereotype : The rage-a-holic in the pickup truck who just gave you the finger after cutting you off on the freeway

How to handle an angry Aries? Leave him alone! Don't placate him, and don't fight back; it will just make things worse. Back off and give Aries space to cool down and collect his thoughts; he rarely stays angry for long.

# Aries in Love

Ah, Aries in love. You make your lovers feel like the most special, attractive, precious, and endearing creatures who ever lived. But thanks to your sign's legendarily short attention span, the thrill doesn't necessarily last.

Aries loves a challenge, so you're fascinated by partners who are difficult to pin down. Once you've won someone's heart, that person had better keep you guessing and make you work hard to hold onto her, or else you'll soon grow bored and find some other quarry to chase. Aries tend to be uncommonly attached to conventional gender roles, so your men need to be rugged and dashing, your women dainty and ladylike.

Male or female, you tend to sweep people off their feet and, if things don't go well, to drop them just as expediently. Aries was probably the inspiration for the phrase, "Marry in haste, repent at leisure." For Aries, compromise does not come naturally. You do not instinctively take your partner into consideration before doing something (leaving your job, buying a new car, deciding to move to another country). You have to be taught to take another person into consideration; if you're with the right person, it's a lesson you'll happily learn—but the "we" of partnership will never feel quite like your native language, "I."

Most compatible signs: Fellow fire signs Leo and Sagittarius, who share your passionate nature; air signs Gemini and Aquarius, who are able to keep their cool when you lose yours

Most challenging signs: Opposite sign Libra; Cancer and Capricorn—like you, all three enjoy taking the lead, and Aries doesn't like to follow.

# Aries at Work

It comes down to this, really: Aries can't abide being told what to do. Mostly, this is because you want to do things no one else has done before, and almost no boss can even imagine why you want to do them. Still, Aries doesn't particularly want to be in charge, either, though you do have natural leadership ability. Rather, you want to be left alone to do your work in exactly the way that suits you, at precisely the speed that feels right for you. And that speed, usually, will be fast—very fast.

Aries is best at starting things—you're a natural entrepreneur—and especially at tackling feats that daunt lesser mortals. Not all Aries fight fires, rescue people, or charge in to life-threatening situations on a regular basis, but it's a safe bet that people who do this kind of work have Aries or Mars strong in their birth charts.

If Aries were to envision hell, it would involve sitting at a desk performing repetitive tasks day in, day out. You're interested in doing something exactly as long as it takes you to figure out how it should be done; then you need a new challenge. Surprisingly, though, you can be very pragmatic—and co-workers should watch their backs, because you can also be ambitious, even ruthless.

Aries-friendly careers: Traditionally, Aries was associated with careers involving sharp objects, such as surgery; weapons, such as the armed forces; and athletic skill. Aries may also be well suited to dangerous professions like fire fighting, and those that require poise under pressure, such as medical triage. Many Aries, though, can be relatively content in just about any career that offers constant challenge and independence, including soldiers, firefighters, or law enforcement; physical or speech therapist; welder or carpenter; hairdressers or other careers having to do with the head.

## Leo, the Lion

In the northern hemisphere, the Sun is in Leo during the hottest month of the year. Leo's season is a popular one for vacations and for recreation of all kinds—and appropriately, Leo is the sign associated with recreation and play. The most social of the big cats, lions hunt and live as part of a pride. Similarly, those born with Leo prominent in the birth chart are sociable and playful, balancing times of relaxation with periods of intense hunting and fighting. Picture Leo's totem, the lion, lying indolently beneath a shade tree in the heat of the afternoon.

The fixed nature of Leo makes it the most dependable of the fire signs. When you set your signs on a goal (usually involving recognition) you pursue it steadily, even doggedly, until you've reached it. Leo's constancy and organizational savvy regularly take the uninitiated by surprise. Beneath Leo's surface razzle-dazzle is, in fact, a steady friend in need, a loyal employee, and a devoted partner.

You are most likely to identify with the sign Leo if

* You were born with the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant in Leo, or with the Moon or Ascendant in close aspect to the Sun.
* You were born with a number of planets in the fifth house.
* You were born with the Sun in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house.

# What Makes Leo Tick

Aries wants to be first, but Leo wants to be the best and wants to be loved. To be second best is worse than no prize at all to Leo. Best looking, best at her job, best lover, best dressed—as long as she's acknowledged as the unrivaled master of her realm, Leo will be reasonably content.

Leo is known as the "creative" sign, which immediately brings to mind visions of paste and glitter, guitars and greasepaint. What is creativity, anyway? It's the joining of resources and individual genius. Leo people are often renaissance men and women, adept at many different artistic pursuits—indeed, pretty good at most anything they try. This is not because Leo is necessarily more gifted than anyone else, but rather because Leo is willing to bring her entire self to everything she does. Any work, any creation, any relationship is an opportunity for Leo to express her whole heart.

Leo oozes charisma, talent, and heart. The danger you face is isolating yourself through your demand to be treated as something special. Your closest friends and loved ones will give you the gift of never taking you too seriously—and will help you remember that though you are, in fact, special, so is everyone else.

Leo at its best: Regal, creative, magnetic, performer, generous, inspiring

Leo on a bad day: Vain, domineering, attention seeking, insecure

# How to Spot a Leo

Not a problem. If she looks as though she's ready to lay the side of a sword on a commoner's shoulder, or uses phrases like "We are not amused," you've got a Leo on your hands. There are loud Leos and quiet ones, but all of them are proud and, in their way, dignified. Leo may clown around with friends to get some laughs, but don't make the mistake of acting too familiar or of assuming you and Leo are equals. Her Majesty is warm, hospitable, and generous, but she is a little more special than you are, and don't you forget it.

Of course, there are benevolent monarchs and then there are ruthless dictators, which bear more than a passing resemblance to Leo when she is off her game. A Leo who is feeling insecure or overlooked can be overbearing, overtly vain, and even cruel. If you've ever seen a lion maul its prey in one of those nature documentaries, or even watched your pet tabby toy with a bird or mouse, you get the general idea.

Leo is the life of the party, the belle of the ball, the king of the castle. The one thing she is not—ever—is just another face in the crowd.

The Leo archetype : The benevolent monarch

The Leo stereotype : The shallow playboy or party girl

## Leo in Love

Leo has to be the star of the show, needs to be adored, will turn to ice if neglected or betrayed. What's needed is a sort of royal consort, someone with the confidence and wry humor to hold his own in Leo's reflected glory

Handling a Leo in a romantic relationship is dead easy, however, for someone who has the right temperament. You need a partner who is absolutely self-confident, has a negligible desire for attention, possesses the gift of being smooth flattery, and is brave enough to stand up to you when you start to roar.

The good news is that with the right partner, Leo is loyal, protective, and an excellent provider. Lions mate for life, and unless you are betrayed or embarrassed by your partner, so do you!

Most compatible signs: Fellow fire signs Aries and Sagittarius, who understand your dramatic nature and aren't intimidated by you;d air signs Gemini and Libra, who are experts at flattery.

Most challenging signs: Opposite sign Aquarius; Taurus and Scorpio—all three are as stubborn as you are.

According to Debra Ronca in "How Lion Taming Works" (HowStuffWorks.com), here's how to tame a lion (works with Leos, too!):

* Introduce yourself slowly over time to earn trust
* Distract with multiple focus of attention
* Use positive reinforcement to shape behavior
* Respect the animal: you never know when it may attack

# Leo at Work

President Bill Clinton, born with the Sun in Leo, was responsible for one of my favorite quotations about this sign. "Just think what it's like to be president," he mused. "They play a song every time you walk in the room. I was completely lost for three weeks after I left the White House. Nobody ever played a song any more." He was joking, of course ... but no one who knows anything about Leo would be a bit surprised if he were a bit serious, too.

Most everyone wants to be recognized for the work they do. But it takes a Leo—or someone with that sign or its ruler, the Sun, very strong in the birth chart—to make being recognized a profession in and of itself. It's why Leo is a great sign for anything requiring performance—the arts, teaching and training, or leading workshops and seminars. Leo tends to be most comfortable in front of a group of people; you feel like you disappear when you're one of a crowd. But you're more than just an attention-seeking ham:

Leo is also adept at inspiring others to do their best, and is surprisingly organized and reliable.

Leo-friendly careers: Leo makes an effective teacher, manager, or self-help speaker because you have a talent for motivating people. You're also well suited to a career in the arts or connected to entertainment (including parties), since you're creative, comfortable in front of an audience, and enjoy creating your own schedules and routines. Leo is also a sign of gaming and speculation, and can do well as stockbrokers, working in casinos, or developing video games.

# Sagittarius, the Archer
# The Sun rises in Sagittarius

The Sun rises in Sagittarius in the short, cold days leading up the winter solstice, when the waning afternoon sunlight invites us to sit by a fire and think big thoughts. What is life all about? What happens after we die? Is there a God? Sagittarius is at home anyplace where he suspects answers to big questions can be found—in a classroom, a church, or a foreign land, or between the covers of a book.

Sagittarius is symbolized by the archer, usually represented as a centaur wielding a bow and arrow, or sometimes simply by the archer's arrow itself. Sagittarius is an interesting blend of cultured—even erudite—and uncivilized. The arrow that serves as his glyph represents a configuration in the constellation Sagittarius that points toward Antares, the star known as "the heart of the Scorpion." Sagittarius seeks not just the truth (as does the previous sign in the horoscope, Scorpio), but also an understanding of the truth. Sagittarius naturally looks for meaning—pictures in clouds and in Rorschach tests, a philosophy of life in sacred texts and the earth's natural order.

## Definition

A centaur, from the Greek word for "hand," is a mythical creature that is half man, half beast. It is often depicted as having two natures, an untamed one and a scholarly one. Among astrologers, the centaur Chiron from Greek mythology is often thought to be associated with Sagittarius.

You are most likely to identify with the sign Sagittarius if

* You were born with the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant in Sagittarius or in close aspect to Jupiter.
* You were born with a number of planets in the ninth house.
* You were born with Jupiter in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house.

# What Makes Sagittarius Tick
# Sagittarius

Sagittarius is the mutable fire sign, indicating flexibility and willingness to change course when necessary. In Sagittarius, the creative vigor of the fire element is married to the ability to stretch the mind and imagine new possibilities and even new worlds. The result—as in the case of entertainment geniuses Steven Spielberg and Walt Disney, both born with the Sun in Sagittarius—can be spectacular.

Sagittarius isn't interested in details; you're too focused on the forest to take note of individual trees. While Sagittarius isn't a cardinal sign, all the fire signs are natural leaders simply by virtue of your ability to inspire others. Most people want to be involved in something that means something—and whether you're heading a science lab, fronting a band, or directing a film, those who are involved with you tend to be fans of yours as well.

Sagittarius knows plenty. The danger he faces is in believing he knows everything. He has a lot to share, and needs a platform for teaching and preaching—but he also needs trusted friends and loved ones who can help him keep his mind open to new ideas.

Sagittarius at its best: Philosophical, adventurous, freedom loving, scholarly, funny, honest, athletic, traveler

Sagittarius on a bad day: Crude, blunt, know-it-all, arrogant, superior, intolerant

# How to Spot a Sagittarius

On a good day, Sagittarius makes you think. He's the fellow chatting animatedly about an arcane point of philosophy, laughing loudly at his own jokes, or shrugging off a slight. At best, Sagittarius symbolizes optimism, broad-mindedness, generosity, wisdom, and humor. Woody Allen, born with the Sun in Sagittarius, is a prototypical archer whose comedic films feature protagonists obsessed with life, death, and the symbolism-rich films of Ingmar Bergman.



Unfortunately, a less inspiring form of Sagittarius also roams the earth. He's your pompous, know-it-all neighbor, the wild-eyed zealot who knocks on your door to proselytize, the relative whose blunt observations over Sunday dinner make your entire family bristle.

But these are Sagittarians who've never had someone to listen to them and tell them they're smart. At heart, every Sagittarius is a guru, a soulful clown, and a freedom-loving hobo who's just passing through.

**The Sagittarius archetype**: The wayfaring stranger who transforms a community with his knowledge and wisdom before moving on

**The Sagittarius stereotype**: The clown who trips over his gigantic shoes and throws pies in your face

## Sagittarius in Love

Conventional relationships can be difficult for this freedom-loving sign. Sagittarius needs plenty of space; he's designed to explore the whole world, and he'll never be content with just a little part of it. If you want to spend your life with Sagittarius, you'd best love to laugh, be a good listener, and be content spending lots of time on your own.

Pair Sagittarius with an independent Aries or Aquarian, a fun-loving Leo, or an accommodating Libra, and he can do well. And compared with his zodiacal counterparts, Sagittarius fares well when teamed with his opposite—Gemini, a similarly cerebral and idea-loving sign.

Most compatible signs: Fellow fire signs, Aries and Leo, who share your enthusiasm and outgoing nature; air signs Libra and Aquarius, who appeal to your intellectual side and help civilize you with their social acumen

Most challenging: Opposite sign Gemini; Virgo and Pisces

## Sagittarius at Work


Sagittarius is a visionary, able to see a world others can't imagine. You gravitate toward any work that allows you to consider situations and ideas in a broader context and derive meaning from them. Simply put, Sagittarius likes to make sense of things. To feel happy in your work, Sagittarius must feel that your daily tasks have meaning and contribute to a better understanding of the world.

Traveling, sharing ideas, and spending time in the natural world are dear to the archer's heart, and any work that includes these elements will make you happy. For instance, I know a Sagittarius who is an academic in the physical sciences and who travels extensively, giving lectures; he couldn't be happier with his career. But any workplace that values thinking and meaning and allows flexibility and freedom will provide an agreeable environment for you.

Sagittarius-friendly careers: Sagittarius has traditionally been associated with careers in academia, publishing, philosophy, writing, engineering, theology, or the clergy. Sagittarius also makes an excellent travel guide, since he loves to travel and stores up plenty of interesting stories to share with travelers. Sagittarius and its ruling planet, Jupiter, are also connected to large animals, so working with or around horses, cows, or jungle animals is a good fit.
