# Gods and Monsters: Planets

Named for figures from mythology, the planets of our solar system dazzled our ancestors as they strutted across the sky's stage. Planets move through the signs of the zodiac at varying speeds, changing costumes (signs) and sets (the houses of your chart) along the way, improvising dialogue (aspects) as their proximity to one another changes. Watching the planets moving across the sky was the closest thing our ancestors had to television. Ancient sky watchers invented stories based on what they observed when particular planets were prominent in the sky. Sometimes the planets behaved well, like gods; other times they were mischievous, angry, or immoral, like monsters. Sometimes their dialogue was tender, sometimes rough. After all this time, human nature hasn't changed, and neither has the sky; and the stories our ancestors told about the planets are timeless.

These gods of love, war, money, and learning represent your personal mythology as well. If life were a play, the planets would be its players. In this part, you'll meet the planetary players of your chart, and learn what their sign and house placement say about you. Are they gods or monsters? That's up to you.

## The Intimate Circle: Personal Planets

The Sun, symbol of the sense of self that holds your inner "universe" together
The Moon, symbol of nurturing and protective influences
Mercury, symbol of how you think and express yourself
Venus, symbol of what gives you pleasure

The Sun, Moon, Mercury, and Venus are often called the "personal planets." Because they move through the zodiac relatively quickly, their placements differ more from day to day than those of their more ponderous planetary brethren.

They're planets of subjectivity, symbolizing your essential character—your identity, security and instincts, thought processes, and pleasures.

## Your Inner Superstar: The Sun

"I'm not myself today," you might tell a friend when you've just behaved in an uncharacteristic way. Snappish when you're normally calm, hasty when you're ordinarily careful; whether you're under stress or just didn't get a good night's sleep, feeling like you're "not yourself" can be disorienting.

But what does it mean to be "yourself "? In astrology, the Sun symbolizes identity—what makes you you. The symbol for the Sun—a tiny speck surrounded by a circle—is a bit like the bull's-eye of a target, with the astrological Sun describing both the goals that you're aiming for and how you must develop yourself as an individual in order to reach that target.

The Sun also symbolizes confidence, and those situations and pursuits that, when you're "not yourself," help restore your feeling that the world makes sense again. Each of us begins life as a tiny, nearly invisible speck; surrounds ourself with empty, insulating space; and then builds a solid circle around it all, a boundary to safely contain our fearsome smallness.

The Sun rules the sign of Leo, and is said to be exalted, or especially strong, in the sign of Aries. Its themes of identity and self-expression are a more challenging fit for the signs of Aquarius (detriment), which feels most itself in a group; and Libra (fall), which is most at home in a partnership.

Essential dignities are a system of evaluating the essential strengths of a planet based on its sign or degree. A planet is considered most strong in the signs of its rulership or exaltation, which are the signs whose symbolism is essentially compatible with the planet's objectives. A planet is considered least strong in the signs of its detriment (the sign opposite its rulership) and fall (the sign opposite its exaltation); these are signs whose symbolism is essentially at odds with the planet's purpose.

# The God: Our Hero

In school, at work, or in your social circle, there are one or two people who stand out. They may not be the best-looking people you know, or the best at what they do. Yet they have an indefinable something—charisma, a magnetism as strong as earth's gravitational attraction to the Sun. They know who they are and who they aren't, and don't feel they have much to prove to anyone else. Others follow them around like a rock star's groupies, basking in reflected glory and hoping for a morsel of personal attention from their hero.

In drama, such people are the heroes of the story, the magnetic protagonists who drive the narrative. And in the story of your life, you are the hero. The Sun in your birth chart indicates the personal style and settings that define your charisma and magnetism. Whenever someone looks up to you, copies what you do or say or how you dress, or lobbies hard for your attention, they're responding to the Sun in you. And when you walk through the world with your head held high, feeling pretty good about yourself, and perhaps with a little strut in your step, you're responding to your sunny side, too.

# The Monster: The Zero

Some are born with a natural ability to celebrate the Sun's energy in their lives. Their dispositions are "sunny," open, and welcoming. But many of us are raised to think that calling attention to ourselves is selfish and unattractive. Where my husband comes from, they call this the "Tall Poppy Syndrome." Sometimes when people feel frustrated in their own lives, they try to "chop down" anyone else who succeeds in standing out from the crowd (the "tall poppy").

If you spent your life among smaller poppies, it might have been difficult for you to develop and embrace "solar" energy in your life—the universal human need for recognition and self-expression.

Nearly every day, I'll bet you encounter someone whose ego is undernourished, frantically lobbying for validation. It may be a tedious party guest who dominates the conversation with talk of himself, who seems, at first glance, to be pretty self-infatuated. But, of course, anyone who has to work that hard to convince you that he's impressive is probably not too sure of himself. And anyone who is jealous of another's success, or has a hard time giving others their due, is probably fairly insecure.

When you find yourself trying too hard to be noticed, showing off and putting on airs, you're a quart low on Sun energy. Understanding the Sun in your chart can help you understand what you can do to feel truly good about yourself—and to cultivate magnetism and an infectious joy for living

## The Sun in Signs and Houses

The Sun's sign in your chart describes the outward style of your inner hero. Does he or she look more like Superman, Gandhi, or Joan of Arc? The Sun's house placement pinpoints the areas of life in which you naturally shine (fighting crime, championing human rights, leading others in battle). This section blends the meanings of the Sun's sign and house placements into 12 parts instead of 24, since the themes of certain signs and houses are similar.

**Astro Tip**

Be sure to read both paragraphs that pertain to the Sun's sign and house placement in your birth chart. And remember that aspects between your Sun and other planets in your chart can also affect the way you experience your inner hero.

## Sun in Aries/first house—The hero:

You feel most "yourself," and are most charismatic, when you're doing something new and going after what you want. The zero: When you find yourself taking foolish risks and picking fights, it may be a sign that you are avoiding going after something that's truly important to you.

# Sun in Taurus/second house

The hero: The Sun shines brightest in you when you're enjoying the pleasures of the material world and creating an atmosphere of stability and security. The zero: Boasting that your possessions are "the best" and that your way of doing things is the only "right" way are signs that you feel insecure or disrespected.

# Sun in Gemini/third house

The hero: You're at your most magnetic when you're telling stories and sharing ideas and information. The zero: If you find yourself talking too much, listening too little, or engaging in destructive gossip, it's a sign you're not feeding your mind with enough variety and stimulation.

# Sun in Cancer/fourth house

The hero: You feel most creative and confident when you're creating a nest of comfort and nurturing for yourself and others. The zero: When you find yourself clinging to what's familiar or feeling that others are taking advantage of you, it's probably time for you to step back and move your own priorities to the top of the list for a while.

# Sun in Leo/fifth house

The hero: You're a charismatic powerhouse when you're expressing yourself through art or by lighting up a party with your joyful sense of play. The zero: When you feel ignored or ordinary, you can become a classic show-off, determined to grab the spotlight at any cost. That's a sign that you need rest and relaxation to fuel your true creativity.

# Sun in Virgo/sixth house

The hero: You're irresistible when you're making the world more manageable; it's fun to watch you at work, doing something you love. The zero: When you feel unappreciated or woefully imperfect, you can become cranky and caustic; that's when it's time to work on something out of love, rather than just to be helpful.

If you don't identify with your Sun sign, it could be that there are other factors in your birth chart that contradict its symbolism. But it could also be that you haven't yet "grown in" to your Sun sign. After all, the Sun symbolizes something we reach for, and we're not necessarily born knowing how to make the most of its gifts!

**Sun in Libra/seventh house**—The hero: When the Sun's energy is strong in you, you're charming, pleasant, and have a gift for making others feel you're just delighted to see them walk through the door. The zero: When you lose sight of what makes you unique and wonderful, you can let yourself get pushed around; that's when it's time to stand up for yourself, in your own charming way.

**Sun in Scorpio/eighth house**—The hero: Your charisma is based in your emotional strength; others feel they can trust you with their deepest secrets. The zero: If you find yourself feeling overburdened or betrayed, you can be caustic and manipulative; let go of what isn't serving you rather than scattering your energies in revenge or bitterness.

**Sun in Sagittarius/ninth house**—The hero: You're most "yourself" when you're sharing your knowledge and embarking on adventures, and others are drawn to your vision and optimism. The zero: If you find yourself giving unsolicited advice, feeling hemmed in, or lacking inspiration, it's time to dream new dreams, get out of your comfort zone, and think bigger for yourself.

**Sun in Capricorn/tenth house**—The hero: Your no-nonsense pragmatism and insistence on excellence are the keys to your charisma; others want to please you and to live up to your example. The zero: If you find that you're neglecting your loved ones in pursuit of worldly goals, it's time to remember the emotional ties that motivate all worthwhile goals.

**Sun in Aquarius/eleventh house**—The hero: You have a gift for making other people feel that they belong; you're the social glue that holds your community together. The zero: When you begin to feel over-committed or that you have no time for yourself, you can become rebellious and erratic. That’s when it’s time to take a hard look at your social commitments and pare them down to just the ones that really mean something to you


# Sun in Pisces/twelfth house—The hero

You're at your most charismatic when you're living in the moment and helping others have fun or feel better, through art, music, comedy, or spiritual pursuits. The zero: If you let yourself become overwhelmed by other people, you can become unreliable and physically ill; it's essential that you develop strong boundaries and to recognize when you need down time to recharge your batteries.

# Your Inner Mom: The Moon

Every mother knows that no matter how good a job she does of protecting her young, the day will eventually come when the offspring leaves the nest and her care. That's why mothers spend the first part of our lives keeping us safe—and most importantly, teaching us how to keep ourselves safe.

The Moon in your chart represents Mom: her story, her personality, her history, and your relationship with her. But it also symbolizes your inner Mom, the one that was installed in your psyche during your formative years. It symbolizes the ways you protect yourself, comfort yourself, and how you take care of others based on how you were cared for. It symbolizes the way you like to live, your nesting instinct, and how connected you feel to your family and the place where you grew up. In the story of your life, the Moon is the matriarch, holding together home and hearth and tending emotional needs, while the patriarch hunts wildebeests and farms the land.

The Moon is symbolically connected to the sign of Cancer, and informs that sign's domesticity and protective instincts. It's also associated with the fourth house of the chart, and shares that house's symbolism of history, family, and sense of place. The Moon is exalted, or especially strong, in the sign of Taurus, which lends stability to the Moon's fluctuations and moods.

It's in its detriment in Capricorn, a sign whose worldliness is at odds with the Moon's domestic nature. And the Moon is in its fall in Scorpio, where it can symbolize suspicion and mistrust.

## Moon Fast Facts

* Key concepts—Comfort, nurturing security, home, family
* Cycle—Takes 28 days to complete a cycle of the zodiac
* Rules—Cancer
* Exalted—Taurus
* Detriment—Capricorn
* Fall—Scorpio
* Glyph—First quarter Moon
* Anatomy—Stomach, breasts, digestion, fluids and glandular secretions, left eye (male), right eye (female)

## The Goddess: Good Mom

The 1950s were the golden age of television mothers, epitomized by Leave it to Beaver's June Cleaver, the quintessential "good mom". Nurturing, supportive, protective, and kind, June maintained an impeccable home, greeted her sons after school with a plate of warm cookies, and prepared sumptuous meals for Beaver, Wally, and their dad, Ward—all while wearing fetching housedresses, pearls, and pumps.

June Cleaver is an unreasonable role model for any mortal woman. But the archetype of a woman who is completely loving and devoted to you alone is a compelling one. After all, there was a time, living in your mother's womb, that you were completely safe and the object of her entire care; it's a state to which part of you longs to return, no matter how old you are. The Moon in chart describes your inner caretaker—the things you do to comfort, nurture, and protect yourself, just as any good mother would do.

# The Monster: Bad Mom

Like the old saying goes, "No one can push your buttons quite like your mother can. After all, she installed them." A mom who doesn't know when to back off, to take off the training wheels and let you ride your bike alone, can feel smothering. And a woman who resents the constraints of motherhood can pass that resentment on to her children.

When your lunar processes run off course, you can become clingy with those you love, overprotective, and a slave to your fears and to your unconscious. Or you may find yourself growing resentful and short-tempered with those who look to you for nurturing and comfort. Taken to extremes, lunar energy run amok becomes Joan Crawford in Mommie Dearest, the ultimate "bad mom." These are signs that you need to be a good mom to yourself and help give yourself the healthy emotional support we all need. The sign and house of the Moon in your chart describe the things you should do to make yourself feel better; astrological chicken soup for the soul, if you will.

# A Mom Never Forgets

Ever wonder why your mom never, ever forgets the rotten things you did when you were a kid? It's simple: the Moon is the astrological symbol that's associated with both mothers and memory.

# The Moon in Signs and Houses

The Moon's sign in your chart describes the outward style of your inner mom. Does she resemble June Cleaver, Roseanne, or Joan Crawford? The Moon's house placement symbolizes the areas of life in which you seek and offer nurturing and emotional connection.

This section blends the meanings of the Moon's sign and house placements into 12 parts instead of 24, since the themes of certain signs and houses are similar.

_Astro Tip_

Be sure to read both paragraphs that pertain to the Moon's sign and house placement in your birth chart. And remember that aspects between the Moon and other planets can also influence the qualities of your inner mom.

## Moon in Taurus/second house

Good mom: A practical, calming Depression Era mom, able to provide necessities and make any situation work, no matter how grim. Bad mom: Rigid and narrow-minded. Nurturing yourself: Emotionally stable, you rarely give in to blue moods. But working outdoors, indulging in creature comforts, and building collections are sources of comfort.

## Moon in Gemini/third house

# Your Inner Sidekick: Mercury
Excited about her latest crush, a fifth-grader urges her friend Becky to do reconnaissance. "Go and find out if he likes me! Tell him I like him!" Becky scurries away, delivers the message, and soon returns with news of requited affection. After a couple more rounds, a summit has been arranged in which the young lovers will meet to plight their troth. Satisfied with a morning's work well done, Becky flits away to report on every detail of her activities to a cluster of interested classmates.

She probably has no idea, but Becky is working for Mercury. The god of communication was in charge of moving information around amongst the other gods; according to some legends, he even transported the dead to the front door of the afterlife. Mercury symbolizes your desire and aptitude for gathering information, getting the message out, and bringing people together. Since Mercury never orbits farther than about 28 degrees from the Sun, I like to think of him as the press agent for your inner superstar, able to broadcast news of your latest adventures, organize interviews with the press, and schedule meetings with influential people.

Mercury is most comfortable in the signs of Gemini, Virgo (rulership), and Aquarius (exaltation). He has a more difficult job expressing himself in Sagittarius and Pisces (detriment), which prefer to focus on the big picture rather than the details and trivia that delight Mercury, and Leo (fall), in which Mercury's perceptions tend to be overly subjective (it won't do for the press agent to believe his own hype).

# Mercury Fast Facts

* Key concepts—Perception, communication, skill
* Cycle—Takes 88 days to complete a cycle of the zodiac
* Rules—Gemini, Virgo
* Exalted—Aquarius
* Detriment—Sagittarius, Pisces
* Fall—Leo
* Glyph—The god Mercury's winged cap
* Anatomy—Hands and arms, respiratory system, hormones, nervous system, brain, sight, mouth, tongue

# The God: The Sidekick

If only life were like the movies (an idea I heartily endorse), each of us would be assigned our own sidekick. A sidekick is a secondary character—usually the lead character's slightly less attractive but witty best friend—who provides comic relief, helps move the story along with a well-timed word in the lead's ear and is the only one who can tell the protagonist that he or she is about to make a big mistake. In some stories, the sidekick is wacky scene stealer; in others, the straight man for the brilliant protagonist, a sort of Dr. Watson to the Sun's Sherlock Holmes.

The Sun in your chart symbolizes your inner superstar, but Mercury describes your inner sidekick. When a situation calls for you to toot your own horn, do you sound like a wisecracking secretary, a self-effacing best friend, or a patient sounding board?

# The Monster: The Mouthpiece

A traitor who reveals state secrets, the neighborhood gossip, or a friend who spreads rumors behind your back are all examples of "Monster" Mercury at work. When Mercury's cleverness and resourcefulness are used for ill, the result can be dishonesty, unreliability, and indiscretion.

What's the motivation for lying, deceit, and double-crossing?
Remember that Mercury always serves the Sun; so when Mercury is up to no good, it's because the ego—the Sun—has malfunctioned. Trading in sensitive information can make you feel important and bolster a wounded ego, but it can damage your credibility in the long run. When your inner hero has turned into a villain, Mercury ceases to function as comic relief and becomes a hapless henchman.

!Astro Alert

Planets or signs in the third house of your chart can strongly influence your style of thinking and communicating. Mercury in Libra combined with Aries or Mars in the third house, for instance, can mask Aries/Mars's iron fist in Libra's velvet glove.

# Mercury in Signs and Houses

Mercury's sign in your chart describes the outward style of your inner sidekick—is your Mercury the zany best friend, the partner in crime, or the court jester? Mercury's house placement symbolizes the areas of life that you find especially interesting, and where you find it easy to gather and share information.

This section blends the meanings of Mercury's sign and house placements into 12 parts instead of 24, since the themes of certain signs and houses are similar.

!Astro Tip

Be sure to read both paragraphs that pertain to Mercury's sign and house placement in your birth chart. And remember that aspects between Mercury and other planets can also influence the qualities of your inner sidekick.

# Mercury in Aries/first house

The sidekick: You're the hot-headed sidekick with the itchy trigger finger, ready to defend the hero with impulsive words and a vocabulary that would make a sailor blush. The mouthpiece: You think fast, but not always wisely, and words are some of your sharpest weapons. Remember the old adage: measure twice, cut once!

# Mercury in Taurus/second house

The sidekick: You're the laconic, patient sidekick who is just plain comfortable to be around. You don't say much, but what you do say is worth listening to (and often said in a beautiful voice); you don't believe in talking when your actions—or gifts—can speak more eloquently. The mouthpiece: You're not much of a talker, so you're not much good at promoting the hero—or yourself. It takes you so long to get to the point that you often forget what you were trying to say.

# Mercury in Gemini/third house

The sidekick: Witty and wisecracking, you're the classic fast-talking, fast-moving sidekick. You have the gift of gab, hatch ingenious schemes, and can think and talk circles around almost anyone. The mouthpiece: The wit that some people find delightful is profoundly annoying to others. Slow down and take a breath once in awhile!

# Mercury in Cancer/fourth house

The sidekick: Tender hearted, sensitive, and fiercely loyal, you're the Melanie Wilkes (Gone With the Wind) of sidekicks. Shy, retiring, and primly old fashioned, you smile timidly, blush easily, and seem altogether harmless—until your inner superhero is threatened, and then your tongue grows claws. The mouthpiece: Sometimes you overthink your emotions; other times you get so emotional that you can't think or talk clearly.

# Mercury in Leo/fifth house

The sidekick: You're the crowd-pleasing sidekick who steals the show—you're just so colorful and charismatic! Every time you open you mouth it's like that old E.F. Hutton commercial: everyone around you stops to listen, because you're a dazzling storyteller. The mouthpiece: Do you ever stop talking about yourself? Self-promotion is all good and well, but give others a chance to discover your charms for themselves!

## Mercury in Virgo/sixth house

The sidekick: You're M*A*S*H's Radar O'Reilly, so attuned to the needs of others that you know what they need before they do. This is one of Mercury's strongest signs, and you're smarter and more capable than most—including your inner superhero, who knows it (and hopefully values you for it). The mouthpiece: You over-analyze, nit-pick, and offer criticism when it wasn't asked for. Now and then, go ahead and throw some money down on the table without calculating the tip to the last penny.

## Mercury in Libra/seventh house

The sidekick: You're the smooth, sweet-talking sidekick who distracts the bad guys while the superhero is doing something sneaky in the background. Like Mercury in Taurus, you have a way of talking that others find enchanting, so much so that they hardly notice what you're saying. The mouthpiece: You make it impossible for people to know where you stand on a matter, can be maddeningly indecisive, and often give too much ground in an argument.

## Mercury in Scorpio/eighth house

The sidekick: You are the quietly strong, intensely loyal sidekick who speaks softly but carries a mighty big stick (with nails in it). The mouthpiece: No one messes with you; you're incredibly perceptive about people's sensitive spots and, when crossed, you don't hesitate to call attention to them. You're not always nice, but you are an effective mouthpiece.

## Mercury in Sagittarius/ninth house

The sidekick: You're the fun-loving, clownish cowboy sidekick, taking comical pratfalls and generally yucking it up. Which makes it all the more surprising when you pipe up with some philosophical word of wisdom. Mercury's not at his best here, but you do have a way of endearing others to you with the naive wisdom of your words. The mouthpiece: You're notoriously gaffe-prone, sticking your foot in your mouth, telling secrets out of school, and being so cheerfully blunt that people want to murder you.

## Mercury in Capricorn/tenth house

The sidekick: You're the stoic, glowering henchman in the pinstripe suit who pays off prospective suitors of poor rank. Highly strategic and a pragmatist, you're an asset to any superhero. The mouthpiece: It can be disturbingly easy for you to excise all human emotion from your decisions, and to lock up enemies below deck while your inner superhero takes over the ship.

## Mercury in Aquarius/eleventh house

The sidekick: You're the crazy inventor/professor, not unlike Doc Brown in the Back to the Future movies. You're an innovative thinker, so much so that people often think you're a little bit bonkers. The mouthpiece: You're extremely opinionated, and you are probably a little bit bonkers. It's not a great combination.

## Mercury in Pisces/twelfth house

The sidekick: You're either a ghostly sidekick or the sweet, harmless girl or boy next door. Exceptionally empathetic, you have a genius for speaking to others on their level, using their language; you get on their wavelength and voice their thoughts. You don't always think or speak in a straight line, but nevertheless your insights often save the day. The mouthpiece: You speak in endless circles about your mantra, your guru, and your poetry. Sometimes, you burst into song. This is no way to get your inner superhero taken seriously.

# Your Inner Consort: Venus

What makes you feel good? What kinds of people do you find attractive? Why do you collect the things you do—ticket stubs, marbles, glass figurines, stocks and bonds? What's your relationship with money? Venus, the traditional planet of money and relationships, is best thought of as the planet of pleasure. Venus in your chart describes what you truly enjoy, what you find attractive, what you are willing to spend money on, and how you adorn, treat, and pamper yourself. Venus is also considered the relationship planet, though that's a bit simplistic. Really, every planet is a relationship planet; but Venus symbolizes the pleasure and affection of relationships, the factor and attraction that draws us in. Even someone who married for money is marrying for Venus, since Venus is also the goddess of money. Venus is happiest in the signs of her rulership, Taurus and Libra, where she feels prosperous and pretty, and loving Pisces, the sign of her exaltation. She has a harder time expressing beauty and harmony in the tough-edged signs of Scorpio and Aries (detriment) and in analytical Virgo (fall).

## Venus Fast Facts

* Key concepts—Desires, values, finances, partners
* Cycle—Takes 224½ days to complete a cycle of the zodiac
* Rules—Taurus, Libra
* Exalted—Pisces
* Detriment—Aries, Scorpio
* Fall—Virgo
* Glyph—Venus's mirror
* Anatomy—Throat, cheeks, sense of taste, kidneys, ovaries, internal reproductive organs, venous blood circulation, skin's sensory organs

# The Goddess: Beauty

Venus-filled people have a gift of making others feel good. It may be physical beauty and grace, artistic talent, or simply an honestly affectionate and happy nature that makes them so popular. But usually, it's the fact that they demonstrate an honest interest in you. They ask questions about you, and actually listen to your reply without jumping in with stories of their own. They laugh at your jokes, and the laughter is sincere. They say nice things about other people behind their backs. They're gracious in the face of compliments or praise of their own virtues. And yet they also give the impression—by their own aura of healthy self-esteem—of being people whose esteem is worth having.

You have the capacity to be such a person, by understanding and honoring your own Venus gifts and beauty and by learning to find beauty in others.

Imagine a creature that's physically beautiful but so vain, selfish, promiscuous, spoiled, and wasteful that its physical gifts are wasted. In fact, you need journey no further than your supermarket checkout line to find stories about vapid, pampered starlets and heiresses whose only claim to fame is wealth or beauty.

But even regular folks can be pretty unpleasant, even with far less money and fame than People's last cover model. No one likes a whiner, or someone who barely tolerates your presence as she preens in a mirror or as he looks over your shoulder in the hope of finding someone more interesting. The moocher, the freeloader, the gigolo, the "kept woman" are looked down upon, for they've exchanged their beauty and grace for mere money.

Venus is the planet of love and relationships. This is because relationships, at their best, unite us with partners who complement us. But it's also because relationships are expected to enrich us and make us feel good.

# Venus in Signs and Houses

Venus's sign describes the outward style of your inner consort. Venus in houses pinpoints the areas of life in which you find pleasure and beauty in yourself, your environment, and in others.

For the sake of space, I'm blending 24 paragraphs into 12.

!Astro Tip

Be sure to read both paragraphs that pertain to Venus' sign and house placement in your birth chart. And remember that aspects between Venus and other planets can also influence the qualities of your inner consort.

## Venus in Aries/first house

Beauty: You find pleasure in battle, challenges, and physicality. You make others feel good about their physical appearance, assertiveness, and ability to defend themselves. Beast: Spends impulsively, over-idealistic in love, demanding.

## Venus in Taurus/second house

Beauty: You find pleasure in whatever appeals to your senses. You spend money on art, music, and creature comforts. You make others feel good by giving them a massage or singing for them. Beast: Possessive, materialistic, and self-indulgent.

## Venus in Gemini/third house

Beauty: You find pleasure in words, thoughts, variety, and wit. You spend money on books and cars. You make others feel good by making them laugh or talking to them. Beast: Empty-headed, shallow, gossipy.

## Venus in Cancer/fourth house
