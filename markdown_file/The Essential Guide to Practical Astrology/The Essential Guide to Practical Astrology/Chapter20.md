Mars and the cycle of assertiveness
Jupiter and the cycle of exploration
Saturn and the cycle of authority
Solar and lunar eclipses

Each year, around about Thanksgiving time, I begin to mull over the prospect of writing a holiday newsletter to send to our family and friends. Yes: I'm one of "those people." On the other hand, as my friends and family will attest, I write really cool holiday newsletters. That's because I only include the highlights of the year. If the year didn't have any particular highlights (some years are like that), I make the mundane stuff super interesting. And if I can't do that, I don't send out a newsletter.

What makes an event worthy of the holiday newsletter? First, I have to be able to remember it in late November. Someone in the household broke a leg or built a coffee roaster from scratch? Check. We took a vacation to some exotic location, or someone graduated from school? Check. Groundbreaking career achievements? You bet.

The cycles of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and the tension of semiannual solar and lunar eclipses, indicate life experiences that are generally interesting enough to fill a family holiday newsletter and not put your audience to sleep. Mars covers half the zodiac in a year, energizing fully half of the areas of your life with scrappy, feisty goodness. Jupiter covers a full sign of the zodiac, bringing the opportunity for at least one really interesting adventure. And Saturn pokes along through one half of a sign, so within any given year you're probably sizing up your ambitions in some area of your life or else your ship is in the process of coming in, with a cargo of either rewards or disappointments. (Don't put the disappointments in the newsletter, unless you can make them funny.)

# Mars: Cycles of Assertiveness

Mars is the planet of assertiveness, symbolizing where in life you tend to be an assertive and proactive hunter (or, heaven forbid, a bully), and where you're inclined to hide under the furniture like prey. Unlike Mercury and Venus, which are never farther away from the Sun than 28 and 45 degrees respectively, Mars can make every possible aspect to the Sun. So in the Mars principle, the Sun—your ego and sense of identity—encounter, for the first time, real friction and the potential of open warfare with others. A toddler discovers the word "no" around the time Mars first returns to its natal position at age 2½, standing up for the first time to his parents, the gods of his young life. Likewise, you might find that 2½ years into a job, a relationship, or any other kind of undertaking, that you just feel done with it, and itchy to move on.

Mars represents your desire for newness and challenges. After 2½ years, Mars has made a full circuit of the signs and houses from where it started. You've experienced everything at least twice—anniversaries, birthdays, annual reports, shareholder meetings—and it's time for a new challenge.

About every two-and-a-half years, Mars returns to the same degree and sign it was in at your birth. This is your "Mars Return," and marks the beginning of a new two-and-a-half-year cycle of work, physical exertion, and challenges. It's often a time when you feel restless, bored, and ready for a fresh start.

# Mars in Motion

As it moves through the zodiac, Mars indicates the nature of the challenges and conflicts that all of us face at the same time. Situations and types of people suggested by the sign through which Mars is moving tend to be energized, sexually charged, competitive, impulsive, and quick to anger under Mars's influence.

The areas of your particular life where you are energized and ready to resolve conflict are indicated by Mars's placement in the houses of your chart. About half the houses in your chart will be energized by Mars this year and the rest next year. Because not all houses are the same size, Mars may spend more time in one house than another.

## Mars moving through Aries/your first house

A strong sign for Mars, so energy flows smoothly. This is a great time to begin all new projects, especially exercise routines, competitive enterprises, and jobs, especially entrepreneurial enterprises. Go after your individual goals. Don't completely forget about other people's needs and feelings, of course; but there are times in life when it's essential to focus on yourself, and this is one of those times. However, aggression is given its head. This is a time when wars begin, arguments flare up, and conflicts about territory and leadership come to a head.

## Mars moving through Taurus/your second house

Taurus is not a strong sign for Mars, and energy here tends to move very slowly, with a lot of waiting and frustration. On the plus side, people make well-considered decisions. Pursue what you need to get where you want to go. Actively cultivate sources of income and stockpile provisions. However, there's a tendency to eat and spend impulsively, and conflicts may erupt over money or other resources.

## Mars moving through Gemini/your third house

Energy is scattered and people are prone to restlessness and irritation. It's a great time to clear the air and really speak your mind about what's bothering you, and it's also a great time to initiate new communication businesses or routines. Speak your mind. Work with your hands. Write something. Begin learning a new language or skill. Fights among neighbors, siblings, and others in a shared community are common, and people may tend to drive aggressively or pick fights.

# Mars moving through Cancer/your fourth house

A great time to do work around the house, especially renovation and in particular work that you do yourself. Spending time at home or with family can energize you now; if there are conflicts to be resolved, now is the time to tackle them. Expend physical energy at home, whether exercising, working on your home, or doing your job from home. Begin projects or businesses related to domestic or women's issues, or concerning nutrition or food. Conflicts within families or nations—the source of which are usually related to security—come to a head.

# Mars moving through Leo/your fifth house

Assert yourself creatively; go after fun and attention! Conflicts at this time emerge over who should get attention and recognition, about child-rearing, and about sex. You want to have fun and you want to be noticed and admired. Give some energy to a hobby or some creative pastime that really makes you happy. Spend active time with your kids.

# Mars moving through Virgo/your sixth house

A very strong time for research, analysis, problem solving, and practical solutions. Really push yourself at work right now; you've got the energy for it. You may find yourself competing at work, for a raise or for some other kind of reward; in any event, your competitive instincts are driving you at work now. You want to work alone. Handle anger well or you may become ill. Those around you are prone to nervousness and irritability; fights erupt over critical attitudes or work that isn't done well. It can also be a challenging time for health, but also a good time to change health attitudes and routines.

# Mars moving through Libra/your seventh house

A good time to plot strategies and figure out ways to persuade others to give you what you want. Start a marketing or PR campaign or business. This can be a tough couple of months, because Mars requires that we assert ourselves, while Libra and the seventh house emphasize cooperation with others. You may find yourself in a series of difficult confrontations with people close to you.

Moods vacillate between anger and conciliation; fights break out within primary relationships, and the underlying issue is about fairness.

**Mars moving through the seventh house of your chart** doesn't have to mean a fiery end to your most important relationships! But it's an important time for both you and your partner to be able to air your disagreements openly (and loudly, if that's your style). This will give you a better chance for a more honest relationship moving forward, one that honors each individual personality.

**Mars moving through Scorpio/your eighth house** —A strong sign for Mars, so energy flows well. This is the time to confront systemic, deep-rooted problems, including emotional and psychological blockages. A good time to engage in therapy. Also a good time for sleuthing and for core problem solving. Conflicts emerge about jealousy, suspicion, betrayal, lack of trust, and how to best use shared resources. You will tend to fight with your most intimate partners, but that can be pretty exciting for your sex life. It's a good time to work out investment strategies, catch up on your bookkeeping, and organize your wills and trusts.

**Mars moving through Sagittarius/your ninth house** —Energy is generally upbeat and abundant, and this is a great time to take a leap of faith. New experiences and adventure are the buzzwords; start a business or other project that helps people expand their minds, bodies, or spirits. It's a great time to start a higher education program, or to write a thesis, dissertation, or book. You'll enjoy spending time outdoors, and will be eager to travel. Legal conflicts and issues around religion, beliefs, and institutions (especially education) are likely to come to a critical point now. Conflicts related to religion, school, or travel.

**Mars moving through Capricorn/your tenth house** —One of Mars's best signs, so energy is highly focused, disciplined, and productive. Now is the time to lay foundations for the future, establish goals, and formulate business or life plans. Mars in your tenth house is one of the peaks of your Mars cycle; make the most of it by asserting yourself in your career. You may have conflicts with those in positions of authority. Conflicts emerge around who's in charge, and about rules, structure, and discipline.

## Mars moving through Aquarius/your eleventh house

Energy is at a consistent level but given to sudden changes in direction. It's a good time to initiate a group or organization or something requiring a team effort. Assert yourself with your friends, or pursue a leadership role in an organization to which you belong. It's a good time for you to work with other people, even if you normally prefer to work on your own. Conflicts arise around the issue of equality, with friends and members of organizations ripe for confrontation.

## Mars moving through Pisces/your twelfth house

Energy is flowing now, but does not work well if it's forced into rigid routines and particular directions. Live in the moment, and pursue musical, artistic, or spiritual goals. You'd love to sleep, rest, and give yourself over to dream states, long naps, and woolgathering. If you don't have the luxury of doing that, work hard to access your imagination and sensitivity and use them in your work. Conflicts emerge about unreliability, deception, unrealistic ideas, or faith; resist the urge to run from conflict.

In Chinese astrology, the 12-year cycle of animal signs originated with the orbit of Jupiter, which takes about 12 years to make an orbit around the Sun.

# Jupiter: Cycles of Exploration

Jupiter symbolizes everything large, including the ways we grow in consciousness, body, and spirit. When Jupiter touches a sign, he brings a call to adventure to those parts of the human experience; when he moves through a house of your birth chart, you become like Alice in Wonderland after she at that piece of cake and grew so large that she became trapped in the White Rabbit's house.

Astrologers don't necessarily believe that Jupiter is Santa Claus, but his movement through the chart does seem to coincide with times of opportunity, adventure, and growth. Jupiter asks, "Where have you outgrown your current life?" Where are you ready for an adventure, and a new way of looking at things, and what kind of experiences will help you get them?

## Jupiter in Motion

As Jupiter moves through the signs of the zodiac, all of us experience the potential for growth in the areas of life represented by Jupiter's current sign. If mankind at large ignores the opportunity for growth, giving into intellectual laziness and arrogance, we lose the opportunity for this particular adventure for another 12 years.

Jupiter moving through the houses of your chart make the impulse for growth and adventure specific to you and your life. Look back 12 years ago, when Jupiter was in the same sign and house, for clues to how to make most of this cycle. The signs and houses share a lot of common territory, so I've combined the signs and equivalent houses in the interpretations that follow. But be sure to read both Jupiter's sign and the house of your chart that it's moving through.

**Jupiter moving through Aries/your first house** -It's time to upgrade your personality and outlook to something a little more inclusive and exuberant, more in line with your beliefs. Have the courage of your convictions; walk it like you talk it. This is the year you take up a new sport, do something dramatic about your appearance, go on a strenuously physical adventure, or start pursuing an educational goal.

# Jupiter moving through Taurus/your second house

Put your money where your mouth is. Invest in your dreams; be generous with yourself and with others. Step out of your comfort zone. Learn more about money, appraisal, or property; don't be afraid to spend money on education.

# Jupiter moving through Gemini/your third house

Think bigger. Learn a new language. Read lots of books, and try your hand at writing. Get to know your neighbors. You might not be able to get away for a long vacation to a distant land, but try to get a change of scenery on a regular basis, even if it's just going to a restaurant you haven't tried before.

# Jupiter moving through Cancer/your fourth house

Expand your base of operations. This could mean moving to a new house or enlarging the one you have; it could mean adding members to your household—kids, extended family, new pets. Cook large meals, or experiment with new types of food. If you're traveling, you'll probably enjoy visiting family or returning to your home town. You'll enjoy learning about things related to family, so you might embark on a genealogy project.

# Jupiter moving through Leo/your fifth house

This year you discover that you've a lot more creative than you thought, and will probably enjoy putting yourself forward and getting attention, even if you're normally more retiring. That's cool; express yourself! Take an art class, or tour the great museums of the world (or even just the ones in your city). Be a teacher or mentor to young people, especially in the areas of sports or the arts.

# Jupiter moving through Virgo/your sixth house

This year, you need a bigger job to do. Maybe it's time to change where you work, whether your employer or even your industry; maybe you just need to find a way to bring more of yourself, and your philosophy of life, to the work you're doing. Bring a little something new into your life every day.

# Jupiter moving through Libra/your seventh house

This is a year when it's important to connect with people who help you see the world, and your place in it, in a bigger way. Perhaps your expectations about relationships have been too small; maybe you have been afraid to hope and reach for everything you want.

# Jupiter moving through the houses

Jupiter moving through Scorpio/your eighth house — Unless you win the lottery or have a really interesting selection of people on your holiday mailing list, the big news this year will probably not end up in a newsletter. This is quieter, more private stuff, like learning to trust others and accepting their support. Like making a real intimate soul connection with someone, or learning to accept something about yourself that's always bothered you.

Jupiter moving through Sagittarius/your ninth house — You know what? You don't know as much as you think you do. The good news is, there's always more to learn, someplace new you haven't visited, and new dreams and visions to embrace. Enlarge your vision this year; look for experiences that challenge your beliefs.

Jupiter moving through Capricorn/your tenth house — This year, you'll find you're ready to be a leader, or at least to acknowledge your expertise in a particular area. You may even be ready for parenthood! Be willing to invest hope and money into a business venture, whether your own or someone else's, one you really believe in. Follow your calling, with your whole heart, and take a chance in your career that you've never before been ready to take.

Jupiter moving through Aquarius/your eleventh house — Some of the people you call your friends are no longer moving in the same direction that you are. Look for new companions in previously unexplored places. This year you envision a long-term goal that you may not reach for a while; let yourself commit to it and have faith that you'll get there eventually!

Jupiter moving through Pisces/your twelfth house — Your burdens have become much too heavy and take up far too much space in your life. This year tie a bunch of helium balloons to them, and release them into the wild.

Open up space for relaxation, for rest, and for daydreaming. Explore the fertile pastures of your imagination; write a song or a poem, or paint a mural on your bedroom wall.

## Misc.

## Lucky Jupiter

In traditional astrology, Jupiter was called the Greater Benefic. It was considered the most positive and fortunate of all the planets, and its placement and influence in the birth chart a symbol of protection, luck, and happiness.

## Saturn: Cycles of Authority

Saturn takes 29½ years to complete a journey around the Sun. It spends about 2½ years in each sign of the zodiac. As Saturn moves through the zodiac, society experiences burdens, blockages, challenges, and hardship in the matters related to each sign. If your Sun, Moon, or Ascendant are in the sign Saturn is currently moving through, these hardships take on a more personal relevance. And as Saturn takes its 29½-year trip around the houses of your horoscope, it represents the maturity, wisdom, and self-discipline that come with confronting, working through, and achieving authority and mastery in those areas of your life.

## Saturn in Motion

This year, you need to feel as though you're within a year or two of reaching an important goal related to Saturn's current sign and its house position in your chart. Saturn represents your ambitions and your willingness to invest hard work and sacrifice in achieving them. His sign and house in your chart describe the nature of your ambitions. Work hard and apply yourself, and Saturn will reward you with self-respect and the respect of others; fail to do your best, and Saturn becomes a harsh parent who lets you know he is very, very disappointed in you.

# Saturn moving through Aries/your first house

If you've dreamed of living alone, working for yourself, or just learning to be comfortable eating in a restaurant by yourself, this is the year to make it happen. It won't be easy; in fact, anything that is easy for you this year is not moving you toward greater independence and self-respect.

# Saturn moving through Taurus/your second house

If you cherish some financial goal, whether getting out of debt, achieving a certain level in your savings account, or maybe putting together a down payment for a house, this is the year to work toward that goal. Any obstacles or difficulties in reaching your goal will prove to you that you're able to take care of yourself.

# Saturn moving through Gemini/your third house

If you want to be listened to, want to be a person whose words have authority and influence, want to write a book or master a new skill, this is your year. People who don't listen to you or who don't appreciate your skill are encouraging you to improve and respect your own abilities and efforts.

# Saturn moving through Cancer/your fourth house

If you want to be closer to your family, to have a better home, or to feel more emotionally secure, this is the year to work on those things. Unable to rely on old foundations, this is a time to begin building a new emotional, financial, and literal home that will protect and sustain you for the next 29 years.

# Saturn moving through Leo/your fifth house

Unable to connect easily with joy, fun, or creativity, you must develop a framework to let you rediscover and explore these areas of your life. Pursue something that offers joy but also requires a commitment of time and discipline—learning to play an instrument, perhaps, or having a child.

# Saturn moving through Virgo/your sixth house

You may have become aware that you lack particular qualifications or technical skills that would allow you to advance in your work; now is the time to work to develop them, and it will almost certainly require sacrifice and determination on your part. Don’t let yourself off the hook; you really need these qualifications or skills to succeed in the next phase of your life.

# Saturn moving through Libra/your seventh house

What kind of partner do you want to have? Are you a person of integrity, discipline, and maturity? Do you deserve to have the kind of partner you want? If not, this is the time to make yourself a better partner. If your relationships aren't working, find where you're lacking instead of looking for faults in your partner. At the end of it all, you may or may not have the relationship you want with another person, but without a doubt you'll have a better relationship with yourself.

# Astro Tip

Particularly important years are the ones when Saturn is moving through your first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house; when it is in the same sign it occupied at your birth; or when it is in the same sign as the Sun or Moon in your birth chart. These are years when you may meet unusually difficult obstacles, discouragement, or hard work; but they are also years that offer the greatest opportunities for maturity and achievement.

# Saturn moving through Scorpio/your eighth house

One of the hardest feelings in life is the feeling that you're completely on your own, with no one to offer assistance. That's how it may feel to you now, and it may be hard for you to imagine that Saturn isn't just trying to make your life miserable. But Saturn wants you to experience the pride and satisfaction that come with being completely self-sufficient—both financially and emotionally. Address your finances realistically, especially loans and investments. And if you need emotional support, this is an excellent time to consider counseling or therapy.

# Saturn moving through Sagittarius/your ninth house

You'd like to be seen as an authority when it comes to life's big questions—the meaning of life, what happens after we die, the way things work. Take your mind seriously. Finish or go back to school, read great works of literature, travel someplace that really challenges you. Real achievement for you will be proving not that you know everything, but rather that you're serious about training your mind and doing the work to become even more knowledgeable.

# Saturn moving through Capricorn/your tenth house
In order to be taken seriously in your career, you need to take yourself, and your professional development, seriously. It's time to acknowledge your own authority and appreciate your achievements; if there are gaps in your ability or flaws in your character, correct them. If the world seems to be pushing you down, keep getting back up and prove that you're worth looking up to.

# Saturn moving through Aquarius/your eleventh house
Some day when your gone, what would you like to be your legacy? What would you like to see written on your tombstone, what tributes in your eulogy? Now is the time to envision and formulate a goal to create this legacy. Enlist your friends to help you; a legacy is always something that's more important than any single person.

# Saturn moving through Pisces/your twelfth house
We've all made mistakes, all had bad things done to us, hurt other people, failed to live up to our potential. The question for you this year is, will you run away from these things, or can you do the work of shoring up your spiritual center? Can you take responsibility for what's gone wrong in your life up to now, forgive others and yourself? Or will you surrender to blame, victimhood, illness, and powerlessness?

# Turning Points
We think of eclipses as incredibly rare and awesome events; in reality, solar eclipses happen twice each year. You may not see them where you live, but that doesn't mean they are happening, and it doesn't mean you're not experiencing their symbolism in your life. Eclipses indicate turning points in your life; just as ancient people feared eclipses because they seemed to suspend the very laws of nature, eclipses in your life can indicate times when things seem to be turned upside down—and that can be scary.

Solar eclipses happen twice each year, when the New Moon happens within 18 degrees of one of the lunar nodes. A lunar eclipse usually occurs within two weeks of a solar eclipse. Because they're associated with the lunar nodes, eclipses have an approximate 18½-year cycle through the zodiac. So if an eclipse falls at the same degree and sign of the Moon in your birth chart at age 10, an other one will fall in roughly that same spot around age 18 or 19. Think back to that really big event in your life, and then flip the calendar forward nine years—what issues were demanding your utmost attention? What about 18½ years later?

As they move through the houses of the horoscope, eclipses show you where the action is: where you are changing, growing, muddling through unfamiliar territory—in short, where you are currently most interesting.

## Eclipse Cycles

The 18½-year cycle of solar eclipses is called the Saros Cycle. This cycle can predict when eclipses will occur in particular areas of the zodiac. Solar eclipses also belong to the Saros Series, which can take hundreds of years to complete. In her book *Predictive Astrology: The Eagle and the Lark* (see Appendix C), astrologer Bernadette Brady has done fascinating work with these cycles, interpreting eclipses according to the "birth" chart for first eclipse in their Saros Series.

## Solar Eclipses

At the solar eclipse, intuition (the Moon), wordless and irrational, overpowers your creative center and power (the Sun). The result is a bit like a short circuit of your internal wiring.

During an eclipse, the fundamental laws of the universe no longer apply.
The Sun browns out, like a faulty wire that dims your kitchen light when you turn on the garbage disposal. The birds turn quiet. The world is shrouded in an apprehensive silence that you can almost hear.

In my observation, the week before and after a solar eclipse has us tiptoeing nervously through the graveyard, whistling a tune to keep the boogeyman away. Solar eclipses seem much more physically affecting than lunar ones, more unnerving, and the past themes they evoke—themes from 9 and 18 years ago—are anything but subtle. They are big events, and evoke the feeling that something big is changing in the landscape of your life.

At the solar eclipse, something is trying to get your attention—like the Moon, rising up in front of the Sun as if to say, "Just hold it a second—you're missing something!" People from the past or the present appear on the scene to behave in inexplicable ways. The person you used to be, the one you thought you'd outgrown, is trotted out in front of you as a reminder that you really haven't changed all that much; you're still the same old mess you were, back when you had the bad relationship, when you flunked out of school, when your best friend told you to get lost. Sit at the knee of the wise Moon, looming larger than usual in the sky, and know that she is reflecting the Sun in you. What is the part of your ego that is running around unchecked? What is the part of you that you're trying to disown? Let the Moon guide you, like a wise mother, toward self-acceptance and humility.

# Lunar Eclipses

During a lunar eclipse, the Earth casts a shadow on the Moon, blocking it from reflecting the Sun's light. Similarly, at a lunar eclipse our ability to transmit and receive light—to channel and midwife divine inspiration—is trumped by the impulses of pure worldliness. Sometimes, it's the worldliness of physical disease or limitation that casts a long shadow; other times, the pain of earthly need and loss.

Usually, it's a pain you recognize. Eclipses have 18-year cycles, so an eclipse falls in the same sign and the same part of your chart every 18 years, and in the opposite spot every 9 years or so. What happens on the outside, in your outer life, is a little different each time—but the thing that's touched inside of you is exactly the same. At the lunar eclipse, an antidote to these earthly difficulties seems to lie in the celebration of earth's healing, stabilizing powers.

At the lunar eclipse, your vision is clear—or at least, you are guided by keen instinct; not the wild, emotional intuition of the Moon, but rather the quiet instincts of the earth. They are the same instincts that guide the hand of the craftsman as it chooses just the right piece of wood for his project; as it hovers for a moment over one chisel, before selecting another that's just right for the task.

At the lunar eclipse, there is something in you that longs to connect more deeply with the earth, to drink from her cool waters and lay your head upon her sweet grass. Some long-ago pain has reared up and sent you packing, returning home to mother earth for solace. As you gaze up at the half-bitten Moon, know that the earth is offering you something, some smooth block of marble, a piece of wood, a section of clay. Open your instinctive mind, and ask yourself: What is it that wants to be brought into being? And what is the right tool with which to carve it out?

# Eclipses in Signs and Through the Houses

Like the lunar nodes, eclipses move clockwise through your chart, falling into opposite signs for a year and a half at a time and moving through opposite houses in your chart. The pattern goes like this:

first house/seventh house
twelfth house/sixth house
eleventh house/fifth house
tenth house/fourth house
ninth house/third house
eighth house/second house

The sizes of these house pairs, or axes, vary depending upon where you were born.
For instance, people born extremely north or south of the equator will have one or two of these axes that are extremely large, while the rest of the houses of the chart are very small. Obviously, as eclipses move through your chart, they will pass more quickly through a very small pair of houses than through a very large one. On average, though, you can count on a particular set of houses in your chart being sensitized by eclipses for one to two years at a time.

# Eclipses in Aries/Libra or the first/seventh houses

Eclipses falling in the first and seventh houses symbolize a time of profound changes in the balance between your individuality and your relationships with others. Romantic relationships, marriages, business partnerships—all take on heightened significance under this influence. Even when the state of your relationships is such a shambles that any change might seem welcome, you're rarely prepared for the anxiety that new relationships, even (or maybe especially) the happiest ones, inspire—anxiety that the "I" will not survive the process of becoming a "we," anxiety that the dream won't last. These are usually active times in your life, when there's a sense of being at war for the survival of your personal identity; be sure to take time out from "relating" to take care of your own needs. On the other hand, you may be getting out of a relationship and rediscovering yourself—falling in love with yourself, so to speak. If so, be careful not to become overly self-absorbed; make time to nurture the positive relationships in your life.

# Eclipses in Virgo/Pisces or the sixth/twelfth houses

After the hectic activity of eclipses moving through your first house, this is a time of recuperation and healing. If you've pushed too hard with eclipses in your first house, this may be a time when you become sick or otherwise find yourself in a position of having to rely on others—or on faith. If you started or ended a relationship while eclipses were moving through your seventh house, this is the time when you must learn to live with the day-to-day consequences of that decision.

It's not uncommon to experience health problems and work upheavals during this cycle, but the real challenge lies in acknowledging your craving for solitary contemplation while simultaneously engaging in life-sustaining activities (work, household maintenance). Ideally, you will learn to immerse yourself in work as a kind of spiritual journey, instead of envisioning your spiritual journey as something that occurs in a vacuum, apart from the everyday world.

## Eclipses in Leo/Aquarius or the fifth/eleventh houses

During the previous eclipse cycle, you passed through the quiet, recuperative stage of eclipses in the twelfth house. This year, it's time to get out and beat the bushes, in search of new friends and connections. With eclipses in the eleventh and fifth houses, love affairs and friendships often get a thrashing—love affairs break up, or an important but temporal relationship passes through your life for a short time. Such relationships have a feeling of "fatedness" about them, and may leave you feeling disillusioned, until you come to a better understanding of the role such relationships play in your life. Often, they serve simply to help you learn how to love better, but not necessarily to stay forever and be your life partner.

Friendships, too, go through big changes. During this cycle, it may seem that everyone deserts you at once; friends may get married or have children and have no time for you, leaving you with little audience for your self-expression. The lesson: do you give of yourself only to please an audience, or because it pleases you to express yourself?

This cycle may correspond to a change in your relationship with your parents or other mentors that allows you to transition to complete adulthood and leaves you feeling more free to express yourself completely and live your life exactly as you please. Also, since the fifth house rules children, eclipses in this house may find you considering the ultimate act of self-expression: becoming a parent.

## Eclipses in Cancer/Capricorn or the fourth/tenth houses

Having gained confidence in your coping mechanisms and creative energy while eclipses moved through the eleventh and fifth houses, you face a new challenge: breaking with the past and moving with confidence toward the future. You might move to a new place, or discover your life's path; one may lead to the other. The key to discovering your direction in life (as described by the tenth house) is in first making peace with your point of origin, and especially with your family. If you are going to get anywhere in life, you must travel as lightly as possible, and that means the family baggage has got to go!

Alternately, if you've spent years pursuing your career path, this may be a time when more emphasis is placed on family. The tenth house sends you out into the world to follow your calling, and the fourth house sends you on a treasure hunt deep within yourself, examining your background and heritage. Here, you find the raw material, diamonds in the rough, that you can polish and refine into a meaningful gift to offer the world.

# Eclipses in Gemini/Sagittarius or the third/ninth houses

Having made decisions about your life's purpose and making peace with the past while eclipses were in the tenth and fourth houses, it's now time to embark upon your quest. Probably, you won't feel up to the challenge; you'll doubt that you have the skills, intellect, or preparation to move forward on your journey. Schooling may become an issue, usually because you're confronted with the educational requirements of pursuing your life's work. You may return to school, or apply for a license or credential you've needed for a long time. You may develop an intense interest in a new subject, or take an existing interest to a new, journeyman level. This is also a typical cycle for leaving an unsatisfying career and starting your own business.

No matter where you are on your path, eclipses in the third and ninth houses mark a time to stretch your consciousness, expand your mental limitations, and test your faith in yourself. Eclipses in the ninth house invite you to take a chance in life, to act on faith, even though you may feel you are not up to the challenge; they also provide the impulse to develop the skills necessary to assist you on your quest.

# Eclipses in Taurus/Scorpio or the second/eighth houses

Having made a daring leap of faith while eclipses were in the ninth house, you begin to wonder if the universe will support you, both emotionally and financially, in your quest. While eclipses fell in your third and ninth houses, you expanded your mind and consciousness; often, with eclipses in the second and eighth houses, you will turn to some kind of therapy or other intense, self-defining process, in an attempt to integrate your new concept of yourself.

The questions you may ask yourself during this cycle are among the most fundamental: who am I really, and is that of any intrinsic value? What's important in life? Usually you'll experience some level of psychological discomfort as you're tested in your resolve to pursue your dream, or experience loss in your life. And this cycle also tends to introduce financial discomfort, because money has a lot to do with how secure we feel about ourselves; working through financial difficulties clarifies what's really important about you, apart from your bank balance.
