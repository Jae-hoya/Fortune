## Long-Range Planner
### Working with Uranus's cycles of awakening and rebellion
### Gaining clarity during Neptune's cycles of enlightenment
### Using Pluto's transformative cycles to gain insight, strength, and confidence

When you're young, you think that you and your experiences are utterly unique. No one ever thought like you, because if they did, they wouldn't be living lives of quiet desperation, working for The Man and combing their hair over their bald spot. I hope you enjoyed that part of your life. (And if you're there now—say, younger than 29—enjoy these feelings of invincibility and moral rectitude! Because generally speaking, they don't last.)

The good news is, the older you get, the more you draw comfort from knowing that, in fact, almost everyone has gone through most of the stuff you have. And if you learn astrology, you begin to understand that we go through an awful lot of it at roughly the same ages. This long-range planner looks at the cycles of the slow-moving planets, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Their cycles form gradually and unfold over a matter of years; the processes they describe are deep and gradual, like subjects you grasp over the course of your academic career. The math you learned in second grade is vastly different than the advanced calculus you mastered in high school. But you didn't get from addition to calculus overnight—it took you 10 years.

Using the information in this cycle, you can prepare for moments of your life when rebellion is likely to flare up, and those times that you're apt to be disillusioned or to feel like life is meaningless. These can be miserable times, but they're part of being human. And by planning ahead for them, you can be an astro-ninja, using the force of these planetary transitions for your own development instead of becoming planetary road kill.

# Uranus: Cycles of Rebellion

Uranus is the planet that symbolizes rebellion against strictures, structures, and rules. It breaks the rules by having three different pronunciations of its name and by rotating on its side, like a rotisserie chicken. Uranus is weird, and he represents the uncivilized weirdo in each one of us.

Uranus takes 84 years to make a complete journey around the Sun. You read that right: 84 long, crazy years. It aspects its position in your birth chart every seven years or so, about the same time Saturn hits a rough patch in its 29½-year cycle. (Seven-year itch, anyone?) Between Saturn pressuring us to master the rules and Uranus urging us to break them, it's no wonder we go a little crazy at ages 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and so on.

Uranus symbolizes that part of you that absolutely can't stand to be told what to do, and his cycle is designed to feed healthy rebellion. It's a good thing to be an independent person, to think for yourself and question conventional wisdom. Rebelling is a good and necessary thing; it keeps society from becoming too rigid and authoritarian. The generation that shares your Uranus sign (see Chapter 14) serves to shake up and challenge a particular set of limiting societal rules; but as Uranus moves through the houses of your horoscope, it also signifies where you are an individual change agent and iconoclast.

The ages of 21, 42, 63, and 84 are among the most pivotal years in your lifetime's Uranus cycle. These are ages when you're likely to feel rebellious and to go a little crazy, making sudden, radical changes in your life.

# Working with the Cycle
How well do you answer Uranus's call for independence? Do you fear real change and lash out with inconsequential rebelliousness, or do you accept the challenge to stand up for unpopular opinions and say no to expectations and conventions that feel oppressive to you?

Track this cycle in your own life. Beginning with your birth, think about the following ages and how you were expressing your individuality and independence.

## Year 0

You're born, the most shocking Uranian experience of all. Talk about independence (from the umbilical cord) and a total change of scenery! I've always thought the symbol for Uranus looks like a baby leaving the womb head first: our first great awakening.

## Year 7

You may have just started school, spending the entire day away from your family. Pretty challenging, kind of scary. You have to find your way through a new set of rules and expectations, and also navigate the scary challenges of the playground, finding your place in a new group of peers.

## Year 14

For many, this is a time when you move on to high school and start all over again in a new social environment. You have some freedom to choose your schedule and classes, and you get to move around to different classrooms throughout the day. Take advantage of opportunities to connect with groups, clubs, and classes that speak to your individual interests.

## Year 21 (Uranus square to natal Uranus)

This is first major challenge in your life's first Uranus cycle. For some, it's the last year of college, when you're facing the prospect of being "birthed" from the educational system in which you've spent most of your life. You're likely to be living away from your family by this age, facing an uncertain future (and in the U.S., just able to drink alcohol legally). Cut loose from familiar moorings, you can feel tremendously excited and free, but also struggle to feel "normal" and connected to others.

# Year 28
This corresponds with the return of Saturn to its position at your birth, and it's likely to be a time when the pressure to achieve within the limits prescribed by society is stronger than the need to be free and independent. You will likely commit to a course of action in this year; will it be one of your own choosing, or one that is designed to keep you safe, but also stagnant?

# Year 35
This usually marks an itch of rebellion against the path you took at age 28. You can see 40, a milestone birthday, in the distance; if you chose the safe path at 28, now is a time you might feel you have to break free. You don't feel completely good where you are, but the alternatives seem imperfect as well. It's the dawn of the midlife crisis (see Chapter 17).

# Year 42 (Uranus opposed natal position)
The next great crisis of your Uranus cycle. It's possible to look back now with fondness at your 21-year-old self, at your uncertainty but great urge to be unique and to live an exceptional life. This is an age when you can really take your life in an exciting new direction. But if you've spent your whole life living by someone else's rules and not really exerting your individuality in a meaningful way, you are likely to over-correct, destroying personal and professional connections in your urge to gain freedom.

# Year 49
Your fiftieth birthday is right around the corner, and it's tempting to tell yourself that you're too old to keep reinventing yourself. But this part of the Uranus cycle can give you a second wind, with interest in new hobbies or technologies and new social connections. Still, you're torn between trying to make one last push to reach the top of your field, or give up on all of that and just do your own thing.

# Year 56
You're getting close to your second Saturn return, and your most productive working years are likely winding down. You may feel as though you want to retire right now, since you're probably fairly tired of responsibility and schedules and pushing for achievement. But really, this is the age to begin the process of disconnecting. You're probably freer now to adapt your work schedule to your needs and to leave your individual mark in your field before retiring. Embrace that, while also looking ahead to new opportunities. During important years in Uranus's cycle, you can be like a giant electronic gizmo that needs to be "grounded." It's important to maintain regular routines, cultivate healthy habits such as regular exercise and sleep, and to use some kind of meditative practice to keep yourself on an even keel during these times.

# Year 63 (second Uranus square to natal Uranus)
Similar to age 21, you're preparing to leave an institutional structure that's been your world for many years. For many, you're nearing retirement from a conventional career, which means you're preparing for a radical change in lifestyle. Connecting with some worthy cause that needs your wisdom and experience will help make this transition easier, by connecting you to a new social network and helping you feel emotionally grounded.

# Year 70
This can be a golden age of friendship for you, with a wide network of acquaintances and involvement in many organizations devoted to your particular interests. This is the time in your life when you can begin to embrace your eccentricities and speak your mind without fear; it may seem unlikely, but you're really at the height of your powers as a potential agent of change.

# Year 77
As the physical realities of advancing age become evident, you may come to terms with the need to adapt your lifestyle to compensate. You may be dealing with the potential loss of some of your independence, and you may find you have to rely more on others than you'd like.

# Year 84 (Uranus return to natal position)
Those who live to this age are, in a real sense, reborn as Uranus returns to its natal position. Even if you've spent a lifetime trying to live by the rules, you may now feel comfortable and even entitled to be a full-fledged eccentric. Your independence, mental sharpness, and irreverence endear you to others, particularly young people.

# Uranus in Motion

As Uranus moves through the zodiac, it awakens society to the need for revolution in some aspect of society. As it moves through the houses of your horoscope, it awakens your need for greater freedom and change in a particular area of your own life. This is a long-term influence, with Uranus spending an average of seven years (more or less, depending on the size of the house in your chart) in each house.

## Uranus moving through Aries/your first house — Freedom to be yourself.

You have the overwhelming need to be free and unconstrained and to reinvent yourself. This cycle often begins with a change—sometimes startling—to your appearance. It's also a common cycle for moving to a new location or ending a relationship that feels too confining. Your temper might be unpredictable, and you may feel the urge to fight for causes that are important to you.

## Uranus moving through Taurus/your second house — Freedom from want.

This is a cycle when you don't want to feel tied down by possessions, financial considerations, or the need for security. You are apt to take significant financial risks, giving up security in order to work for yourself or simply to feel more independent, and may undertake a goal of financial freedom.

## Uranus moving through Gemini/your third house — Freedom of thought.

You refuse to be limited or defined by your knowledge and skill set; you may undertake studies to give you more options, but staying on track with a particular course of study is extremely challenging now. You are drawn to studies of communication and technology and bring great originality and insights to these areas.

## Uranus moving through Cancer/your fourth house — Freedom from history.

You may begin this cycle by moving to a new place, even a new country, far from your home and family. Or you may choose to stay where you are and change the existing dynamics by refusing to accept the status quo. Your mission is to dismantle your earliest conditioning and the rules you've never questioned up to now.

## Uranus moving through Leo/your fifth house — Freedom to be happy.

You won't be told how you may express yourself, how you should pursue happiness, or that you aren't that special. You know full well you're special, and that in fact everyone is unique. Anyone who tries to tell you that your hobbies are silly, your blog self-indulgent, or your parties are boring will face an emotional lightning strike!

## Uranus moving through Virgo/your sixth house — Freedom of work.

You will often begin this cycle by changing your place of employment, sometimes more than once, because you don't want to be owned by a job. You're likely to do best working as a contractor, temporary employee, or self-employed person during this cycle. You may also dedicate yourself to a new health regimen, one that may seem unusual but suits you and allows you to pursue it at your own pace.

## Uranus moving through Libra/your seventh house — Freedom to love.

If you've been in a relationship that is unequal, stifling, or has damaged your self-esteem, you will very likely break free from it now. You are rewriting your rules and ideas about partnership, renegotiating the balance of your needs and those of a partner, and may end up in surprising and unconventional relationships.

Uranus moving through your seventh house is a signal that you or your partner may need more individual freedom than you did before. This doesn't have to mean separate bedrooms, individual vacations, or an open relationship; it may be something as simple as negotiating evenings out with friends. Having the freedom to pursue individual interests is the key to feeling good about your relationship during this cycle.

# Uranus moving through Scorpio/your eighth house

Freedom from dependence. You will make every effort during this cycle to free yourself from debt or other financial obligations that limit your freedom. You can't abide being supported by anyone now, and will probably commit to a program to protect yourself against depending on others in old age or if you become ill or disabled. Your relationship to sex will likely go through some changes now; you may become sexually experimental or feel somewhat asexual.

# Uranus moving through Sagittarius/your ninth house

Freedom of religion. You'll often have a period of rebellion against the prevailing belief systems in your life and in society. Your attitudes toward religion or politics may take a sharp turn, and you will delight in taking an adversarial position in arguments about beliefs. You may wish to study or travel and find it's difficult to commit to higher education or long trips.

# Uranus moving through Capricorn/your tenth house

Freedom of direction. Whether through your own choice or outside circumstances, the direction of your life takes a sharp, often sudden turn. Often, you are being called to a larger future than you had envisioned for yourself, but embracing that future means giving up the script you had already written in your mind. Depending on your age when this happens, you may or may not feel ready for the challenge; it is, however, ready for you.

# Uranus moving through Aquarius/your eleventh house

Freedom of assembly. After changing direction with Uranus in the tenth house, you face the prospect of reinventing yourself within society—especially since you are probably in quite a different society than you were previously. You may lose friends and will certainly make new and important ones. Your greatest struggle during this cycle is finding a way to fit in without abandoning your individuality.

# Uranus moving through Pisces/your twelfth house

Freedom of spirit. These may be years when you hide your "freak flag" in public, pretending to be like everyone else so you can coexist peacefully with others. This means you may feel most free when you’re alone, and time spent in solitude can be incredibly creative and spiritually enlightening. You are extraordinarily sensitive, even psychic now, so it will be important to maintain appropriate boundaries and to protect yourself as needed, to avoid abusing food, drink, or other substances that can dull your feelings.

# Neptune: Cycles of Enlightenment

Neptune's lap around the zodiac takes 165 years. It's the first of the planets for which you won't live to see its return to your natal position. It's the first planet that will never touch every house of your horoscope. You'll never completely know Neptune. And not surprisingly, it's the planetary symbol for that which is unknowable; things we believe in, without any factual evidence. Dreams and imagination that help us see a future that isn't yet there. It's the quality that lets us imagine what it's like to be another person, giving us compassion and empathy. Its cycle is designed to heighten your appreciation for the unknowable hearts of others, an awe for the grand design of which you play a part you don't completely understand.

# Working with the Cycle

Critical ages in this cycle are when Neptune makes aspects to its position at the time you were born.

## Age 19-21 (Neptune semisquare to its natal position)

This is an age when a lack of worldly experience can lead us to have little compassion for others. We declare we'll never live like our parents, never make the same mistakes the previous generation made; the world will be better under our watch.

## Age 26-28 (Neptune sextile)

After a few years in practical world of earning a living and paying bills, you begin to see why others have compromised their ideals out of practical necessity. You may still be discontented with the world, but there are ways you can make the world better within the constraints of your everyday life, if you're willing to try.

# Age 42 (Neptune square)

Part of the midlife crisis cluster of aspects (see Chapter 17), this may be a time of disillusionment and yearning, when you feel you're not being your true self. It can also be a time when you finally realize a long-cherished dream, and experience either the satisfaction of that or a feeling of being let down by reality. In any event, you begin to see that it's time for a new dream.

# Age 55 (Neptune trine)

After some years of spiritual seeking, this is an age when you either find a kind of spiritual renewal, or give yourself over to the habits of escapism (TV, alcohol) or illness. Find something you can believe in.

# Late 60s (Neptune quincunx)

If you haven't formulated a dream for the next part of life, you may find yourself giving in to cynicism and negativity, lacking compassion for others. It's hard to compromise your ideals of what you, other people, and the world should be like, but this is the time to embrace spiritual compromise and realism.

# Age 82 (Neptune opposition)

At the Neptune opposition, we begin the process of letting go of the physical world. We find it easier to understand others, to forgive ourselves for our failings. We grow better able to love the world as it is, instead of dreaming of how we'd prefer it to be.

# Misc.

## Sea and Sky

The planet Neptune was named for the god of the sea because its blue gas clouds reminded early astronomers of great oceans.

# Neptune in Motion

As Neptune moves through the zodiac, it awakens a societal yearning for clarity, compassion, and healing. As it moves through the houses of your horoscope, it awakens your need for peace, surrender, and spiritual awakening in a particular area of your own life. This is a long-term influence, with Neptune spending an average of 12 years (more or less, depending on the size of the house in your chart) in each house.

## Neptune moving through Aries/your first house

The struggle to project a clear persona; dedicating yourself to a specific spiritual goal or compassionate cause, or to involvement in music, art, or dance. Dealing with the frailties or limitations of your physical body. An ability to blend into the woodwork.

## Neptune moving through Taurus/your second house

The need to gain clarity about the physical world and take better care of your body and possessions. Working through unrealistic ideas about money, or dedicating money and resources to charitable causes. Being detached from the physical world while still being responsible.

## Neptune moving through Gemini/your third house

Confronting illusions about your capabilities; are your strengths and weaknesses really what you've always assumed they were? Learning to communicate in a more compassionate way; softening your verbal approach, and engaging in imaginative writing such as poetry, songwriting, or fiction.

## Neptune moving through Cancer/your fourth house

Confronting ideals about home, family, history, your nation. Are your family, our nation, your profession all that you thought they were? Forgiving your family, letting go of history, making reparations for the past.

## Neptune moving through Leo/your fifth house

Are you as talented—or as untalented—as you've been led to believe? How do you really feel about children? Is time spent playing video games and gambling at casinos really enhancing your life? Creative inspiration, but also delusions of grandeur.

# Neptune moving through Virgo/your sixth house

Confronting the reality that you'll never be perfect, and that maybe perfection isn't the key to happiness. The attempt to bring together mind, body, and spirit. The opportunity to make a practical contribution to a cause that's important to you.

# Neptune moving through Libra/your seventh house

Examining ideals and illusions about relationship. Can you forgive partners who hurt you in the past? Are you realistic about what you expect from your current partner, or about the kind of partner you're looking for? Learning to be softer and kinder toward your partner; forming partnerships based on music, art, or spirituality.

# Neptune moving through Scorpio/your eighth house

Who is really in your corner, and how much support do you really need from others in order to get by? How important is sex, and how does it fit into your notions of spirituality and love? Can you be trusted? Can you forgive those who betrayed your trust?

# Neptune moving through Sagittarius/your ninth house

Confronting ideals and illusions about education (would having more make a difference?), big questions of life and death (are you a bad person, planning for your aging parent's death?)? Do your beliefs have a spiritual component or just a physical or intellectual one? Can you forgive teachers, bureaucrats, publishers, or religious figures who let you down?

# Neptune moving through Capricorn/your tenth house

Examining ideals and illusions about ambition and accomplishment. Bringing a softer and more spiritual side to your work and professional reputation. Forgiving parents, teachers, bosses, the government, and other authority figures who've made you feel disillusioned.

# Neptune moving through Aquarius/your eleventh house

Confronting ideals and illusions about friends, fitting in, and your future/legacy. Are your friends, community, and organizations helping you create a legacy of compassion and spiritual meaning? Can you forgive friends, organizations, politicians, the media for any ways in which they’ve hurt you or been untruthful?

# Neptune moving through Pisces/your twelfth house
Confronting ideals and illusions about your own spiritual development; are you making a practice of examining your own motives, secrets, and suffering, or are you living in denial, drinking too much, and taking lots of naps? Are you leaving yourself open emotionally to those who are in need or in pain, or are you shutting off your compassion? Can you forgive spiritual leaders who've betrayed you, or those who've hurt you in secret, shameful ways?

# Pluto: Cycles of Empowerment
Pluto, the most distant planet in our solar system, occupies the outside track in the race around the Sun; Pluto takes about 245 years to journey through the zodiac. Due to a very eccentric orbit, the time it spends in each sign varies; since Pluto was last in Aries, it spends between 12 years (Pluto in Scorpio) and 33 years (Pluto in Taurus) in a sign.

Because it takes so long to make a journey that the Moon, say, completes in 2½ days, we're safe in assuming that Pluto's cycles represent the kind of deep, profound, and transformative changes that take time to unfold. These deep changes involve society as well individuals, and even more so than Uranus and Neptune, Pluto moving through signs represent not just societal change or enlightenment, but movements.

Pluto represents your ability to face hard truths and your willingness to be transformed by some of life's most difficult experiences. Pluto rules power and control, and in Pluto's cycles you taste the limits of your ability to influence your own life. Sometimes—and often at ages when Pluto in the sky has reached a critical moment in its relationship with Pluto in your birth chart—life is painful, unpleasant, and unfair. Confronting mortality, powerlessness, and insignificance are the work of Pluto cycles in your life. Use them to determine whether you become bitter and caustic, or the kind of deep, mature, enlightened figure who others can come to in times of trouble.

Pluto is known as the god of wealth. Venus is the planetary ruler of money, but Pluto is the ruler of big money. Pluto also rules "other people's money"—including financial collectives like banks and insurance companies, and wealthy relatives you hope will remember you in their wills.

## Pluto in Motion

Unlike the other planets, Pluto's important life cycles occur at different ages depending on Pluto's sign at your birth. Most of us will never live to see Pluto travel to the halfway point of its cycle; but all Pluto sign generations experience Pluto's square (90 degrees) to its position in the birth chart. For those born with Pluto in Leo, Virgo, Libra, or Scorpio, this important cyclical passage is occurring at midlife, right in the middle of the other midlife crisis aspects (see Chapter 17). This is a pivotal moment of development in your awareness of mortality and of life stripped down to its bare essence.

There is some overlap between the Pluto generations, while Pluto was making long retrograde journeys back into the previous sign. If you were born during a year when Pluto was changing signs, you'll need to look at your birth chart to find out exactly where it was at your birth.

## Critical Pluto Aspects

Critical life passages are usually represented by slow-moving planets making square or opposition aspects to their position in your birth chart. Because Pluto moves so slowly, most of us experience only one of these, the square. However, the Pluto in Cancer and Pluto in Leo generations will experience the opposition in their mid 80s, and the Pluto in Virgo generation around age 90.

# When Pluto squares or opposes its position in your birth chart

When Pluto squares or opposes its position in your birth chart, loss, grief, and a heightened sense of one's mortality generally come along for the ride. Paying attention to your emotional health is important at these ages; the urge can be strong to crawl into your cave for a couple of years, but don't take hibernation to an extreme.

The age when this aspect occurs varies depending on Pluto's sign at your birth; unlike some planets, Pluto has a very erratic cycle and moves much more quickly through some signs than through others. The following table indicates the age range during which your generation experiences the Pluto square.

## Pluto Cycles by Generation

| Pluto's Sign at Birth | Pluto's Sign Years at Birth | Ages of Critical Point in Pluto's Cycle |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Aries                 | 1822-1852                   | 60-93                                   |
| Taurus                | 1851-1883                   | 86-88                                   |
| Gemini                | 1882-1913                   | 74-75                                   |

| Virgo                 | 1956-1972                   | 39-40                                   |
| Libra                 | 1971-1984                   | 40-41                                   |
| Scorpio               | 1983-1995                   | 36-37                                   |
| Sagittarius           | 1995-2008                   | 48                                      |
| Capricorn             | 2008-2023                   | 58-59                                   |
| Aquarius              | 2023-2043                   | 72-73                                   |
| Pisces                | 2043-2067                   | 86-87                                   |

## Pluto moving through your first house

Empowered personality. The first house describes the personality and other coping mechanisms you've cultivated to help you deal with a confusing world. Now, whatever isn't working in your natural approach to the world will now be painfully revealed, giving you the opportunity to respond to the world with more strength and authenticity.

## Pluto moving through your second house

Empowered security. How have you been dishonest without yourself about the role of money, security, and belongings in your life? Perhaps you believe you can only be poor, or that you need money to be secure, or that belongings are meaningless. You're about to find out if those beliefs are really true.

# Pluto moving through your third house

Empowered message. You notice everything, but learned early on to keep the more sensitive observations to yourself. Now it's time to tell the truth, regardless of the consequences. Keep a pure motive and avoid being honest for the purpose of being hurtful.

# Pluto moving through your fourth house

Empowered belonging. If you had been telling yourself any half-truths about the realities of your family, parents, upbringing, early history, or genetics, now is the time they'll all be stripped away.

# Pluto moving through your fifth house

Empowered creativity. Cut through the ego pollution. If you haven't been telling yourself the truth about your creative pursuits, your relationship with your children, and what would make your life a lot more fun, you're about to have your eyes opened.

# Pluto moving through your sixth house

Empowered service. If you've been telling yourself that your boring job is fine, giving in to easy cynicism about the messed up state of the world, and treating your body less like a temple than like a rest stop bathroom, you're in for a rude awakening. By the end of this transit, you should be on the path to more meaningful work, more responsible stewardship over your health, and a clearer picture of what you can do to make the world less sucky.

# God of the Underworld

Pluto is the Latin name for the Greek god Hades. Hades and his brothers, Zeus (Jupiter) and Poseidon (Neptune), defeated the Titans and divvied up the spoils as follows: Zeus, god of the air; Poseidon, god of the sea; and Hades, god of the underworld.

# Pluto moving through your seventh house

Empowered partnership. The truth about your partner, your own motivations in partnership, and the realities of the relationship itself, are revealed. What's left is the true, essential bond between you, without artifice or illusion.

# Pluto moving through your eighth house

Empowered intimacy. How well, wisely, and honestly do you trust other people? Are you able to be truly honest about what you need from them and what you're willing and able to give? Pluto moving through this part of the chart reveals any power plays, manipulation, or deception in your most intimate and interdependent relationships.

# Pluto moving through your ninth house

Empowered beliefs. If you've been worshiping false gods and graven images, following learned men and women with feet of clay, and pretty much thinking you had the meaning of life all figured out... well, guess what. Nobody has it all figured out.

# Pluto moving through your tenth house

Empowered leadership. If your goals, ambitions, and overall life mission have been based on peer pressure, family expectations, earning potential, world domination, or basically anything other than an honest desire to provide authority and leadership for the development of mankind this transit will not be pleasant. It's time to strip down the engine of your life, right down to the chassis, and rebuild it into something that reflects your authentic character.

# Pluto moving through your eleventh house

Empowered community. Do you know who your friends are? It's time to find out. While Pluto moves through your eleventh house you also get to play whistle-blower and resident burr-under-the-saddle to groups and organizations with which you're involved. Ideally, at the end of this cycle you should be connected only to those friends, groups, or causes that reflect your strongest convictions.

# Pluto moving through your twelfth house

Empowered dreams. The twelfth house is a treasure trove of embarrassing secrets, tender fears, and sacred sorrows. Enter Pluto with his portable x-ray machine, ready to expose your soft, white underbelly to the world—or at least, to you; and even the strongest among us can be brought down by the terrors of our own psyche. By the time this transit ends, you may still have secrets, fears, and sorrows—but you'll have looked each one of them in the eye and really seen them, and they will no longer control you.
