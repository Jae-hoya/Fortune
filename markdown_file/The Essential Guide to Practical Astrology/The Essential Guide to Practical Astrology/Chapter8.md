# Part 3
## A Place for Everything: Houses

In life, stuff happens—and it has to happen somewhere. It happens when you're in line at the supermarket, at work, in the bedroom, or lost within your creative imagination. It happens in your home, in your marriage, on a street corner, interacting with your kids or your friends. Stuff happens everywhere.

In an astrology chart, the 12 sections of the wheel, called houses, show where the important stuff tends to happen in your life—and where your emotional baggage tends to accumulate, like last season's wardrobe in a too-small closet. In the dramatic structure of your life, the houses of your chart represent sets and props that indicate where action is taking place—a parapet, a battlefield in France, a ship. Some of these locations are more challenging territory for you than others. You tend to play out your most important scenes there; like Hamlet hanging out at his mom's house, or Richard III trapped in a deformed body, you become a particular kind of person when you enter them.

Pull out your birth chart. (If you don't have your birth chart, Chapter 2 will explain how you can get one.) The circle represents the sky at your birth, divided into 12 sections called houses. Each is traditionally associated with a sign of the zodiac, at least one planet, a modality, and an element. Depending on which house system you used to calculate the chart, the 12 houses are not necessarily equal in size—but as in so much of life, size isn't everything.

The houses refer to different areas of the sky, and astrologically they symbolize 12 categories of life where the action of your life takes place. The corner coffee shop, your living room, your office cubicle, a crowded train: every story has a setting, represented in one of the houses of the horoscope. As we'll see in Part 4, the planets symbolize primary motivations and lessons to be learned—but the houses tell us where you're likely to play out those motivations and learn those lessons.

Where are things happening? Understanding the houses of the chart can help you understand where you are comfortable, where you find challenge, and where the dramas of your life take place.

## House Cusps
Lines, or cusps, divide the 12 houses. Starting with the first house cusp and moving counterclockwise, houses one through six begin with the cusp on the left side; houses seven through twelve begin with the cusp on the right side. The cusp of each house has a notation about the degree, minute, and sign of the zodiac associated with it, such as:

18° Capricorn 37'

This notation indicates that the house cusp begins at 18 degrees and 37 minutes of the sign Capricorn. Each sign has 30 degrees of 60 minutes each, so this house cusp begins a little over halfway into the sign of Capricorn.

If this were, say, the cusp of the sixth house, we'd know that the first 18 degrees (0-17) of Capricorn lie in the fifth house. The rest falls in the sixth house. Practically speaking, if you have planets between 0 and 17 degrees of Capricorn, they are in the fifth house; between 18 and 29, they're in the sixth house.

# Angles of the Chart

The cusps of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth houses are called the angles of the chart, and are considered highly sensitive and powerful points. Signs on these house cusps, as well as planets within about 10 degrees of them, have particular significance. We'll take a closer look at the angles of the chart in Chapter 9, but here's a quick rundown:

## The Ascendant

The cusp of the first house. The sign on this cusp is sometimes called the "rising sign." The Ascendant marks the eastern horizon and represents your physical body and personal identity—basically, where you begin and others end. It's the "sunrise" angle of the chart, representing how you experience new beginnings.

## The IC

The IC, or imum coeli ("lowest heavens")—The cusp of the fourth house. Sometimes referred to as the nadir, it marks the lowest or northernmost point in the chart and represents your home, family, and personal history.

It's the "midnight" angle of the chart, representing privacy, rest, and the security of home.

The Descendant--The cusp of the seventh house. The Descendant is the "sunset" angle of the chart, symbolizing the waning hours of the Sun's daily cycle. Since the Sun is a symbol of individuality, the angle associated with its weakest hours of the day represents the principle of relationship—giving up some measure of independence to merge with another.

The Midheaven or medium coeli ("middle of the heavens")—The cusp of the tenth house, often notated as MC and sometimes referred to as the zenith. The Midheaven marks the highest point in the heavens, and represents your highest worldly ambitions. It's usually called the angle of career, but that's a little misleading, since we usually think of a career as something we're paid for. We might, actually, think of it as symbolizing your calling—what is the work you're called to do in the world?

# The Daily Circle

The circle of the chart is divided into two sets of hemispheres. These hemispheres can give you an understanding of the tenor of a chart just by glancing at the number of planets on one side or the other of these important lines.


Hemispheres divide the horoscope using the horizon to symbolize day (above the horizon) and night (below the horizon); and the meridian to symbolize the Sun's ascent to its highest point (left of the meridian) and descent (right of the meridian) to its lowest point in the sky.

# The Horizon: Day and Night

The horizon connects the cusps of the first house (symbolizing the east, or sunrise) and the seventh house (symbolizing the west, or sunset), and represents consciousness—how objective or subjective you are in how you understand the world and your place in it. Planets above the horizon are called "day" planets because they occupy the houses where the Sun travels during daylight hours. If you have lots of day planets in your chart, you tend to be outgoing, objective, and ambitious. You play to win, and you're determined to rise above your station—to improve upon the circumstances of your birth.

The Sun is reliably in these houses at roughly the same time each day (except at extreme northern or southern latitudes or near the solstice dates), so knowing which house the Sun should be in will help you ensure that the chart you're looking at has been calculated correctly.

Day planets are those that travel through the top half of the chart at roughly two-hour intervals between sunrise and sunset:

Twelfth house—6 a.m. (sunrise)-8 a.m.
Eleventh house—8 a.m.-10 a.m.
Tenth house—10 a.m.-12 p.m. (noon)
Ninth house—12 p.m.-2 p.m.
Eighth house—2 p.m.-4 p.m.
Seventh house—4 p.m.-6 p.m. (sunset)

Planets that appear below the horizon are called "night" planets because they occupy the houses where the Sun travels at nighttime. If there are many planets in the night portion of the chart, your consciousness is somewhat more subjective, instinctual, and introverted. You're inclined to work behind the scenes and are generally less ambitious for worldly success than someone born with lots of day planets.

Night planets travel through the sixth through first houses at roughly two-hour intervals between sunset and sunrise:
Sixth house—6 p.m. (sunset)-8 p.m.
Fifth house—8 p.m. -10 p.m.
Fourth house—10 p.m.-12 a.m. (midnight)
Third house—12 a.m.-2 a.m.
Second house—2 a.m.-4 a.m.
First house—4 a.m-6 a.m. (sunrise)

# The Vertical Axis: Lust for Power

The vertical axis, or meridian, connects the cusps of the fourth and tenth houses, the points that represent the Sun's positions at midnight (fourth house) and at noon (tenth house). Planets that appear on the eastern side of the chart are called "rising" planets, because they are in the half of the chart that symbolizes the Sun's climb from its lowest to highest points. Planets that appear on the western side of the chart are called "setting" planets; they occupy the half of the chart that symbolizes the Sun's descent from its highest to lowest points.

If you were born with many planets in the rising side of the chart, your nature is assertive and your will and desire for power is strong. You tend to take action without waiting for permission from others (or, negatively, without taking others into consideration).

Rising Houses—Time of Day the Sun Is in House
Third house—12 a.m. (midnight)-2 a.m.
Second house—2 a.m.-4 a.m.
First house—4 a.m.-6 a.m. (sunrise)
Twelfth house—6 a.m.-8 a.m.
Eleventh house–8 a.m.–10 a.m.

Tenth house 10 a.m.–12 p.m.–(noon)

If you were born with many setting planets, your nature is more flexible and relationship oriented. You tend to take others into consideration before acting (or, negatively, can be indecisive).

Setting Houses–Time of Day the Sun Is in House

Ninth house–12 p.m. (noon)–2 p.m.

Eighth house–2 p.m.–4 p.m.

Seventh house–4 p.m.–6 p.m. (sunset)

Sixth house–6 p.m.–8 p.m.

Fifth house–8 p.m.–10 p.m.

Fourth house–10 p.m.–12 a.m. (midnight)

# Wrangling the Houses

The houses of the chart divide each hemisphere into six houses. Each house of the chart shares certain basic themes with a sign of the zodiac, and represents an area of life experience such as partnership, career, and finances. The houses of the chart may be equal or unequal in size; it depends on which house system used to calculate the chart.

Twelve houses are a lot to keep straight. If you refer to Chapter 2, you'll remember that each house is associated with a sign of the zodiac. The first house is associated with the first sign, Aries; the second house with the second sign, Taurus; and so on.

Still, there are a couple of ways to group the signs together that can make them a little easier to remember. Like the modalities and elements that we used to categorize signs, houses can be separated into quadrants (three groups of four signs each) and triplicities (four groups of three signs each). It’s a bit easier, I think, to remember things when they’re wrangled into groups rather than spilling out over one big 12-part wheel.


# House Axes

Two houses opposite one another form an axis. The houses of these axes always share the same degree of opposite signs. If, for instance, you have 14 degrees of Cancer on the cusp of the first house, 14 degrees of Capricorn, its opposite sign, will be on the cusp of the seventh house.

Have you ever heard the maxim that what bothers us in other people are usually the very traits we deny in ourselves? Those we consider our opposites, or even our enemies, are usually more like us than we care to admit—no matter how different we may seem on the surface. Likewise, the signs on either end of the six house axes share common objectives, but they approach them from completely opposite points of view. Picture the center point on the axis as being the common ground, with the two signs inching their way toward the center from their opposite sides of the chart.

The house axes are paired as follows:

* Houses one and seven—The axis of boundaries: self vs. other
* Houses two and eight—The axis of resources: mine vs. yours
* Houses three and nine—The axis of knowledge: learning vs. teaching
* Houses four and ten—The axis of stability: home vs. career
* Houses five and eleven—The axis of creativity: individual vs. collective
* Houses six and twelve—The axis of helping: work vs. altruism

# Succedent Houses by Quadrant

The angular houses are the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth. Associated with the cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn), these are the houses of initiative and leadership.

In the angular houses you define yourself (first house), create a tribe to provide security and nourishment (fourth house), join forces with equal partners (seventh house), and pursue your calling (tenth house). In these houses, you don't sit back and wait for permission to act (or even think too hard)—you operate out of instinct and don't hesitate to go after what you want. (Chapter 9 discusses angular houses in detail.)

The succedent houses are the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh. Correlated with the fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius), these are houses of stabilization and consolidation of resources. In the succedent houses you gather resources (second house), use them to create things (fifth house), combine your resources with the personal resources of others close to you (eighth house), and bring together community resources for the larger work of society (eleventh house). (See Chapter 10 for more about succedent houses.)

The cadent houses are the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth. Linked to the mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces), these are houses of adaptability, synthesis, and release. In the cadent houses you exchange information (third house), analyze it and apply it to practical tasks (sixth house), synthesize it into knowledge and beliefs (ninth house), and use it to explore hidden and even mystical realms (twelfth house). (See Chapter 11 for a full discussion on cadent houses.)

# Houses by Quadrant

| Angular                 | Succedent                 | Cadent                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| First house (Aries)     | Second house (Taurus)     | Third house (Gemini)      |
| Fourth house (Cancer)   | Fifth house (Leo)         | Sixth house (Virgo)       |
| Seventh house (Libra)   | Eighth house (Scorpio)    | Ninth house (Sagittarius) |
| Tenth house (Capricorn) | Eleventh house (Aquarius) | Twelfth house (Pisces)    |

# Houses by Triplicity

Houses are also categorized by the element of the sign that's naturally associated them. There are three houses each associated with the elements of fire, earth, air, and water.

Fire houses (first, fifth, and ninth) are sometimes called "Houses of Life." If you were born with many planets in these houses, you exude energy, enthusiasm, inspiration, and dynamism. These houses represent the limits of matters suggested by the Houses of Substance: the limitations of tenth house conformity (the first house, where we celebrate our individuality); the limitations of second house acquisitiveness (the fifth house, in which we gamble our resources to create something entirely new); and the limitations of sixth house routines and logic (the ninth house, in which we seek new experiences and seek the forests rather than the trees).

Earth houses (second, sixth, and tenth) are called "Houses of Substance." If you have many planets in these houses, you're stable, practical, reliable, and materialistic. These houses represent the limits of matters described by the Houses of Relationship: the limitations of group connections (the second house, in which we learn to rely on ourselves for what we need); the limitations of casual and anecdotal information (the sixth house, in which we test theories and analyze information); and the limitations of one-on-one alliances (the tenth house, in which we seek to reach the broadest market or audience).

Air houses (third, seventh, and eleventh) are referred to as "Houses of Relationship." Having been born with a number of planets in these houses implies that you're a "people person" with a strong need for social connections. These represent the limits of matters described by the Houses of Endings: the limitations of twelfth house faith (the third house, where we ask questions and seek facts); the limitations of staying within your familiar tribe (the seventh house, in which we form our strongest connections with those outside our families); and the limitations of the resources we are able to assemble with just a few people (the eleventh house, in which we form large, strong collectives based on shared interests).

Water houses (fourth, eighth, and twelfth) are known as "Houses of Endings." With lots of planets in these houses, you are likely very sensitive, soulful, and intuitive. These houses represent the limits of matters suggested by the Houses of Life: the limitations of individual ability (the fourth house, where we connect with a tribe or family); the limitations of personal ego and creative ability (the eighth house, where we mingle our sexuality, money, and other resources with another person), and the limitations of cognitive abilities (the twelfth house, where we enter the realms of faith and psychic perception)


# Houses by Triplicity

Fire Triplicity | Earth Triplicity | Air Triplicity | Water Triplicity
---|---|---|---
Houses of Life | Houses of Substance | Houses of Adattonships | Houses of Endings
First House (Aries) | Second House (Taurus) | Third House (Gemini) | Fourth House (Cancer)
Fifth House (Leo) | Sixth House (Virgo) | Seventh House (Libra) | Eighth House (Scorpio)
Ninth House (Sagittarius) | Tenth House (Capricorn) | Eleventh House (Aquarius) | Twelfth House (Pisces)

# Basic Meanings of the Houses

Each house of the chart symbolizes places and situations in your life, as suggested by the symbolism of its quadruplicity and triplicity and the signs and planets with which it's associated. Part 3 offers an in-depth look at the houses, but here is a summary of their key concepts:

* **First house** —An angular, fire-element house associated with the sign Aries and the planet Mars. The first house represents your physical appearance, immediate environment, and response to threatening situations.

* **Second house** —A succedent, earth-element house associated with the sign Taurus and the planet Venus. The second house indicates your attitudes about money and possessions and what things you consider valuable.

* **Third house** —A cadent, air-element house associated with the sign Gemini and the planet Mercury. The third house symbolizes your neighbors and siblings, early education, land travel, language, and communication.

* **Fourth house** —An angular, water-element house associated with the sign Cancer and the Moon. The fourth house describes your attitudes about family, your home, your history, and your country. It's believed the fourth house also represents your mother, or at least your most nurturing parent.

# Fifth house

A succedent, fire-element house associated with the sign Leo and the Sun. The fifth house is associated with children, creative pursuits, self-expression, recreation, gaming, and performance.

# Sixth house

A cadent, earth-element house associated with the sign Virgo and the planet Mercury. The sixth house relates to your job, work style, health, analytical abilities, and pets (this association probably derives from the use of animals to do work, such as on a farm, or as familiars).

# Seventh house

An angular, air-element house associated with the sign Libra and the planet Venus. The seventh house symbolizes your attitudes toward marriage and business partnerships, your closest friends, your open enemies or rivals, negotiation, judgment, and balance.

# Eighth house

A succedent, water-element house associated with the sign Scorpio and the planets Pluto and Mars. Eighth house territory includes shared resources, sexual relationships, investments, death (especially in the sense that "death" of the self is required in order to merge with another), and communal funds of limited membership (investments, taxes, insurance, or inheritance).

# Ninth house

A cadent, fire-element house associated with the sign Sagittarius and the planet Jupiter. The ninth house describes higher education, international travel, belief systems, philosophy, and attitudes toward those who are different from you.

# Tenth house

An angular, earth-element house associated with the sign Capricorn and the planet Saturn. The tenth house represents your profession or calling, reputation, status, ambition, employer, and achievements. It's also believed that the tenth house represents your father, or more specifically the parent who had the strongest influence on your career.

# Eleventh house

A succedent, air-element house associated with the sign Aquarius and the planets Uranus and Saturn. The eleventh house is connected to your capacity for friendship, your social ease, long-range goals, step-children, politics, professional or social organizations, and money earned from your profession.

* **Twelfth house** —A cadent, water-element house associated with the sign Pisces and the planets Neptune and Jupiter. The twelfth house indicates hidden strengths and weaknesses, covert enemies, secrets, illness and suffering, behind-the-scenes activities, and places of confinement (hospital, prison).

Some houses, like some signs, have rather ominous-sounding associations. Death! Hidden enemies! Illness and confinement! Let's face it: life has a nasty side, and if astrology is going to present a complete picture of life, it has to find a way to include its unhappier dimensions. However, resist thinking of any house as intrinsically "bad" or "scary." After all, you'll find death and taxes in the eighth house, but you'll also find sex and inheritance!

# Signs and Houses

Each house has a natural association with a particular sign of the zodiac that shares its essential themes. However, your own chart also has a secondary sign associated with each house, based on the time and place of your birth, which colors your experience of that house.

For instance, the first house is naturally associated with Aries and with the Sun's rising each morning in the east. However, let's say you were born at the time of day when the sign of Gemini was rising on the eastern horizon. Your first house still has an Aries agenda: the search for personal identity, blazing of new trails, and self-defense. But you will use Gemini strategies such as communication and information gathering to do the work of the first house, defining and defending yourself by your ability to learn and communicate.

The degree of the zodiac that's rising in the east at any given moment is called the Ascendant, and it changes approximately every four minutes. This is why knowing the precise time of your birth is so important in calculating your birth chart—four minutes can be the difference between having a bouncy, optimistic Sagittarius Ascendant or a serious, subdued Capricorn Ascendant.

**Astro Tip**

The sign rising in the east at the moment of your birth is sometimes called the "rising sign." It symbolizes your personal appearance, personality, and style of dealing with new situations.

The signs of the zodiac always follow the same order from Aries to Pisces, just as the alphabet has an established order from A to Z; so the sign on the Ascendant determines the signs associated with the other houses. If you were born with Pisces on the Ascendant, then most likely Aries will appear on the cusp of the second house, Taurus on the cusp of the third, and so on.

In some house systems, however, it's not unusual for some signs not to appear on any house cusps at all, while some signs may appear on more than one (sequential) house. In these cases, all 30 degrees of the sign are "intercepted" in a house. The sign is still represented in your chart, but its influence may be more subtle and somewhat more difficult for you to express.

# House Systems

Walk outside on a clear evening and take a look up at the sky. You'll see some constellations, and perhaps the Moon and some planets. What you won't see, however, are lines dividing the sky into houses. Houses are a helpful but almost completely artificial construction, derived from the viewer's perspective relative to fixed points such as the horizon and the Sun's zenith.

There is some controversy among astrologers about the best system of slicing up the horoscopic pie (called "house systems"). That's a nice way of saying that most astrologers have their favorite and if you try to convince them their system is inferior to theirs, you're itching for a fight.

Let's take a closer look at some of the most popular house systems.

## Whole Sign

This is one of the oldest house systems, used in the Hellenistic and early Medieval traditions and also in Indian astrology. In the whole sign system, the horoscope is divided into 12 houses that are exactly 30 degrees each. The first house begins at 0 degrees of the zodiac sign in which the Ascendant falls. The rest of the houses begin with 0 degrees of the subsequent signs, in order. In other words, each house contains a whole sign.

## Equal House

In the equal house system, each house also contains 30 degrees. However, the degree of the Ascendant marks the beginning of the first house instead of 0 degrees of the sign (as in the whole sign system). For instance, if you were born with 13 degrees of Scorpio rising, the second house would begin with 13 degrees of the next sign, Sagittarius, and so on.

## Placidus

Placidus (pronounced PLA-si-dus) is the most common house system in modern Western astrology. If you've ever had your birth chart calculated using a computerized chart service, it was probably calculated using Placidus houses.

Unlike the whole sign and equal house systems, Placidus houses may be much larger or much smaller than 30 degrees and there is the possibility of intercepted signs. Charts calculated using the Placidus house system produce very odd house sizes for locations at extreme northern or southern latitudes. The farther north or south of the equator that you were born, the more likely your chart will have a few very large houses and then a lot of very small ones.

The Koch (pronounced COKE) house system is a variation on the Placidus house system that uses a slightly different method of calculating the cusps of the succedent and cadent houses. Like the Placidus system, it can be a bit unpredictable at extreme latitudes. The Koch house system is especially popular in German-speaking countries (it originated in Germany), but it has gained favor around the world with astrologers who feel it may work more accurately for predictive work. This was my astrology teacher's preferred method, so I adopted it as my own—which, to be honest, is the way many astrologers settle on their favorite house system.

# Derivative Houses

Astrology is a complete system; your birth chart symbolizes absolutely everything—and everyone—in your life. From your mother to your best friend in high school to the cabbie who cut you off on your way to work this morning, everyone who has or will cross your path can be found in your chart. You just have to know where to look.

Each house symbolizes places, situations, and types of relationships, but there are only 12 houses. How can they cover all the characters, both major and minor, in your life's story? Derivative houses is a method of finding relationships through the inherent connection between the houses in your chart. If you're trying to analyze a situation, possibly involving a person for whom you don't have a birth chart, the derivative house system allows you to use your own birth chart to do it. The cusp of the house in your chart that symbolizes the essential nature of the relationship becomes the Ascendant, and a new chart derived from this new Ascendant will help you find the person or matter in question.

Derivative houses is a method that allows you to read a "horoscope," derived from the houses of your chart, for any person in your life. In derivative houses, a particular house of your horoscope is treated as though it were the Ascendant, and the rest of the chart is read relative to that house.

Let's say you're trying to track down the neighbor of your brother's ex-wife (you suspect he stole your teacup pig). Which house of your horoscope can give you information about the alleged thief? Here are the steps you would take to find out:

1. Find your brother. Siblings are found in your third house.
2. Locate your sibling's ex-wife. Spouses past, present, and future are represented by the seventh house. Beginning with the third house (your sibling), count seven houses: the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth. Your brother's ex is represented by the ninth house.
3. Now, to find that elusive neighbor. Neighbors are represented by the third house; so beginning with the ninth house, which represents the ex-wife (it's her neighbor, not yours), count three houses: ninth, tenth, and eleventh.
4. Voilà! Your brother's ex-wife's neighbor is represented by the eleventh house of your chart. The condition of planets in this house or the ruler of the sign on the house cusp describes the person and his current situation.

The pig is a different matter altogether. Livestock is associated with the sixth house. Should you find a connection between the sixth house (the pig) and eleventh house (the sibling's ex-wife's neighbor)—say, Taurus is on the sixth house cusp, ruled by Venus, which is in the eleventh house—it might be time to stand outside your brother's ex-wife's neighbor's house and start hollering "Soo-eeeeeee! "

# Essential Takeaways

* The 12 houses of the horoscope represent where action takes place in your life.
* The hemispheres of the chart divide the horoscope in half, representing day and night and sun's daily ascent and descent.
* Like the signs of the zodiac, the 12 houses can be grouped together by quality and by element.
* Each house is naturally associated with a particular sign and planet.
* There are different methods used to split the chart into 12 houses. Depending on which is used, houses may be different sizes or all exactly the same size.
* Don't have a birth chart for someone in your life? You can read about your connection to them by using the houses of your own chart using derivative houses.
