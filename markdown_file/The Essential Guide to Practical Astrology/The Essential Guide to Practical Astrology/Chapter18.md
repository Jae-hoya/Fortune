Looking for a job? Signing a contract? Confronting your neighbor about his crabgrass? Understanding the Moon's current sign helps you gauge the mood of the day, present yourself to best advantage, and get what you want out of your day.

By far the speediest of our celestial neighbors, the Moon completes a lap around the zodiac in a mere 28 days, spending roughly 2 1/4 days in each sign. To find out the Moon's current sign, consult an astrological calendar or go to my website: WWW.BIGSKYASTROLOGY.COM.

## The Daily Mood: The Moon by Sign

Since the Moon is astrology's go-to symbol for "the public," its journey through the zodiac offers valuable insight into the world's mood on any given day. Each sign is associated with mythical gods and goddesses, guides, wardrobe, and activities to help you make the most of each day.

But because the Moon is a symbol of the unconscious, there's a little bit of intuition involved in reading the day's mood. For each daily Moon sign, I've offered prompts to get your intuition flowing:

* Today's question: Each sign has particular desires and motivations. As the Moon moves through each sign, we have a hunger to fulfill that sign's needs; asking yourself today's question (or, in the case of Gemini, making a statement) will help you do that.

# Today's gods/goddesses
The Moon's sign is ruled by a planet (see Part 4), and its mythology and characteristics influence the day.

# Today's guides
The day's guides teach you to recognize and appreciate the signs of the zodiac at work in daily life. Each sign traditionally "ruled" hundreds of people, creatures, places, and situations; a random sampling of these are presented as your guides for each Moon sign. If you encounter one of these guides today, even if it's on TV or in something you read, observe it. If one of today's guides is a housecat, keep a close eye on your tabby. Why does it do the things it does? How does it get what it needs? What can it teach you about how to approach your day?

# Today's wardrobe
While the Moon is in a particular sign, the public is unconsciously attracted to, and comfortable with, particular colors and other elements of style. Incorporating these into your wardrobe can both catch other people's eye and make them feel more comfortable with you.

# Today's assignments
The Moon's sign lends itself to doing particular things. I've made these general enough to be applied to a variety of tasks and goals.

# Today's Moon in Aries
You're driving your husband to work. You've got 25 minutes to make the 15-minute drive. The weather is clear and the traffic is light. There is no need to rush. Suddenly, from a side street, a car pulls in front of you going 10 miles an hour slower than you were driving. You sigh. You tap the steering wheel impatiently. You grumble. "What's your hurry?" asks your husband.

The Moon is in Aries today—that's your hurry. For Aries, the destination is not the point, and the journey is not exactly the point either. The point is how the journey is made—and it had better be made quickly.

An Aries friend once told me that in his youth, people called him "the young man in a hurry." He was 50 years old when I knew him, and he was still rushing around from place to place. The only time he ever looked unhappy was when he was standing still.

With the Moon in Aries, don't endanger yourself or others—but enjoy the feeling of being in motion. The feeling of speed. The feeling of propelling yourself through the air like an arrow, and the thrill of hitting a bull's-eye.

# Daily Planner for Today's Moon in Aries

Today's mood—Impatient
Today's question—Who am I?
Today's gods/goddesses—Mars, the god of war
Today's guides—Soldiers, martial artists, metal workers, athletes, race-car drivers, percussionists, hawks, stinging insects, lifeguards, rascals, rams
Today's wardrobe—New, stylish, eye-catching
Today's assignments—Start things. Confront people. Do stuff that you've been putting off.

# Today's Moon in Taurus

The lesson of Taurus is that each of us has more than we realize. Some of our blessings are easy to see: good health, a nice place to live, work we enjoy, enough money to meet our needs, friends and family to make it all worthwhile. But other blessings are subtle and fall all too often into the category of "things we take for granted."

Mellow out today. Move slowly. Listen to music, appreciate the view, and breathe in the sweet perfume of fresh air and clover. Today, there is air to breathe. There is the chance to hope that difficulties will be overcome and that good times are ahead. There is the sensation of food in the stomach, or even of hunger. There is pain. There are daytime and night, clouds in the sky, the ground beneath your feet. Against all odds, the world exists—and more unlikely still, you exist. You're alive. If you have just that, only that, you're a step ahead of the greatest, happiest, and most powerful men who ever died.

## Wearing the Moon on Your Sleeve

Each sign of the zodiac is associated with particular colors. Wear these colors on the days when the Moon is in that sign, and you will radiate ease, comfort, and simpatico. Without knowing why, others will gravitate to you as magnetically as a white cat to a black sofa. Going on a job interview or a first date today? These are the colors that will give you the edge over other candidates:

* Aries: Red

# Today's Moon in Gemini

You want to be delighted today. You hunger for mischief, and unexpected questions, and the twinkle of a stranger's eye. You crave words that make you think, and conversation that holds your attention—whether you say much or not, you sure feel like listening to the music of voices.

Not just human voices, either. Today, the whole world is speaking to you. The wind whispers to you through the leaves of the trees. Birds jabber about something that seems urgently important to their birdish brains. Even the half-dozen screaming bumper stickers on the car in front of you have something to say.

What does it all mean? Who cares? That's not the work of today; there will be time to contemplate meaning when the Moon enters Sagittarius. Gemini is simply in the business of collecting impressions and information, trivia, snippets of sounds and smells and colors. Experiment with some new words today … let them roll around on your tongue like tangy, delightful candy. Speak to a stranger. Take a photograph of something that made you laugh.

Listen to the world today.

# Today's Moon in Leo

My friend Monica says that one day when her nephew (born with the Moon in Leo) was about three years old, she offered to take him out into the backyard to "watch him" while he played. She had meant this in a figurative, supervisory sense—but her nephew took it differently. At one point, realizing Monica's attention was wandering, he halted in his tracks, put his hands on his hips, and wailed, "Look at me! I'm playing!"

There for you, in a nutshell, is Leo. When the Moon is in Leo it's time to play, to perform, to make the world laugh with joy, to explore the thrilling possibilities of the human experience. We can sometimes feel a bit disgusted by grown Leo types who make cheap and embarrassing bids for attention—but it's kind of sad, really, when a Leo is overlooked. There they are, playing, creating, expressing their hearts out, and no one notices. So they respond by cranking up their already incandescent personalities to an unbearable wattage, or else they slink off to the lair to nurse their wounded pride. Either way, you end up on the scary side of a dangerous animal.

# Daily Planner for Today's Moon in Leo

The key to enjoying today's Leo lunar energy is simply to play. Celebrate your individuality. Be your own biggest fan. And remember, too, to be an appreciative audience to every person you meet; they're special, too. Pay attention to them—we don't want a lot of dangerous animals running around loose.

Today's mood—Fabulous!

Today's question—How can I have fun and get noticed for it?

Today's gods/goddesses—The Sun, symbol of all life-giving creative power; Helios, the Sun god and the god of sight

Today's guides—Children; performers; roosters; felines; royalty; biochemists; brokers; men in general; people in power

Today's wardrobe—Flashy and well accessorized; tiara optional

Today's assignments—Play. Create. Show off a little. Throw a party.

# Today's Moon in Virgo

An applicant interviews for her dream job at a high-profile technology firm. She's bright, hard working, and talented. Unfortunately, her nails need a manicure, there's a run in her stockings, and her resumé suffers from a severe case of needs-an-editor. Thinking she needed only her sterling job record to land the job, she forgot that it's also important to pay attention to details, and to present her qualifications—and herself—as perfectly and professionally as possible.

The past couple of weeks have been a time to conceive and nurture new ideas, and it's almost time to share them with the world. So while the Moon is in Virgo, review your accomplishments. Fine-tune your work and prepare a polished sales pitch that presents your talents, skills, and creativity in the best possible light.



While the Moon is in Virgo, it's time to be a bit tough on yourself; you have to be willing to face your imperfections before you can correct them. But be sure to temper this process with humor and pragmatism; nothing and no one is perfect, and perfectionism run amok dampens creativity and fun.

# Daily Planner for Today's Moon in Virgo
Today's mood—A little cranky, to be honest

Today's question—How can I help?

Today's gods/goddesses—Mercury/Hermes, messenger of the Gods and God of trade; Vesta, keeper of the sacred flame

Today's guides—Civil servants; maintenance personnel; editors; grain farmers; gardeners

Today's wardrobe—Tailored and deceptively, stunningly simple

Today's assignments—Analyze, soothe, untangle. Balance the books. Edit your resumé. Review contracts.

**Astro Tip**

For about two-and-a-half days each month, the Moon is in the same sign as the Sun was in at your birth. Mark these days on your calendar, because if you really need to wheedle the world into doing your bidding, these are the best times to do it. The days when the Moon is in the same sign as the Moon in your birth chart are days when you are inclined to be especially touchy. And days when the Moon is in your rising sign are days when you can hit the ground running without falling over your shoelaces.

# Today's Moon in Libra

You walk into your neighborhood grocery store to pick up a few things for dinner. Gathering only the items you need, you take them to the checkout counter and realize too late that you're a dollar short. The store doesn't accept credit cards or checks for payment. What happens next? 

It depends on how Libran you are. If you're a frequent customer, you might ask the storekeeper to extend credit until your next visit. You might persuade the cashier with a few carefully chosen—and possibly flirtatious—words to reduce the price on a couple of items. Or you might just return one of your items to the shelf, deciding to improvise a new dinner menu based on whatever's in your pantry and the items you can afford.

While the Moon is in Libra, the whole world is your neighborhood grocery and you're either buying or selling. Whether the commodity is goods, services, or emotional goodwill, doing business with the world is not simply about exchanging goods; it's about exchanging words, feelings, and impressions, and about building relationships based on fairness and trust. While the Moon is in Libra, take the pulse of your relationships with others. How are you different from them, and how are you the same? How can each of you get what you want in a way that makes both of you happy?

# Daily Planner for Today's Moon in Libra

Today's mood—The opposite of what anyone else around you is feeling

Today's question—What is it like to be someone else?

Today's gods/goddesses—Venus, goddess of love, justice, and fertility

Today's guides—Every other person you meet, but especially females; public relations and beauty industry workers; retail workers; diplomats; artists and musicians

Today's wardrobe—Exquisite, and hyper-feminine or -masculine (you choose)

Today's assignments—Learn about yourself through interacting with others. Play nice. Network. Negotiate.

# Today's Moon in Scorpio

Every family has one: a teller of unpopular truths. There's a kid who notices the uncomfortable silence that falls over the Thanksgiving table when Uncle Ralph pours himself a third glass of Cabernet, and proclaims, "Uncle Ralph is drinking so much!" Or a teenager with Morticia Addams hair and makeup who drapes herself in black and informs Mom that Dad is having an affair.

But usually there's also a caring adult in the family whose truth telling is motivated by love for you and interest in your well-being. The spouse who calls you out when you're fooling yourself, or a parent who points out that your new girlfriend doesn't seem to care for you as much as you care for her.

It hurts to hear the truth, even from someone who loves you. It's even harder to tell the truth even when you risk losing the affection of the person you tell it to. But the truth must be faced in order for conditions to change, or for true intimacy to occur. Today is a day to face those truths, and to begin the process of forging deeper intimacy with the people close to you.

# Daily Planner for Today's Moon in Scorpio

Today's mood—Intense, and a little testy

Today's question—What's really going on?

Today's gods/goddesses—Mars, god of war; Pluto, lord of the underworld

Today's guides—Serpents, eagles, undertakers, accountants, therapists

Today's wardrobe—Gothic bordello chic—deep décolletage, crushed velvet, heavy eye makeup

Today's assignments—Defend the helpless. Destroy your enemies. Tell it like it is. Throw away things you no longer need. Consult a counselor.

## Marriage by the Moon

The astrology of marriage is a complicated subject, and personally I can spend hours trying to nail down a really good wedding chart. But it all begins with the Moon. The best days for marriage (other things being equal! —and they often aren't) are when the Moon is in Taurus, Libra, or Cancer. Difficult days for marriage: when the Moon is in Aries, Scorpio, or Capricorn.

## Today's Moon in Sagittarius

What do you eat for breakfast—eggs or cereal? Do you eat standing up, sitting down, behind the wheel of the car, or sitting at your desk? Tomorrow morning, alter your breakfast ritual. Gobble some toast and jam instead of your usual muffin. Scramble your eggs instead of poaching them. Get up 10 minutes earlier and eat your breakfast at home, sitting down, actually chewing instead of gulping.

If you're like most people, this tiny exercise will require supreme effort. Morning routines in particular—performed when you are only semiconscious and operating on autopilot—are a good gauge of your overall tolerance for change and variety. Remaining open to new possibilities is a habit of mind, a habit that can be developed through small changes (like eating something different for breakfast) as well as large ones (changing your career path).

The mood is a little more whimsical and a lot more adventuresome while the Moon is in Sagittarius. Why not try something new? This is the time to sample the new restaurant you've had your eye on, to sign up for the class you've been dying to take, or to draft a list of dream vacation spots. Your heart and mind want to go on vacation today; feed them something new, and watch them soar!

## Daily Planner for Today's Moon in Sagittarius
Today's mood-Adventurous
Today's question-Why not?

Today's gods/goddesses-Jupiter, the god of thunder and pretty much the boss of all the other gods.

Today's guides-Gamblers, pundits, judges, professors, jockeys, publishers, travel agents, clowns

Today's wardrobe-Sporty; something that won't rip when you bend over and will breathe when you run to catch a bus.

Today's assignments-Take a chance; try something new; plan a vacation.

# Today's Moon in Capricorn
My father was a Capricorn farmer who was happy spending hot, humid summer afternoons in absolute solitude, meditatively traversing his acres aboard a tractor. But even in the early 1960s small farms were struggling, so he also drove our school bus-"to support his farming habit," my mom liked to say. He did whatever he had to do to make a go of his farming while supporting his family, working long hours and odd jobs.

Capricorn has the vision to imagine the end goal of any enterprise; the leadership to enjoin others in making it a reality; and the tenacity and single-mindedness to stay on course when others would flounder. No one is more resourceful or determined than Capricorn; he simply will not give up, no matter how hopeless the situation may seem.

While the Moon is in Capricorn, envision your legacy. Examine what needs to be done to achieve your objectives. And then roll up your sleeves, hop on your tractor, and get to work.

# Daily Planner for Today's Moon in Capricorn
Today's mood—Serious and determined. You know: grown-up.

Today's question—Where am I going?

Today's gods/goddesses—Saturn, god of agriculture, civilization, and social order

Today's guides—Elders; captains of industry; engineers; chiropractors; farmers; the poor; ravens; bears

Today's wardrobe—Your finest, most conservative suit. Bust out the pinstripes.

Today's assignments—Prioritize, build, discipline. Start a business. Formulate a long-term plan for your business or your life.

## Astro Tip
The day's mood can be significantly affected by the Moon's aspects to other planets. Even if the Moon is in an upbeat, carefree sign like Sagittarius, the day's mood can be heavier and darker if the Moon is in aspect to Saturn.

# Today's Moon in Aquarius
You're a six-year-old kid and it's your first day at school. Your neighborhood friends go to a different school across town, and your brothers and sisters are either too young or too old for your school. Mid-morning, the recess bell rings and you wander outside with your classmates, who all chatter convivially with one another.

What happens next? Do you strike up a conversation with a friendly looking kid, join a game of dodge ball, or lurk on the sidelines, desperately wishing you were anyplace else on earth? We're odd at heart, each and every one of us. It's both a blessing and a curse that you are not exactly like anyone else. Being unique can be something you wear like a badge of honor, part of the special something you bring to the playground, the dinner table, or the boardroom. Or it can be a stigma that leaves you feeling lonely and maladjusted, never really fitting in anywhere.

Aquarius represents the dichotomy between celebrating what is unique about you and finding a place where you belong. This is why Aquarius is the sign of friendship: friends are those like-minded souls who like you precisely because you're unique. Moon in Aquarius days are no time to stand on the sidelines and watch the other kids playing ball. Instead, no matter how solitary you may be by nature, this is the time of each month to make an effort to participate in society's games and to bring all your unique gifts to bear in furthering communal interests.

# Daily Planner for Today's Moon in Aquarius

Today's mood—Friendly

Today's question—Where do I belong?

Today's gods/goddesses—Saturn, god of agriculture, civilization, and of social order; Uranus, god of change

Today's guides—Eccentrics, visionaries, entrepreneurs, politicians, motivational speakers, colleagues, members of organizations

Today's wardrobe—Shiny fabric and jewelry; electric colors; anything a little weird

Today's assignments—Join a club. Gather with friends. Organize a protest. Get something pierced.

# Today's Moon in Pisces

True mystics have always enjoyed hanging around with a bad crowd. This is not to say that every grungy-looking kid slouching around the corner convenience store is a mystic, or even a nice guy. It's just that if you want to learn how to truly love everybody, you should hang around with those society finds most difficult to love. You'll either turn to the bottle; end up insane, dead, or disillusioned; or become a black belt in unconditional love.

Pisces is a true mystic. Unlike his opposite sign, Virgo, Pisces has to work to develop the gift of discrimination; his nature is to get along with everyone and accept them as they are. He sees himself in everyone, but particularly identifies with the meek and powerless. And Pisces is sensitive, all right; but unlike his water sign brethren, Cancer and Scorpio, he has no crusty exoskeleton to protect him. So early on, Pisces learns the art of escape—it's his only survival technique when fisherman stalk him with nets, spears, and tasty lures.

While the Moon is in Pisces, remove your shell for a couple of days and try seeing life through another's eyes. Be humble. Practice compassion for those you feel deserve it least. And set down the burden of judgment—you'll be amazed how much more energy you have! If you find all this immersion in the human race exhausting, go ahead and escape in a nap, a day at the beach, or a favorite CD. But the best in our Pisces selves will never escape from our responsibilities to those under our care, or to whom we've made important commitments.

# Daily Planner for Today's Moon in Pisces

Today's mood—It's all good, bro.

Today's question—Where is the love?

Today's gods/goddesses—Jupiter, the god of thunder and pretty much the boss of all the other gods (this explains why Pisces are not really as meek as they're made out to be); Neptune, the god of the ocean, representing Pisces's primordial connection with all other beings

Today's guides—Fish and fishermen; mystics and priests; poets, painters, and music makers; drunks and addicts; your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore, the homeless tempest-tossed

Today's wardrobe—Think Stevie Nicks and any male rock singer who wears a feather boa—lots of gauzy fabrics, velvet, lace, possibly feathers

Today's assignments—Just to love, and be loved in return. Oh, and maybe some meditation, a nap, a little swimming, some music, and a comforting visit or phone call to a friend in need.

# Today's Lunar Aspects

Walk into a home, an office, a restaurant, almost anyplace—and you immediately sense the rhythm of the people who spend time there. Is it a steady, quiet rhythm, or a stimulating, syncopated one? Do you feel at peace there, or challenged? And have you noticed that there are some days when everything from interpersonal interactions to getting a tune-up on your car just seems to flow better than on other days?

In astrology, this flow of energy is symbolized by the Moon's aspects with other planets. If the Moon makes most friendly aspects to other planets in her 2½-day journey through a sign, things tend to go pretty smoothly. But if she makes bad aspects to other planets, the result is sort of like walking through a very beautiful house but tripping over loose rugs and hitting your shin against the corners of sharp tables. Pretty soon, you don't even notice the nice artwork on the walls, or the lovely view of the lake.

Pull out your trusty astrological planner or calendar and you'll see a list of the day's planetary aspects. If your calendar shows a day full of squares and oppositions, it's likely to be a bit of a tough day, regardless of which planets are involved.

When the Moon is in harmonious aspect to a planet, it's generally a good day to pursue matters related to that planet. If the Moon is making a difficult aspect to a planet, matters associated with that planet will require extra effort and may lead to aggravation:

* Moon in aspect to the Sun—Harmony (conjunction, trine, sextile) or conflict (square, opposition) between wants and needs, conscious and unconscious, actions and our responses. See Chapter 19.

* Moon in aspect to Mercury—Intellect and feelings are in harmony (conjunction, trine, sextile) or in conflict (square, opposition).

* **Moon in aspect to Venus**—Harmonious, affectionate, and comfortable (conjunction, trine, sextile); moodiness and domestic difficulties (square, opposition).

* **Moon in aspect to Mars**—Energy and emotional conviction (trine, sextile); aggression, impulsiveness, volatility (conjunction, square, opposition).

* **Moon in aspect to Jupiter**—Optimism and urge for adventure (conjunction, sextile, trine); poor judgment and overindulgence (square, opposition).

* **Moon in aspect to Saturn**—Benefits through hard work and discipline (sextile, trine); depression or pessimism (conjunction, square, opposition).

* **Moon in aspect to Uranus**—Readiness for change and independence, original and spontaneous (conjunction, sextile, trine); disruptions, restlessness, accidents (square, opposition).

* **Moon in aspect to Neptune**—Sympathy, intuition, imagination (conjunction, sextile, trine); impracticality and escapism (square, opposition).

* **Moon in aspect to Pluto**—Clearing the emotional air (conjunction, sextile, trine); uneasiness, jealousy, secretiveness (square, opposition).

# The Void-of-Course Moon

After the Moon has finished making all of the planetary aspects, it will make in its current sign; we say that it is void-of-course until it moves into the next sign. (That's "without a course"—not, "void … of course!") The void-of-course period can last a few minutes or a day or more; it depends on the positions of the Sun and planets relative to the Moon.

A void-of-course Moon refers to the period between the Moon's last major aspect in a sign until it moves into the next sign. The void-of-course period varies in length, but there is a void-of-course Moon every couple of days.

Some astrologers regard the void-of-course Moon period as a sort of mini "day of rest." The traditional interpretation of the void-of-course Moon period is that anything you initiate under its influence is pretty much dead on arrival. So initiate nothing, say nothing, don't lift a finger, some astrologers say, as though the void-of-course Moon were the Sabbath. This seems a tad impractical for busy people with lives to lead.

I think it's more helpful to regard the void-of-course Moon as a period when things sort of … continue. There is a momentum to the Moon's two-and-a-half day journey through a sign, a momentum that builds as the Moon grazes up against contentious or flowing aspects to other planets. And when that last aspect has sounded like a gong, we can stop in our tracks to listen to the reverberation, or we can ride along on the sound waves.

You won't be traveling through this particular area of the emotional landscape for another 28 days. So while the Moon is void-of-course, savor the reverberations of the Moon's journey here. Pause if you can, but move on to new things if you must; just understand that it's likely they'll reverberate at the same pitch as the old things.

!Astro Tip

When the Moon is void-of-course, do take actions such as mailing your tax return, that you don't wish to lead to further actions (such as a tax audit). When the Moon is void-of-course, don't start things that you hope will continue to grow and improve, because it won't turn out that way.

# Essential Takeaways

* The Moon's sign symbolizes the mood and appropriate activities of the day.
* The Moon's daily aspects to other planets describe whether the day will flow smoothly or with difficulty.
*  The void-of-course Moon is a time when the Moon has completed all its aspects to other planets before changing signs.
*  The void-of-course Moon is best for initiating actions that you don't wish to lead to further actions.
