## Where You Dance: The Cadent Houses

The cadent houses: third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth

Each cadent house is associated with one of the mutable signs

The third house: communication, siblings, neighbors, and short trips

The sixth house: work, health, habits, and service

The ninth house: higher education, knowledge, long journeys, and religion

The twelfth house: faith, the unconscious, confinement, and illness

To modern ears, "cadent" is an odd, archaic-sounding word. It's related to "cadence," or rhythm in dance or music; in music, a cadence is a progression of chords moving toward a resolution. These are houses of resolution, then, but even more interesting is the part about rhythm. In the cadent houses, you learn to dance with life by attuning yourself to its rhythms. In the third house you master the rhythms of language; in the sixth, the rhythms of work and daily rituals; in the ninth, the rhythms of the workings of the universe; and in the twelfth, the rhythms of rest and release. In the cadent house, you learn to handle the discord and tension that come just before release. You learn to adapt to new realities and to expand your effectiveness and consciousness. You learn to loosen your grip on structure and routine, in preparation of making changes. In the cadent houses, you learn to let yourself go—and ultimately, just to let go.

## Third House: Dances with Words
The third house was traditionally called the "House of Communication." We often equate communication speaking, and certainly the third house symbolizes the learning and mastery of written and spoken language. But communication is a two-way street, requiring a listener as well as a speaker. The third house is also about perception, the ability to listen, observe, and notice things.

The third house also symbolizes your siblings, neighbors, and early education. Your brothers and sisters taught you the talismanic power of words, of promises and proprietary claims, of nicknames and teasing. Identical twins are famous for developing secret languages no one else can understand, but if you spend 10 minutes with any pair of siblings who are reasonably close, you will quickly encounter an impenetrable fog of in-jokes and verbal shortcuts. Siblings teach us the skill of encoding and decoding messages, of understanding our world and making ourselves understood. Our interactions with siblings teach us how to argue and negotiate, how to twist the knife, how to tell a joke, and how far we can go without completely alienating someone.

By negotiating a role for ourselves among our siblings, we define ourselves. To a lesser extent this is also true of our neighbors, to whom we're also yoked by common turf, mutual interests, and subtle competition. Few of us would admit that we feel pressure to "keep up with the Joneses," but it's difficult not to compare your old jalopy and crabgrass-infested lawn to your neighbor's bright new sedan and expensive landscaping. We naturally compare ourselves to those whose circumstances closely resemble our own—just as we might compare ourselves with a brother or sister.

# Rulerships and Key Concepts

The third house is associated with the Gemini, the third sign of the zodiac, and its ruling planet, Mercury. Like Gemini, the third house belongs to the mutable quality and the air element.

Key concepts of the third house : Communication, learning, memory, practical skills, siblings, neighbors, early education, short trips, land transportation.

# Signs

The third house shares a lot of territory with the sign of Gemini. It symbolizes your style of communication, relationship with neighbors and siblings, and ability to collect and share information. In your chart, the third house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the cusp or signs contained within the third house
* Planets in the third house
* The sign and house placement of the planet that rules the sign on the third house cusp

## Aries in the third house

You are a straight shooter, speaking directly, plainly, and sometimes impulsively. You think fast on your feet and are an able and incisive debater. Relationships with your siblings may be strained, with a lot of competition and arguments, and you may also find yourself at odds with your neighbors. You are probably well suited to a career in transportation or communication (such as journalism).

## Taurus in the third house

You consider your words carefully before speaking, which can sometimes give the mistaken impression that you think slowly as well. You're a person of few words, with a calm manner and a mesmerizing speaking voice. Your relationships with your siblings are generally good, although there may be more than the usual squabbles about sharing, and your relationships with neighbors are slow to develop but generally cordial.

## Gemini in the third house

You are one of the smartest people around, with a balanced intellect, the ability to listen as well as you speak, and the ability to figure out how to do almost anything. You're probably extremely close to at least one of your siblings, even if you don't necessarily agree on everything. You like to be on a first-name basis with your neighbors but generally avoid getting too close to them.

# Cancer in the third house

You're extremely perceptive, very funny, and rather secretive, even with people you know well. You tend to be closely attached to your siblings, whether for good or for ill. You are either the social hub of your neighborhood, the lynchpin that draws everyone together, or else you jealously guard your privacy and rarely so much as make eye contact with your neighbors. You're extremely sensitive to noise and discord.

# Leo in the third house

You're a dazzling communicator, artistically gifted, adept at writing and speaking but better at expressing than perception. Hopefully you and your siblings enjoy one another, but you probably compete strenuously for attention. You're warm and friendly with neighbors and are usually well known in your community.

# Virgo in the third house

You're formidably intelligent and an excellent analyst; nothing escapes your notice. You're a little self-conscious about speaking in public, and your tendency to edit yourself while you're creating can make creative writing a challenge, but you're an excellent teacher or editor. You're protective of younger siblings but your relationships with older ones can be harshly critical. You like to be of help to your neighbors, but can grow irritable if they take advantage of your kindness.

# Short Journeys Over Land

The opposite house from the ninth ("House of Long Journeys Over Water"), the third house represents short trips, particularly by land. It's the house of cars, trains, bicycles, motorcycles, skateboards, and buses. In contrast to the ninth house's academic bent, the third is the house of folklore and storytelling.

# Libra in the third house

You have a naturally artistic temperament and a refined way of expressing yourself. You're a natural at negotiation, and your keen sense of public relations could be put to good use in your profession. You tend to have intense rivalries with your siblings, but to build strong friendships among your neighbors. You are likely to marry the boy or girl next door, or at least someone who shares a background very much like your own.

# Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, and Aquarius in the third house

**Scorpio in the third house** — You fear others having the power to divine your thoughts, so you're secretive, sarcastic, and blunt. Your friends value your willingness to be completely—even brutally—honest; everyone else fears your sharp tongue. Relationships with your siblings are fiercely loyal or almost completely estranged, with no in-between. You often gravitate to "difficult" neighborhoods with many who are down on their luck; you like living in environments that are a little raw.

**Sagittarius in the third house** — Unlike Scorpio in the third, you have no secrets and are open and effusive. You're a lively speaker and teacher and are a natural at communicating through visual media such as film; you are more interested in conveying your knowledge and beliefs than gathering new information. You may hardly know your siblings, or feel you have little in common with them.

**Capricorn in the third house** — Like all the earth signs, you think before you speak. You prefer communication to serve a practical purpose, and may well make a career in communication. You can have a hard time being friendly in casual situations, and may find it hard to get close to your neighbors or, in your youth, to your classmates. You do best in situations where you're clearly a teacher/mentor or a student/protégé, and not a peer. You're often a surrogate parent to your siblings, or otherwise feel responsible for them.

**Aquarius in the third house** — No one knows what will come out of your mouth or your computer keyboard—you're an original thinker, and you like to shake people up and make them think when you speak or write. Your siblings are your best friends, and your best friends feel like siblings. You generally like your neighbors, and you like to settle in and stay in one place for a long time, so you generally get to know everybody.

# Pisces in the third house

Imaginative and sensitive, you may seem otherworldly but you absorb everything around you and miss nothing. You are easily overwhelmed by talk and noise, probably a bit psychic, and need to retreat periodically to rest your nerves. Usually you get along fine with your siblings, even if you feel you don't have much in common; you probably maintain a bit of distance with your neighbors because you don't have the energy to get sucked into their dramas.

# Sixth House: Meaningful Habits

The sixth house was traditionally called the "House of Servants." For those of us who don't have servants, it's associated with the routines that comprise most of our days—working, running errands, preparing meals—as well as the habits we form while repeating these routines. For the most part, we regard the boring minutia of daily life as necessary but dull, and entirely separate from the really important work of our careers and relationships. The domestic tasks associated with the sixth house are denigrated, and when possible, delegated.

But something is lost, I think, in our determination to avoid these humble occupations; the sixth house is also the house of ritual, the performance of activities for symbolic purposes. Both habit and ritual involve doing particular things at regular intervals in a particular way. What distinguishes them from one another? Intention, and consciousness. You can sweep the kitchen floor each evening and hardly notice doing it, beyond a vague desire to have it over with as quickly as possible. But imagine you instead treat the chore as a ritual, giving your full attention to sweeping the floor carefully and thoroughly, visualizing the debris and disorder of your mind being swept away with the bread crumbs. Feel the difference?

Why make such a big deal out of sweeping a floor? Because life is a finite resource, and it's maddening to waste five minutes every day—more than 30 hours each year!—on an activity that is meaningless. And yet the floor needs to be swept—a consequence of inhabiting a body that walks on things, eats things, and spills crumbs. If you don’t occasionally sweep up the debris, pretty soon it offends the senses and can even breed disease. Sowhy not enjoy sweeping the floor, clearing it of life’s thriving, lively messiness? Why not use those five minutes as a sort of practical prayer, to celebrate being alive?

# Rulerships and Key Concepts

The sixth house is associated with Virgo, the sixth sign of the zodiac, and its ruler, Mercury. Like Virgo, the sixth house belongs to the mutable quality and the earth element.

Key concepts of the sixth house: Work, service, routines, health, adaptation, analysis, fixing problems.

# Signs

The sixth house shares a lot of territory with the sign of Virgo. In your chart, the sixth house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the sixth house cusp and signs contained in the sixth house
* Planets in the sixth house
* The sign and house placement of the planet that rules the sign on the sixth house cusp.

**Aries in the sixth house** —A natural leader in the workplace, you also thrive in work environments involving danger or risk (firefighter, EMT). Strenuous, competitive, solitary exercise is your key to good health; health problems are related to anger, frustration, or accidents, with the head and teeth being especially vulnerable.

**Taurus in the sixth house** —A steady and reliable worker, you're most comfortable with a leisurely pace and a regular work routine. You're drawn to the arts and to work involving personal finance. You hate strenuous workouts and sweat; Your best health regiment involves a moderate diet combined with stretching and comfortable walks. You're generally healthy, but overindulgence and inactivity can lead to problems with your throat, thyroid, and neck.

# Gemini in the sixth house

You need a work routine with variety and flexibility; solitude or too much sameness will drive you nuts. You're suited to work in communications, telecom, or transportation. Avoid overwork and especially stress, which can lead to health problems related to the nervous system, your lungs, and your shoulders and hands.

# Cancer in the sixth house

You have a gift for creating a family atmosphere in the workplace, and are suited to work related to public advocacy, children, women's issues, or domestic issues (food, hunger, or shelter). Health problems commonly emerge in the stomach and breast areas and are due to internalizing emotional stress; swimming is an excellent workout for your mental and physical health.

# Leo in the sixth house

You need to stand out at work, to be considered the best at what you do and to have the respect of your colleagues. You're a steady and reliable worker, but you get temperamental if you're ignored or treated as an underling. You're well suited to careers with a performance aspect to them, such as teaching or training. Your heart and back are your vulnerable spots; yoga would be an excellent workout to relieve your stress and promote flexibility.

# Virgo in the sixth house

You're a superb technician and craftsman, flexible and versatile and good at almost everything. You're at home in health care, science, teaching, or analytical jobs; above all, you need to feel that you're making a useful contribution and are encouraged to do quality work. You're vulnerable to digestive problems and need exercise that relieves stress, a careful diet, and plenty of rest and quiet.

The sixth house is associated with jobs, the daily tasks that fill your days and hopefully earn your living, whereas careers are found in the tenth house. Ideally, you'll find a way to bring your sixth house job into alignment with your tenth house calling—but sometimes, of course, a sixth house job is necessary to pay the bills while you pursue your tenth house dream career.

## Libra in the sixth house

Above all, you need a social work environment and the feeling of contributing to beauty, justice, and fairness. You're at home in the arts, human resources, public relations, marketing, or law, but you're happiest when you're in charge or working in an equal partnership. A balanced diet and emotional equilibrium are essential for your health; your vulnerable areas are your kidneys, lower back, and adrenal system.

## Scorpio in the sixth house

You need a job that allows you to be in control of your own work and takes advantage of your ability to handle life or death situations, such as surgery, EMT, firefighter, or lifeguard. You're not terribly diplomatic in the workplace; health problems are aggravated by resentment, anger, and power struggles. A solitary form of exercise such as swimming can help you avoid problems with the reproductive organs, genitals, bladder, and rectum.

## Sagittarius in the sixth house

You need to feel that your work has meaning; you're unhappy in a job that doesn't have a connection to what you consider your calling. Academia, science, publishing, and travel are also congenial work environments for you. Get exercise that increases flexibility, stretches muscles, and is done outdoors, such as horseback riding or hiking. Your vulnerable spots are your hips, thighs, and upper legs.

## Capricorn in the sixth house

A resourceful and tireless worker, you're effective in any kind of business as long as you have the authority to make important decisions in your work. You're particularly well suited to banking, building, or government work. Your vulnerable areas are the joints and skin, so exercise should focus on encouraging flexibility, strengthening the muscles around your joints, and relieving stress (good for the skin).

# Aquarius in the sixth house

A dependable and innovative worker, you need a regular routine and a convivial workplace. Your talents and temperament are suited to technology, nonprofit organizations, government work, and science (especially social science). Your ankles are vulnerable to injury, so get gentle, low-impact exercise such as bicycling that improves flexibility and coordination and strengthens muscles around joints.

# Pisces in the sixth house

You're imaginative and have a talent for tapping into what the public wants, but you need an unstructured daily routine and a work that feels meaningful. You might be drawn to social work, commercial art or advertising, or metaphysical practice (especially tarot). Your feet are your vulnerable area, so get low-impact exercise such as swimming and yoga.

# Ninth House: What Do You Know?

The ninth house was traditionally known as the "House of Long Journeys Over Water." It represents long-distance travel, but the "water" of its traditional name is metaphorical as well. You also experience the ninth house in situations and interactions that are very different from the ones you grew up knowing, and any scenario—travel, education, religion—that stretches you to grow in a fuller understanding of the world. Whether you're boarding an international flight, eating Ethiopian food for the first time, or struggling to stay awake in a university lecture hall, you've entered ninth house territory.

I was born with many planets in this house of the chart; it's little wonder I grew up to be the first in my family to graduate from college and that I married someone from another country. And from an early age, I had strong beliefs about the way the world worked. When I was small, my parents sent us to the tiny country church down the road from our house. I didn't enjoy it; in particular, I disliked the preacher who yelled at the congregation about hellfire and damnation until his face turned red. "Why, he doesn't even know me!" I remember thinking. "How does he know whether I'm going to hell?" One Sunday morning, in the middle of one of his tirades, I simply stood up and walked out. When I got home I announced in no uncertain terms that I would not be going back. I had my own ideas about salvation, and they didn't include getting yelled at.

The more emphasis on the ninth house of your chart, the more you care about knowing. Religion offers one way of knowing, science another; academia teaches us how to convert information into real knowledge. You may take any one of these paths, or all of them, or none. The ninth house of your chart describes your relationship to knowledge and believing. Is yours a pragmatic philosophy or an idealistic one? How driven are you to explore the farthest reaches of the world and of the ideas you grew up with?

The ninth house is associated with Sagittarius, the ninth sign of the zodiac, and its ruler, Jupiter. Like Sagittarius, the ninth house belongs to the mutable quality and the fire element.

Key concepts of the ninth house: Higher education, overseas travel, teaching, religious occupations, foreigners, foreign languages

# Signs

The ninth house shares a lot of territory with the sign of Sagittarius. It symbolizes your beliefs, education, knowledge, desire to travel, and experience of being an outsider. In your chart, the ninth house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the ninth house cusp and signs contained in the ninth house
* Planets in the ninth house
* The sign and house placement of the planet that rules the sign on the ninth house cusp.

# Aries in the ninth house

You're a pioneer at heart and love foreign travel and people from different backgrounds. You believe in the need for survival and self-preservation, and that one of the best qualities a person can have is a fighting spirit.

# Taurus in the ninth house

You're probably not completely wild about long-distance travel; it's too uncomfortable, and you're constantly having to change your routine and cope with unfamiliar things. Your philosophy of life tends to be gentle, non-confrontational, and based in practical, everyday lessons.

# Gemini in the ninth house

Language is the most daunting part of international travel for you. If you take long trips, you'll tend to enjoy short stays in many places rather than long stays in a couple of places. You probably find all religions pretty interesting but have a hard time completely embracing any one. You'll tend to favor either higher education related to information and communication, or done by correspondence or in a trade school.

# Cancer in the ninth house

You believe in the importance of family and belonging, and that each of us has a responsibility to take care of others. You may make your home in a land far from the country of your birth.

# Leo in the ninth house

You believe in the primacy of the individual, that each of us is unique and has something to say that's worth listening to. You're creatively inspired by other cultures, by travel, and by education and pride yourself on your ability to connect to people from other backgrounds.

**Astro Tip**

In the third house you gather information, in the sixth house you analyze the information, and in the ninth house you seek to understand the facts as you know them. But the ninth is a cadent house, so don't get too attached to What you know; in the twelfth house you let go of rational understanding and enter the realm of faith.

# Virgo in the ninth house

You believe in the importance of service. Any religion you're drawn to will emphasize service and helping, and the betterment of oneself.

# Libra in the ninth house

You believe in fairness, that each of us must pull our weight and put as much into life as take from it. You may find yourself connected to foreign lands or new religious traditions through marriage or other partnerships.

# Scorpio in the ninth house

You believe in honesty, loyalty, and the importance of seeing things as they truly are. Experiences of death or trauma directly influence your beliefs and are an important component of them. You keep your beliefs close to your vest and can converse about religion or politics without revealing your own thoughts.

# Sagittarius in the ninth house

You're convinced that you've got the world figured out and that your beliefs are the right ones. You have strong feelings about religion—either devout or agnostic. You believe in taking a scholarly approach to beliefs. You tend to be very vocal, even occasionally preachy, about your beliefs.

# Capricorn in the ninth house

You believe in individual responsibility, and for you "the buck stops here." If you are religious, you will probably rise to a position of leadership and authority in your church. Your career is likely related to ninth house matters such as publishing, travel, academia, or religion.

# Aquarius in the ninth house

You believe in personal liberty and individual freedom, yet are likely to be associated with food coops, unions, or other collectives. You’re given to radical beliefs and a strong rebellion against the beliefs you grew up with or that are imposed upon you. Pisces in the ninth house —You believe in kindness and helping others. You’re unlikely to be strongly attached to a particular religion, likely considering yourself more spiritual than religious. You are likely to spend time abroad and are likely interested in working for human rights or other groups in helping the underdeveloped world.

# Pisces in the ninth house

You believe in kindness and helping others. You're unlikely to be strongly attached to a particular religion, likely considering yourself more spiritual than religious. You are likely to spend time abroad and are likely interested in working for human rights or other groups in helping the underdeveloped world.

# Twelfth House: Letting Go

The twelfth house was traditionally known as the "House of Troubles." The astrology books of an earlier era generally had hard words for the twelfth house. It was the house of confinement, imprisonment, illness, even insanity—the house of hidden enemies and self-undoing.

There's no doubt that prisoners, invalids, and monks are still among us and are certainly a feature of the twelfth house landscape. But relatively few of us will spend significant time behind bars, laid up in a sick bed, or devoted to prayerful solitude. What's the twelfth house mean for us?

You know, being a little bit sick can be a good thing. When you're a bit too ill to go to school or work, but not too ill to enjoy a movie on cable or a good book, illness can be a way of getting time out from your usual routines. Like a vacation, but without the expense or the onus of having to visit every notable attraction within a 50-mile radius, having a bad head cold may be one of our few opportunities to take a time out.

The twelfth is a house of rest, reflection, and letting go. Modern times are hectic, and it's hard to carve out time to devote to these tasks. It's no wonder many of us struggle to get a good night's sleep, to understand what's in our heads and hearts, and to let go of the hurts, slights, and torments that undermine our happiness. Signs or planets (see Part Four) associated with the twelfth house indicate where and how you find refuge, and the work you need to accomplish through rest and retreat.

# Rulerships and Key Concepts

The twelfth house is associated with Pisces, the twelfth sign of the zodiac, and its rulers, Neptune (modern) and Jupiter (traditional). Like Pisces, the twelfth house belongs to the mutable quality and the water element.

Key concepts of the twelfth house : Faith, the unconscious, rest, reflection, illness, confinement.

# Signs

The twelfth house shares similar territory with the sign of Pisces. In your chart, the twelfth house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the twelfth house cusp and signs contained in the twelfth house
* Planets in the twelfth house
* The sign and house placement of the planet that rules the sign on the twelfth house cusp.

**Aries in the twelfth house** — It's not easy for you to relax. If you have Taurus on the first house cusp, others rarely suspect just how much anger and competition lies beneath your placid exterior. Getting strenuous exercise is a good way for you to relax and let go of your anger and your need to be first.

**Taurus in the twelfth house** — You're pretty good at relaxing, enjoying spa-like indulgence, great food and drink, and pampering. You're willing to spend significant money on luxury items and getaways, but especially if you have Gemini in the first house, few would suspect that you have a materialistic, even hedonistic side. It's hard for you to admit to your craving for things. Focusing on the enjoyments of the natural world is a good way for you to relax. 

# Gemini in the twelfth house

Resting is not easy for you because you have a hard time turning off your brain. You relax through writing, reading, and learning, but if caring Cancer is in your first house, others will little suspect your cerebral and restless side. It's hard for you to let go of your need to maintain free agent status and to explore an endless variety of interests.

# Cancer in the twelfth house

You keep your private thoughts to yourself and consider time spent with your family to be sacred. If you have outgoing Leo in the first house, others would be amazed to find out just how vulnerable and easily hurt you are. It's hard for you to let go of your need for safety and nurturing.

# Leo in the twelfth house

Time spent alone is vital to your physical and creative vitality. If you have modest Virgo rising, few realize your need for recognition and how hurt you can be if you're overlooked.

# Virgo in the twelfth house

You never relax, probably don't sleep well, and are quite susceptible to stress-related illness. Gentle exercise such as walking or yoga, and meditation or prayer, are extremely beneficial for you. If you have upbeat Libra in the first house, few suspect just how hard you work to make everything look so easy, and how critical you can be of yourself as well as others.

# The twelfth house

The twelfth house symbolizes the ability to surrender, to admit when you are exhausted or discouraged and need help. Trying to be strong all the time can lead to illness, disruptions in sleep, and even phobias. No one likes to admit they're feeling overwhelmed by troubles, but it's better than ending up in the hospital, jail, or an asylum (all associated with the twelfth house!).

# Libra in the twelfth house

You relax by spending time with your partner or through music and art. If you have intense, protective Scorpio rising, few realize just how much you want to be liked. It's very hard for you to give up the "disease to please," and to let go of the desire to avoid unpleasantness and conflict at almost any cost.

# Scorpio in the twelfth house

You relax by retreating into your fertile imagination and spending time alone. If you have a happy-go-lucky Sagittarius Ascendant, people would be shocked to know how dark your view of the world can be, and how tenaciously you hold on to a grudge. It's extremely hard for you to let bygones be bygones, and to let go of your need to constantly be in control.

# Sagittarius in the twelfth house

You relax best when you're outdoors, especially in a beautiful and preferably unfamiliar place. If you have conservative Capricorn in the first house, few suspect that you can be funny and that you always feel a little bit like an outsider. It's very hard for you to admit you're wrong about anything, or to change your point of view even in the face of indisputable evidence.

# Capricorn in the twelfth house

Like Virgo in the twelfth, you never relax, but you're made of iron and rarely let infirmity slow you down. If you have friendly Aquarius rising, few suspect that you're tough as nails and extremely ambitious; it's hard for you to let you of a plan, even if it's clearly not working out.

# Aquarius in the twelfth house

You relax by connecting with like-minded souls—your fellow "inmates." You're the stereotypical geek living in your mother's basement and chatting in Internet forums. If you have loving, accepting Pisces rising, others would be amazed by how opinionated you can be and how easily you can detach from others.

# Pisces in the twelfth house

You escape through sleep, and sometimes drugs, alcohol, food, or other addictions. If you have feisty Aries rising, other would be stunned to learn just how sensitive you are. You find your concern for others so overwhelming that you look for any way to escape from it. It's hard for you to develop appropriate boundaries while still remaining emotionally open to your loved ones.
