# Part 1
## Astrology as a Second Language

In Poor Richard's Almanac, Ben Franklin wrote of astrology, "Oh the wonderful knowledge to be found in the stars. Even the smallest things are written there if you had but skill to read." Astrology is the language of the stars, with its own alphabet and grammar. Before you can read its wisdom about matters great and small, you first have to learn to speak the sky's language.

In this part, you'll be introduced to the ABCs of astrology and to its mysterious vocabulary. You'll discover what astrology is and what it isn't, why your horoscope can get it wrong, and why you may be nothing like your Sun sign. You'll find out how to get a copy of your birth chart, and how to make heads or tails of its upside-down world. And you'll find out what astrology is good for, other than annoying your sister (the scientist) and offending your brother-inlaw (the minister).

I'm an astrologer; that's my day job, and it's the kind of profession that makes your accountant look at you funny the first time she prepares your tax return. But when I clock out at the end of the day and take off my astrologer cap, I do the same kinds of stuff that you do. That includes taking part in a variety of social rituals in which strangers break the ice by asking, "And what do you do for a living?"

That question presents an awkward moment for an astrologer. Some people really don't like astrology, and even those who do like astrology often don't understand much about it. So if I'm truthful about my job title at a cocktail party, I'm risking an evening of either trying to redeem myself in the eyes of someone who thinks I'm a complete flake, or fielding questions from someone who wants to know why Scorpios keep breaking their heart. Which is why I usually fudge and answer truthfully, if incompletely, that I'm a writer—and then I change the subject.

Astrology is a rich, complex, fascinating study, and so thoroughly misunderstood by both its detractors and its fans that there's just no way to do the subject justice over white wine spritzers and tiny 2 Part 1: Astrology as a Second Language cocktail franks. So let's pretend that you and I met at this party and decided to grab a cup of coffee afterward. Comfortably ensconced in the cushy leather banquette of a dimly lit diner, sipping the worst coffee known to man, we’ve got nothing but time. So let’s talk astrology.

# What Is Astrology?

Astrology is the study of the connection between celestial activity phenomena and earthly events. Those who practice astrology are called astrologers. (The term "astrologist" is sometimes used, but never by astrologers; to be honest, it makes us cringe, though we're not exactly sure why.)

The word *astrology* comes from the Greek *astrologia*, meaning "telling of the stars." Astrology is essentially a language—the fine art of speaking in stars. An astrologer is someone who practices astrology.

The main tool in the astrological toolbox is the astrology chart, sometimes called a horoscope (from the Latin *horoscopus*, or "hour watcher"). Based on the date, time, and location of an event (any event, not just a person's birth but also things like marriage, natural disasters, or the founding of a country), an astrology chart is a map of the sky that's divided into 12 sections and includes

* **Planets.** These include the Sun and Moon (for convenience, usually referred to as planets) and the eight known planets, including Pluto. (Yes, although its official status has been downgraded to planetoid, astrologers have observed Pluto long enough to respect and fear it as much as we do any full-fledged planet.) In their interpretations, some astrologers also include Chiron, a planetoid that orbits between Saturn and Uranus, and Ceres (a dwarf planet), Pallas, Vesta, and Juno (asteroids), which are located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Sun, Moon, planets, major asteroids, and fixed stars each have specific astrological meanings that reflect fundamental human needs, such as relationship, boundaries, and intellect. If life were a play (which, in many ways, it is), then planets would be the characters.

* **Signs of the zodiac.** The zodiac is a band of fixed stars that flanks the ecliptic, which is the path the planets travel across the sky. Usually just called "signs," each of the 12 zodiac signs is associated with particular characteristics and qualities that describe personal style and defining attributes. In a play, signs would be the characters' personalities and costumes.

* **Houses.** Houses are the 12 sections of the horoscope, symbolizing the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets in relation to the horizon and the meridian. Each house symbolizes a specific area of life experience, such as work, finances, and relationships. In a play, houses would be the settings where scenes take place.

* **Aspects.** The angular relationships between the Sun, Moon, and planets are called aspects. Aspects describe the ease or struggle of integrating various parts of your life or psyche. In a play, aspects would be the dialogue between characters.

Now that you know a little bit more about what astrology is, let's look at some of the things astrology is not:

* **Astrology is not astronomy.** Once upon time, the two studies were one. Astronomy worked out the physical properties of the heavens, while astrology figured out what they meant. There was a falling out between the two disciplines around the time (1632) that Galileo confirmed the reality of a heliocentric universe (in which the earth and other planets revolve around the Sun), casting a pall over the geocentric (in which the earth is the center of universe and everything else revolves around it) system of astrology. Today, astrology still relies on astronomical measurements as the basis for its art, while astronomy generally tries to ignore astrology's existence altogether. So whatever you do, don't call an astronomer an astrologer—or, heaven forbid, ask him "his sign." Things could get ugly! Astrology is not science, despite its reliance on scientific tools (measurements of planetary motion and complex mathematics). Astrology has not been proven, by use of the scientific method, to be a reliable predictive tool. There are astrologers who feel that, given time and funding, astrology could be proven scientifically. But for now, astrology can't claim to be a science.

* Astrology is not clairvoyance. Most astrologers admit to using some intuition in their interpretations, but astrology is an art of reading symbolism, not people's minds.

* Astrology is not palm reading. Palm readers divine human character and fate based on—well, palms. Hundreds of years ago palmistry was aligned with astrology, with each finger and mound of the hand associated with a planet. However, hands are not the heavens, and so your study of astrology will not include learning to tell the head line from the heart line.

* Astrology does not use tarot cards. Both are symbolic systems that can be used for divination or for self-analysis, and many (but not all) astrologers and tarot card readers know and use both systems. However, astrology and tarot are two different symbol systems, and the study of astrology will not teach you how to read tarot cards.

* Astrology is not numerology, which uses numbers to explore earthly affairs. Again, some astrologers know and use numerology, but numerology—since it doesn't refer to a connection between the earth and sky—is not the same thing as astrology.

## No Turban Required!

The sorts of people who are drawn to astrology are often interested in a variety of other metaphysical practices as well. One day you may find yourself face-to-face with a crystal ball-peering, tarot card-reading, I-Ching-throwing, clairvoyant astrologer wearing a turban. But of all this person's many facets, it's only the part about reading charts of the sky that makes her an astrologer. For the modern practitioner of astrology, turbans are strictly optional


# A Symbolic Language

Astrology is a language; it's the sky's way of speaking to us about every facet of life, from love to investments. Astrology uses an alphabet of planets, signs, houses, and aspects and connects them into meaningful patterns with specific grammatical rules. ("Venus in Scorpio in the third house, square Mars in Leo in the twelfth house" is, believe it or not, a phrase that will mean something to you by the end of this book.)

Like any language, astrology symbolizes things, and interpreting language's symbols can be a complicated business. Do an online search for the word "anchor" and you'll find pictures of everything from a device for mooring ships to television news announcer Walter Cronkite. Likewise, each of astrology's individual symbols has a variety of meanings; how the symbols are interpreted depends on both context and the astrologer's skill with the language.

# How Does Astrology Work?

Astrology is based on the belief that there is a relationship between what happens in the sky and what happens on earth. A favorite maxim of astrologers, "As above, so below," implies that a set of universal laws governs both earth and sky. But to be completely honest, no one seems to be sure exactly why or how this works.

# Cause vs Cosmic Coincidence

Modern astrologers mostly dismiss the concept of causation—that is, the idea that the planets physically affect life on earth. We don't imagine that planets billions of miles from earth are emanating compelling rays that move us around like pieces on a chessboard. At least, no one's proven it.

Rather, the modern view of astrology is that there is a pattern of meaningful coincidence between celestial and earthly events. Some propose that earth and heaven have a sort of fractal relationship (a fractal can be split into parts, each of which is a pint-sized replica of the larger whole). Many also point to Carl Jung's theory of synchronicity, which explores the phenomenon of two or more events occurring together in a meaningful manner, without one having appeared to cause the other to happen. For example, let's say you're sitting outside a café with a friend, recounting a dream you had last night about adopting a Jack Russell terrier. Just as you finish describing the dream, someone walks by your table with a Jack Russell terrier, which takes one look at you, leaps into your lap, and starts licking you.

Mere coincidence? Or the universe's oblique way of leading you into dog ownership?

!Astro Alert

Using astrology to predict specific behavior or events is unreliable, for one very good reason: human beings are unpredictable. It's that pesky free will that makes it hard to predict exactly what people will do. The less control someone has over his own life, and the less self-aware he is, the easier it is to predict what will happen to him—with or without astrology.

# Astrology and Fate

Certain traditions of astrology are inclined to view astrology through the lens of fate—that is, that certain things are destined to happen to you based on the condition of the sky at the time of your birth. Generally speaking, it seems the fewer options for personal choice within a given society, the more fatalistic the tone of its astrology.

In the West, where individuality and self-determination are cherished values, we're taught from birth that we can be and do anything we want (unless we are 5'2" and wish to become a supermodel). Our astrology tends to reflect this thinking, and it's more common to find astrology used as a tool for self-understanding rather than as a window into one's fate. The prevailing thought is that astrology reflects life's circumstances—it doesn't create them, anymore than your nationality, gender, or genetics create them. As Shakespeare rather elegantly put it, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves."

But as the impossibility of being a 5'2" supermodel suggests, we are limited by certain conditions of our birth. Seen that way, it's possible that astrology describes another set of conditions imposed at birth that limit what is possible for us. In her book *The Astrology of Fate* (see Appendix C), the great astrologer and writer Liz Greene, however, uses the term "fate" unabashedly in exploring its relevance to astrology:

As with many people, the presence of extreme suffering invokes in me the question of meaning. But for me, the roads of human perversity and catastrophe do not ultimately lead to the comforting paternal arms of a benign Judaeo-Christian God whom we must not question nor do they lead to the indictment of society as the source of all ills. Rather, they lead to fate.

Regardless of whether you view astrology as a reflection of your fate or simply as a kind of cosmic blueprint for your life, all astrologers agree that even the smallest of life's details are reflected in the conditions of the heavens. The question is how rigidly we're bound to play those conditions out in a particular way.

## Astrology and Prediction

"You have amazing planetary activity for marriage this year," the astrology student announces to the practice client sitting across the table from her. "You could meet someone and be married within 10 months!"

Across the table, the practice client—his neighbor's 10-year-old daughter—blinks in confusion.

Astrologers can predict things based on knowledge of symbols and cycles. But these predictions are based on an interpretation of symbols. Astrology is a rich system, but it's not as though there's an astrological symbol that looks like a wedding couple on a cake, which wanders across the chart one fine Saturday and gets you married. Remember, symbols can always be interpreted in a variety of ways, and context plays an important role in all astrological interpretations.

But aside from that, I've always found the concept of prediction a bit worrisome, as it implies a static future that's sitting there waiting for you to catch up with it. How can that be, when in any given situation you usually have a number of options for how you can choose to act or react?

And that doesn't even take into account the number of other people whose own decisions and choices limit and define the options available to you. Again, the matter of prediction returns us to the question of fate and its place in astrology. Regardless of your thoughts about fate and the prediction of specific events, there's no question that astrology excels at telling you "what time it is"—which ideas and impulses are currently calling you to grapple with them. In astrology, as in life, you may not be able to choose what happens to you (perhaps that is a question of fate)—but you can certainly choose how to respond to what happens to you.

# "That's Not Me!"

## Scenario #1:
You crack open the morning paper and sneak a peek at the horoscope column, specifically the few cryptic lines associated with "your sign." You snicker at the vague and unlikely pronouncements and shake your head. How could anyone believe such nonsense?

## Scenario #2:
As a gift for your early January birthday, an office friend presents you with a coffee mug emblazoned with an illustration of a goat, the word "Capricorn," and a handful of adjectives such as "serious," "mature," and "ambitious." In response to your baffled expression, your friend explains that Capricorn is your sign and so you can be described using these adjectives.

Yet you're hardly the picture of maturity and ambition—you're 35 years old, you work in the mailroom, and your mother is constantly hollering at you to grow up, already. What gives? Popularized astrology based on the signs of the zodiac, such as newspaper and magazine horoscopes and sun sign personality lore, provide a valuable service: they introduce people to astrology in a way that's practical and easy to use. The problem is that most people stop there, and base their opinions about people, situations, and astrology based on fairly shallow information. Let's take a closer look at these popular forms of astrology which, while useful in their way, can offer only limited insight.

# Your Sign

When your well-meaning co-worker referred to "your sign," she was referring to the zodiac through which the Sun appeared to be moving the time of your birth. The Sun spends 8 Part 1: Astrology as a Second Language approximately 30 days in each sign. Of course, we're moving around the Sun, not the other way around; so when astrologers say "your Sun is in Capricorn," they really mean that the Sun appeared to be in Capricorn at the time of your birth.

The Sun is the single most important body in our sky; without it, we would literally perish. Its importance to life on earth is unquestioned, and therefore it holds a lot of weight and significance as an astrological symbol. In astrology, the sign symbolizes your entire reason for being, the central focus of your life. For that reason, you actually can usually tell quite a lot about a person by examining his or her Sun sign.

But not everything—because the Sun is not the only important object in the sky. The Moon, moving through the entire zodiac in a mere 28 days, is vitally important as well. So are the visible planets—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. And Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, though invisible to the unaided eye, are significant members of our celestial family. At any given moment, each of these is moving through a particular part of the sky, in relation to the zodiac, the horizon, and each other. Each of them offers insight into unique and fascinating you.

To get more out of a horoscope column, read the forecast for your rising sign (see Chapter 9 for details) as well as for your Sun sign.

# Horoscope Columns

There's an assumption among many that any trained monkey can sit down and write the horoscopes that appear in newspapers and magazines. I don't doubt that there are people out there with no knowledge of astrology who are simply making up horoscopes. For that matter, monkeys really are pretty smart, so maybe there's one out there that can crank out a bogus forecast. However, I've read many, many horoscope columns in my life and in each and every one I could detect the astrological rationale for the interpretations given.

The problem with horoscope columns is that they're based on what's currently happening in the sky relative to your Sun sign—only your Sun sign, and not the other planets and the houses of the horoscope and all that other neat stuff that makes you uniquely you. So the poor writer, struggling to make a living as either an astrologer, a writer, or (heaven forbid) an astrology writer, concocts something that's both as specific and as general as possible for each twelfth of the population born with the Sun in a particular sign.

Don't assume astrology is hopeless just because your horoscope in the newspaper misses the mark. A horoscope column is a sort of astrological caricature based on one tiny part of your full astrological profile. The answer is not fewer horoscope columns, or even better monkeys—just a broader view of why horoscopes give a limited view of things.

# Practical Uses for Astrology

As far as most of us know, astrology has three important uses:

* To learn more about our favorite topic: ourselves
* To learn more about the people we're romantically interested in
* To predict the future

This is all good stuff, no doubt about it; but it presents a portrait of astrology that's painted in rather broad strokes. Actually, you might be surprised at the myriad practical uses for astrology. Most rely on the basic components of planets, signs, houses, and aspects. Let's look at some of the most popular.

## Natal Astrology

Natal (related to birth) astrology assesses your characteristics and tendencies based on the day, year, exact time, and location of your birth. Newspaper horoscopes and coffee mugs with descriptions of your Sun sign, as well as in-depth readings by a trained astrologer, are all examples of natal astrology.

## Relationship Astrology

Relationship astrology can help you sort out the compatibility and challenges between you and interesting others based on the day, year, exact time, and location of your respective births. Synastry compares the position of the planets in one person's birth chart with the planetary position in another person's birth chart. Composite charts are derived from a combination of the planetary placements in two birth charts—they're two charts in one!

An ethical astrologer will not give you an in-depth reading of another person's birth chart without his or her permission. If you consult an astrologer for relationship advice, you can expect an analysis of general information that helps you understand the relationship—but not an assessment of what the other person will do, or is thinking or feeling.

## Electional Astrology

Electional astrology is the process of choosing ("electing") the best time to do something, such as getting married or starting a business. Save this stuff for important actions with far-reaching consequences; plotting the best time to shop for produce or get your shoes resoled is probably a bit obsessive.

# Horary Astrology

Horary (from the Latin for "hour") astrology answers a question based on the moment the astrologer receives and understands it. If you need a simple answer to a burning question, such as "Does Selwyn fancy me?," you pose the question to a horary astrology specialist, who will glance at her watch, cast a chart for the moment, and deliver a simple "yes or no" answer. Horary is best suited to simple, clear-cut questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no," questions about the outcome of a particular situation, or even how to locate lost objects.

# Mundane Astrology

Mundane astrology studies world affairs and events—outcomes of political elections, monarchy ascending to the throne, corporations being formed, countries picking fights with one another. This was the early astrologer's bread and butter—predicting wars, famine, plagues, and the like. There are still mundane astrologers around; in a troubled world, theirs is a nerve-wracking profession. You'll recognize them by their fretful expressions and anguished muttering.

# Financial Astrology

Financial astrology relies on planetary cycles to predict gain and loss in the financial markets and the commercial marketplace. After the natal astrologer tells you you're entering a dicey time financially, a financial astrologer can talk you down with detailed advice about buying low, selling high, and diversifying your portfolio and whatnot.

# Medical Astrology

Medical astrology studies the correlation between planetary symbolism and cycles and the health and illness of individuals. The signs and planets are associated with the parts of the body, and by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of these in your birth chart, a medical astrologer can help you navigate the heartbreak of psoriasis and postnasal drip.


# You Can Learn Astrology!

Like any language, astrology has a learning curve. Some people pick up a language pretty easily; others struggle. Some can learn most of what they need on their own, from books and Internet resources; others do better within the structured environment of classes and workshops.

The good news is that you already know about 90 percent of what the very best astrologers know: you understand life, the world, and human nature. You have knowledge, skill, empathy, and life experience. In other words, just because you're new to astrology doesn't mean you're a beginner at life. You're 90 percent of the way to knowing how to use astrology to better understand yourself and your world. This book is designed to teach you the other 10 percent: astrology's symbols, and how to interpret them.

# Essential Takeaways

* Astrology studies the connection between the heavens and earthly affairs.
* Astrology refers to charts of the sky, not crystal balls, clairvoyance, palms, tarot cards, or numerology.
* Astrology and astronomy were once a single field of study, but are no longer connected.
* Modern astrologers do not believe the planets cause things to happen on earth, but rather that they reflect a pattern of meaningful coincidence between celestial activity and earthly affairs.

Among the uses for the astrology are understanding individuals, evaluating compatibility between people, answering pressing questions, choosing good times to act, understanding financial cycles and world affairs, and assessing physical illness.
