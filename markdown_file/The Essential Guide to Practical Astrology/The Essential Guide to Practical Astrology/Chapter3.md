# Part 2
## Signs of the Zodiac

The zodiac. For as long as you can remember, its beasts and mythical figures (plus, inexplicably, one machine) have stared back at you from T-shirts, coffee mugs, and calendars. Almost everyone knows his or her "sign" and has read a horoscope column. For most people, the signs of the zodiac are astrology. In fact, they're not. But what does the zodiac bring to the table? Emerging from the symbolism of seasonal rhythms, constellations, and myth, the signs of the zodiac are like the personalities and costumes of characters in a play; some dress in colors of manipulation, like Lady Macbeth, others in Henry V's inspiring leadership, still others in the doomed romanticism of Juliet.

In this part, the zodiac's 12 characters are presented in four groups. Each group contains three signs of the zodiac that share certain qualities of temperament, and each has a leader, an organizer, and a Greek chorus. You'll learn which group is which and what role each sign plays within it, which will help you understand what makes each sign tick and how to anticipate their needs and behaviors in love and in work.

# The 12 signs of the zodiac

The 12 signs of the zodiac, usually referred to simply as "the signs," are astrology's most recognizable symbols. You probably know a little something about them; you may even have strong opinions about a few. In this chapter, get to know the "Sky Critters"—the 12 signs of the zodiac.

The signs of the zodiac offer a vivid introduction to the 12 essential archetypes that are astrology's building blocks. They're not the be-all and end-all of astrology, but understanding their symbolism can help you understand the personal style, attitudes, and approach to life of those who wander into your orbit.

# What Is the Zodiac?

The 12 signs of the zodiac take their names and symbols from the band of constellations flanking the ecliptic, which marks the Sun's apparent annual journey across the sky. Each sign represents a particular set of archetypal characteristics that are based on the time of year when the Sun moves through its part of the sky. In an astrology chart, the characteristics of the zodiac describe your attitudes, approach, and personal style.

Traditionally, the zodiac is divided into 12 signs of 30 degrees longitude each. These signs are named after 12 of the 13 constellations flanking the ecliptic. The signs serve as a kind of backdrop against which the planets, Sun, and Moon appear to move relative to earth. When we say "the Sun is in Aries," for instance, we mean that it appears the Sun is moving through the sign of Aries.

# The "Wrong" Zodiac

You're sitting at dinner with friends, chatting enthusiastically about your new interest in astrology. Your friend who graduated with a degree in astronomy pipes up: "I don't know how you can believe in astrology. It's not even based on the correct positions of the stars!"

He's right. Most Western astrologers use a system known as the tropical zodiac, which aligns the vernal equinox with the first degree of the first sign, Aries. However, because of the precession of the equinoxes, the vernal equinox is now in early Pisces. This precession is ongoing, with the difference between tropical and sidereal positions widening about 1 degree every 72 years.

Whereas astrologers who use the sidereal zodiac (including the majority of astrologers in the East) refer to the current position of the stars, tropical astrology is based on the seasonal association of the signs with the season in which the sun rises in them. To tropical astrologers, who favor a symbolic or metaphorical approach to the zodiac, the fact that the solstice points have shifted to another constellation is beside the point. Tropical astrology is based on our relationship to the Sun, not to the stars.

> Definition
Most modern Western astrologers use the tropical zodiac system. This is a metaphorical, season-based approach that aligns the vernal equinox with the beginning of Aries, the first sign. The sidereal zodiac uses the actual position of the Sun at the vernal equinox, which has shifted backwards into early Pisces.

So your astronomer friend is right—about tropical astrologers, anyway. In fact, the astrological community itself is divided on the topic of which zodiac is the "right" one. When you're reading horoscope columns or astrology articles in the West, however, you can safely assume that the tropical zodiac is being used, unless stated otherwise.

# Signs Aren't People

As you read the chapters that follow about the signs of the zodiac, bear in mind that what we're talking about are archetypes, not individual people. When you read something like "Leo is magnanimous and outgoing," your mind may immediately object that your August-born aunt is, in fact, shy and retiring. This is where the astrological skeptic proclaims victory and changes the subject. But allow me to gently reintroduce the topic, with the explanation that although your aunt was born when the Sun was in Leo, she has an entire birth chart full of planets and placements and aspects that may contradict or mitigate the Leo archetype.

Think of it this way. In the world of film, there are various familiar stereotypes that allow you to grasp the essence of a character without a lot of time-consuming flashbacks or exposition. You know them as the wise-cracking best friend, the crusading cop, or the plucky career gal with the disappointing love life. But the best and most memorable films have a habit of elevating these tired stereotypes to archetypal status, representing something true and universal in the collective unconscious. The star-crossed lovers from opposite ends of the tracks are a stereotype. Positioned in an important historical context, however—such as Rose and Jack on the Titanic, or Scarlett and Rhett during the Civil War—and their relationship may take on archetypal importance, representing the human impact of these historic events.

Archetypes are idealized representations of some trait or quality in the collective unconscious. This is different than stereotypes, which are simplified, generalized, and often negative representations based on qualities such gender, race, or status—or, in the case of astrology, on one or two people you once met who were born with the Sun in that sign!

Signs are not people—they're characters, archetypes. Placing different planets, like different actors, in a particular sign gives the archetype a different flavor. Signs can be thought of as a costume to be worn. Place Venus, the planet of love and also of attractive young women, in Virgo, a sign of modesty and practicality, and your film character looks a bit like a lovely and slightly shy secretary. Cast Mars, the planet of war, in analytical Virgo, and your character might be a studious young war reporter during World War II.

# We're a Mix of All Signs

Nothing makes an astrologer sadder than hearing someone say, "Oh, I hate [insert sign here]." One of the favorite arguments against astrology is, "There is no way that everyone in the world can fall into 12 neat categories," and you'll get no argument from me. Gross generalizations about the signs of the zodiac are, to me, as baffling as declaring you hate vegetables just because you've eaten a couple of overcooked brussels sprouts over the years.

The fact is, each of us contains every sign of the zodiac in our birth chart. The horoscope is a representation of the entire sky at the time of your birth. Every constellation along the ecliptic, whether it was visible or not from the place of your birth, is fully represented in the 12 houses of your birth chart. So declaring war on any sign of the zodiac is tantamount to disowning part of yourself.

You have the opportunity to experience each sign of the zodiac in your own life. If Leo falls in the sixth house of your chart, for instance, you get to "be a Leo" in sixth house areas of your life (at work, for instance). As each planet moves through a sign, it activates that archetype somewhere in your life. Some, such as the signs of the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant (cusp of the first house) at your birth, may speak through you more strongly than others. We'll learn more about how this works in practice in upcoming chapters. For now, it's enough to understand that all 12 signs are part of your birth chart, and all are relevant to your life.

**Astro Alert**
Don't disown or disparage any sign based on past experiences. If you've had a number of bad experiences with people born with the Sun in a particular sign, you may decide you "just can't get along" with people of that sign. But who knows how many people with that sign strong in their charts that you've met without knowing it, most of whom you probably got along with splendidly? Signs are not people—and all of them are a part of you.

# Bright and Dark Sides

No sign is inherently good or bad. Decades of pop Sun-sign astrology have done a disservice to nearly all the signs of the zodiac, with a few signs (such as Virgo and Scorpio) suffering blows to their reputations as a result of simplistic astrology.

In astrology we regard each of these sign archetypes as symbols of essential roles in the human drama. In the hands of a "good actor," a sign's most noble traits naturally emerge. But bad motivations bring out the worst traits of signs as well as people.

A sign has a bright side and a dark side. Traditionally upbeat planets (Venus, Jupiter) or difficult ones (Saturn, Pluto) in a sign can tend to sway the balance of bright and dark one way or another for you, but ultimately, it's up to you which side shows itself most often in your life. Can you live up to each sign's best qualities, or will you give in to laziness or malevolence and portray its darker side?

# Planetary Rulerships

In astrology, each sign is associated with one or more planets called the "ruler(s)" of that sign. In much the same way as a director instructs an actor how to play a part, a sign's planetary ruler gives off-screen instructions to that sign.

For example, the planetary ruler of the sign Taurus is Venus. If you were born with planets in Taurus, they will act out Taurus themes about stability, determination, and financial security. But they will also take some cues from the placement of Venus in your chart, and if Venus is in a very different kind of sign than Taurus—say, Aquarius—you will tend to experience conflict. In this case, the conflict might be between the desire for change (Venus in Aquarius) and Taurus’s desire for stability.

# Shared Rulerships

Two planets, Mercury and Venus, each rule two signs. Mercury is the ruler of both quick-witted Gemini and analytical Virgo, and Venus rules earthy, sensual Taurus and refined Libra. Some astrologers suggest other rulerships for Virgo, including Vulcan (a hypothetical planet between the earth and Mercury) and the asteroid Vesta. The Earth, which is usually not represented in the astrology chart, is sometimes proposed as more in keeping with the earthy, practical nature of Taurus. But this dual rulership also seems relevant to Venus's association with both money (Taurus) and relationships (Libra).

# Modern vs Traditional Rulerships

Before the discovery of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, the signs Aquarius, Pisces, and Scorpio were ruled by Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, respectively. Many astrologers still refer to these "traditional" rulerships, especially in horary and electional astrology (discussed in Chapter 1).

It's also helpful to think of the modern and traditional rulerships as representing the duality of these signs. Aquarius, for instance, certainly reflects the qualities associated with its modern ruler, Uranus—rebellious, unconventional, and innovative. But Aquarius also has an extremely conventional, even conservative side that's in keeping with the symbolism of Saturn, its traditional ruler. Which makes sense, when you think about it; after all, you have to know what the rules are (Saturn) before you can break them (Uranus)!

# Planetary Rulership of Signs


| Sign        | Modern Ruler | Traditional Ruler |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Aries       | Mars         | Mars              |
| Taurus      | Venus        | Venus             |
| Gemini      | Mercury      | Mercury           |
| Cancer      | Moon         | Moon              |
| Leo         | Sun          | Sun               |
| Virgo       | Mercury      | Mercury           |
| Libra       | Venus        | Venus             |
| Scorpio     | Pluto        | Mars              |
| Sagittarius | Jupiter      | Jupiter           |
| Capricorn   | Saturn       | Saturn            |
| Aquarius    | Uranus       | Saturn            |
| Pisces      | Neptune      | Jupiter           |

# General Approach to Life: Modalities

It takes all kinds of people to make a world. Some of us love to start new things, others prefer to nurture what already exists, and some are happiest when bringing things to completion. In the workplace, we might think of them as the executives who look ahead to the future of the organization and formulate goals; the managers who keep track of existing projects and resources; and administrators and workers who produce the work and share it with the rest of the world.

This is a useful analogy for understanding astrological quadruplicities (dividing the zodiac into three groups of four signs each), also known as modalities. Signs of the same modality often have a hard time getting along because they tend to compete with each other, and because each of them represents a different element (fire, earth, air, and water) and therefore a different basic temperament.

# Quadruplicities

Quadruplicities, or modalities, divide the zodiac into three groups of four signs each. Signs of the same quadruplicity tend to compete with each other and have different basic temperaments. The quadruplicities are cardinal (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn), fixed (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius), and mutable (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces).

Think of the executives as representing the cardinal signs—Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. Managers are the fixed signs—Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. And workers are the mutable signs—Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. But this analogy has a flaw. Because executives tend to be paid and otherwise valued much more than other workers, you might imagine I'm implying that cardinal sign people are more important than fixed and mutable sign people. But the truth is much more egalitarian. Each modality plays an essential role in keeping the world running. So imagine a workplace utopia in which the division of labor is distinct, but in which each contributor is equally valued and everyone collects the same salary.

# Cardinal Signs

The cardinal signs—Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn—symbolize initiative, the impulse to break new ground and keep civilization forever moving in new directions. These signs represent the cardinal points of the compass: Aries is east (where the Sun rises), Capricorn is south (where the Sun reaches its highest point in the day), Libra is west (where the Sun sets), and Cancer is north (where the Sun reaches its nadir around midnight).

**Definition**

Cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn), first signs of each season, are signs of initiative and leadership.

The cardinal signs initiate the change of seasons, with the Sun entering Aries at the vernal equinox (spring), Cancer at the summer solstice, Libra at the autumnal equinox, and Capricorn at the winter solstice. Those born with cardinal signs prominent in their birth charts (planets, the Ascendant, or the Midheaven in these signs) are happiest when they're doing anything new. Whether it's exploring uncharted geography, starting a family, beginning a partnership, or founding a business, the cardinal signs love to begin a new venture.

The cardinal signs also enjoy the challenge of claiming territory. For Aries, it may be actual, physical territory. For Cancer, it may be claiming the territory of a home and family unit. For Libra, it's claiming "my marriage"; for Capricorn, the founding of "my company." Come to think of it, "my" is a popular word among cardinal sign people. And wherever you find cardinal signs in your own birth chart, you tend to be an initiator—and a bit territorial as well.

The drawback of cardinal signs is a tendency to start more things than you can possibly finish. Most of us don't have the luxury of delegating all the boring, messy details of life to others. In the real world, you have to show some follow-through on what you've started, or risk ending up with a reputation for being long on promises and short on delivery.

# Fixed Signs

The Sun is in the fixed signs—Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius—during the second month of each season. These signs symbolize the human need to create stability and order in the wake of change. Fixed signs are the zodiac's organizers. Taurus organizes resources, especially physical resources. Leo organizes creative ideas. Scorpio organizes shared resources. And Aquarius organizes people into groups and communities.

**Definition**

Fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius), second signs of each season, are signs of stability and organization.

Those born with fixed signs prominent in their birth charts seem to have a knack for more mundane kinds of organization as well. They love file folders and databases and those little dividers you place in a desk drawer to keep your pens and paper clips organized. They have a knack for knowing just how to approach a task to make sure it's accomplished in the most efficient manner. A cardinal sign person can cry out, "Hey kids—let's put on a show in the barn!" and be confident in the knowledge that their fixed sign brethren will set to work hiring writers, actors, and set designers and raising the money to make sure everyone gets paid.

The fixity of these signs can be a gift, but can also have drawbacks, such as a tendency toward stubbornness and intractability. Fixed signs like the challenge of managing existing routines with ever more efficiency, rather than starting new enterprises or finding new ways of doing things. They can have trouble delegating duties and can have a very hard time seeing other points of view.

# Mutable Signs

The Sun is in mutable signs—Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces—in the last month of each season. These are the months when the work of each season is brought to completion and planning begins for the next. Those born with a heavy mutable sign emphasis in their birth chart are not particularly interested in spearheading new ventures or dealing with the day-to-day challenges of organization and management. Mutable signs excel at performing tasks and producing outcomes.

Mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces), the third signs of each season, are signs of flexibility and finishing things.

Mutable sign folks are happiest brainstorming with colleagues, making sales pitches to clients, tackling piles of invoices, setting up meetings, and planning parties. If there were no mutable sign people, your great idea and well-organized office space would be for naught—because nothing would ever get produced and there would be no one to share the ideas and products with the rest of the world.

On the downside, mutable signs can be undependable, lacking in initiative, and disorganized. Think of when you were finishing your last week of high school, when what we liked to call "senioritis" swept your class. When you've got one foot out the door, there's an itchy restlessness and an unwillingness to buckle down to the task at hand. Sometimes a heavy mutable sign emphasis results in a chronic inability to commit—to a job, a relationship, or even to a set of values.

# Qualities of Temperament: Elements

Each sign also belongs to a triplicity associated with one of the four classical elements found in nature: fire, earth, air, and water. Each triplicity contains a cardinal, fixed, and mutable sign.

In nature, some elements are naturally compatible while others are not. In astrology, signs of the same element tend to get along well with each other because they share the same temperamental quality and feed off one another's energy. Additionally, signs of the water and earth elements tend to get along, just as water nourishes the earth and the earth provides a container for water. Air and fire are also compatible, as when a strong breeze fans the flames of your beach bonfire. Astrological compatibility is a lot more complex than just comparing elements, but it's a great place to start.

> **Definition**
>
> Triplicities divide the zodiac into four groups of three signs each. Each triplicity represents one of the natural elements of fire, earth, air, and water. Signs of the same triplicity have similar temperaments and are compatible.

## Fire Signs

The fire signs are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. Dynamic and passionate, with strong leadership ability, these signs generate enormous warmth and vibrancy. They're exciting to be around, because they're genuinely enthusiastic and usually friendly. But like the element for which they're named, they can either be harnessed into helpful energy or flame up and cause destruction.

Confident and opinionated, fire signs are fond of declarative statements such as "I will do this" or "It's this way." A fire sign that's out of control—usually because they're bored, or have not been acknowledged—can be bossy, demanding, and even tyrannical. But at their best, their confidence and vision inspire us to conquer new territory in the world, in society, and in ourselves.

How fire signs complement one another:

* Aries, a cardinal sign, starts the fire.
* Leo, a fixed sign, tends the fire.
* Sagittarius, a mutable sign, shares the fire.
* You'll learn more about the fire signs in Chapter 4.

# Earth Signs

The earth signs are Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. They are considered practical, reliable stewards of the earth's resources. Like earth, they can provide structure and protection, but earthquakes and landslides can extinguish fire and air and obstruct the flow of water.

Earth signs are oriented toward practical experience and think in terms of doing rather than thinking, feeling, or imagining. An earth sign might say, "That works/doesn't work for me." When they're out of balance, earth signs can be materialistic, unimaginative, and resistant to change. At their best, though, they provide the practical resources, analysis, and leadership to make dreams come true.

How earth signs complement one another:

* Taurus, a fixed sign, gathers and organizes resources.
* Virgo, a mutable sign, makes something from them.
* Capricorn, a cardinal sign, turns them into something else.

You'll learn more about the earth signs in Chapter 5.



Water and earth signs are compatible because they nourish and provide structure for one another.

Fire and air signs get along because they inspire and encourage one another.

# Air Signs

The air signs are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. Sociable and communicative, these are considered the relational signs. Gemini rules casual relationships, Libra rules committed partnership among equals, and Aquarius rules friendship and group associations.

Air signs are oriented more toward thinking than feeling. Like their air element, air signs carry information and the seeds of ideas; but air can blow out fire, create violent dust storms, and evaporate water or stir up deadly waves. Air signs are fond of phrases such as "I think" or "I hear you." Out of balance, they live in their heads and can be insensitive to the feelings of others. But at their best, air signs help us form connections in all spheres of our daily lives.

How air signs complement one another:

* Gemini, a mutable sign, is skilled at making acquaintances and connecting people with one another.
* Libra, a cardinal sign, chooses from among casual acquaintances and initiates committed relationships.
* Aquarius, a fixed sign, builds on relationships to provide social organizations and networks.

You'll learn more about the air signs in Chapter 6.

# Water Signs

The water signs are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. Empathetic and sensitive, they are considered emotionally and psychically gifted. Water dissolves and blends almost all matter, and water signs seem able to connect empathetically with other people. They are sensitive, private, and sentimental. Water signs can say something like "I feel your pain" and be absolutely sincere.

Because they're so sensitive and vulnerable, water signs—like the creatures that symbolize them—develop strong defenses. It takes time to gain the trust of a water sign and to really get to know the person.

Out of balance, water signs are ruled by emotion, lack objectivity, and are too defensive to get close to other people. But at their best, water signs help us nourish, protect, and grow the interpersonal connections that give life meaning.

How water signs complement one another:

* Cancer, a cardinal sign, forms primary tribal units for protection.
* Scorpio, a fixed sign, protects the unit.
* Pisces, a mutable sign, brings new people into the tribe.

You'll learn more about the water signs in Chapter 7.

# Essential Takeaways

* Each sign is represented somewhere in your birth chart.
* Each sign is associated with one or more planetary rulers.
* The modalities, or quadruplicities, group the signs of the zodiac into three groups that share a common approach to life: cardinal, fixed, and mutable.
* The elements, or triplicities, group the signs into four groups that are characterized by the qualities of temperament of the classic natural elements: fire, earth, air, and water.
