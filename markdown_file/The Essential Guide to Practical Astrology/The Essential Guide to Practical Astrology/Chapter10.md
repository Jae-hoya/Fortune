## Getting Grounded: Succedent Houses

The succedent houses: second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh

Each succedent house is associated with one of the fixed signs

The second house: money, possessions, and personal values

The fifth house: creativity, recreation, and children

The eighth house: intimate relationships and shared resources

The eleventh house: friends, groups, and future legacy

You've just started a new job, moved to a new house, gotten married, or lost a substantial amount of weight. The shape of your daily landscape has radically changed. What's your next step?

Getting grounded.

You establish new routines. You assess what you have and make a list of what you need. You buy new clothes, or decorate your house or workspace in a way that makes you comfortable and reflects your personality. You negotiate with your partner about the best way to merge your possessions, money, and friends. You figure out how to express your individuality in a new environment, and work to develop alliances based on shared goals.

The succedent houses are associated with the fixed signs of the zodiac, and these are the houses that represent the processes that lend stability and security to our lives, our relationships, and even our society. In them, you amass possessions (second house), learn to use them creatively (fifth house), share them with others (eighth house), and use them to contribute to society’s future (eleventh house). These houses represent the cornerstones in the foundation of your life.

# Second House: Collect What You Need

Close your eyes, and imagine you're in a completely safe, comfortable place. You have everything you need; you're not worried about where your next paycheck or meal will come from. You have good health, affectionate relationships, great hair, and a fabulous figure.

Where are you? What are you doing? Are you lying in a hammock between two palm trees, gazing out at the ocean while you sip a cool beverage? Sitting serenely at the top of a craggy mountain, enjoying a breathtaking view? Lying on your back on a meadow, watching puffy clouds in an azure sky?

Now open your eyes. Welcome back … you've just visited your second house—a place where no one goes without or feels threatened or alone.

The second house was traditionally called the "House of Money." Without taking anything away from money (in the real world, most of us find it handy, if not essential), it has no intrinsic worth. Its worth lies in what it represents: resources, and the ability to exchange them for other resources. So the second house is about your relationship with money, but it's also about what you consider valuable. If you grew up without enough food to eat, you probably value a hearty meal and a full pantry. If you were raised to think your physical appearance is your most important asset, you'll value good grooming and an attractive wardrobe. If you were born into wealth, you might value a friend who likes you for something other than your money.

What you value is connected to the resources you have available, and the second house symbolizes not just your our attitude about possessions, personal comfort, and security, but also the natural resources of personality, gifts, and character that you bring to the table. The challenge of navigating the second house is to use all of your resources wisely, and to cultivate a relationship to the physical world that reflects what's truly important to you—to avoid ending up being someone who, as Oscar Wilde once said, knows "the cost of everything and the value of nothing."

# Rulerships and Key Concepts

The second house is associated with the second sign of the zodiac, Taurus, and its ruling planet, Venus. Like Taurus, it's of the fixed quality and the earth element.

Key concepts of the second house: Money, resources, contentment, security, property, banks, gardens, farms, coins

# Signs

The second house shares a lot of territory and concerns with the sign of Taurus. In your chart, the second house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the second house cusp and signs contained in the second house
* Planets in the second house
* The planet that rules the sign on the second house cusp

**Aries in the second house** — You value action, initiative, and enterprise, and your greatest resources are courage, energy, and daring. Impulsive in your spending, you're a financial risk taker. You're willing to do whatever it takes to get money or anything else you need for your comfort and security. You have an entrepreneurial spirit and do best when your pay is directly based on your own initiative (such as through bonuses and commission).

**Taurus in the second house** — You value stability, practicality, and comfort, and your greatest resources are patience, tenacity, and a calm temperament. You like things and can be rather possessive about your stuff; you take good care of your property and finances. However, you have a weakness for easy money and can sometimes be taken in by get-rich-quick schemes.

## Gemini in the second house

You value intellect, variety, and curiosity, and your greatest resources are your wit, adaptability, and open mind. You're not materialistic, but you're fascinated by money, reading spreadsheets for fun and spending a lot of time thinking and talking about financial matters. You prefer to have at least two sources of income, and you're always looking for new ways to increase your earnings.

## Cancer in the second house

You value safety, family connections, and your home; your greatest resources are your caring nature, tenacity, and ability to connect with others emotionally. Money and possessions are emotional territory for you; they represent safety and security. You don't part with money easily, but can be generous with immediate family and close friends (though you're easily hurt if you don't feel appreciated). Your caution may prevent you from earning a lot of money, but you're an accomplished saver.

## Leo in the second house

You value fun, creativity, and appearances, and your greatest resources are your charisma, loyalty, and dependability. You're a bit of a big spender; you love to pick up the check at restaurants, loathe cheapness, and are impatient with talk of budgets, bargains, and coupon clipping. You're generous, especially with the children in your life, and you have a touch of the gambler in you.

## Virgo in the second house

You value prudence, efficiency, and quality, and your best resources are discrimination, analytical ability, and the ability to figure out how things work. You're fascinated with the efficient use of resources; nothing makes you happier than finding a great deal or developing ways to lower your electric bill. You abhor waste and prefer to spend money on things that will last, instead of expensive dinners and vacations.

## Signs in the Second House Go Shopping

* Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) are impulse spenders. They spend because it feels good!
* Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) are practical spenders. They're generally frugal and spend because that's the only way to get what they want.
* Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) are relational spenders. They spend on the people in their lives, or because of peer pressure.
* Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) are emotional spenders. They spend to make themselves feel better.

## Libra in the second house

You value relationships, beauty, and fairness; your finest resources are refinement, diplomacy, and good judgment. You'll spend money on beautiful things and on pampering services, but only after an exhaustive search to find exactly what you want. It's not easy for you to make financial decisions, and you rely on your partner to help you decide on purchases and investments. You're gifted at marketing and can usually develop sources of passive income, such as royalties.

## Scorpio in the second house

You value loyalty, passion, and intimacy; your greatest resources are your passion, intuition, and trustworthiness. You value money only as a means of maintaining control over your own life. Scorpio is the sign of "other people's money," and you have excellent instincts about investments and are very talented at making money for other people.

## Sagittarius in the second house

You value freedom, honesty, and adventure; your greatest resources are your vision, independence, and understanding. For you, money is a means of securing your freedom. You're generous, mostly because you don't care much about money. You tend to wander into financially lucrative situations, which is perhaps why you have a trusting and optimistic attitude about money.

## Capricorn in the second house

You value responsibility, success, and maturity; your greatest resources are pragmatism, persistence, and self-reliance. You're haunted by fears of poverty and deprivation, and you don't trust anyone else to provide for you. Because of this fear, you can be tight-fisted with your money. However, you can often build up a substantial empire, or at least a nest egg, because you're frugal, resourceful, and determined to get ahead financially.

## Aquarius in the second house

You value freedom, friendship, and equality, and your best resources are sociability, stamina, and innovation. You find the subject of money intellectually stimulating, particularly financial markets and long-range financial planning. Your income tends to fluctuate, often because you're drawn to careers like consulting or contract assignments that allow you more control over your schedule. You're generous with friends and with your favorite charitable organizations.

## Pisces in the second house

You value art, social welfare, and imagination; your best resources are your kindness, popularity, and adaptability. You find financial management tedious and can be trusting and impractical when it comes to money, with an "easy come, easy go" attitude about possessions. You'll give help to anyone who needs it, and you trust that if you ever need help, it will be forthcoming.

# Fifth House: Create, Express, Play

To understand the fifth house, think for a moment about mid evening, when the Sun moves through the fifth house each day. This is the time of day after dinner is finished but before bedtime, a time when we give ourselves over to leisure and recreation, watching television, playing a video game, going out to hear a concert. On weekends, it's the time when things really begin to heat up, with parties hitting their stride and the headlining act taking the stage.

The fifth house symbolizes the urge to play. It's where you find leisure, playful enjoyment, and the expression of creative energy. But the leisurely tone of the fifth house is not just about recreation, any more than a child at play is simply having fun; unstructured time offers opportunities for exploring fresh ideas and approaches that inform a creative, stimulating Part 3: A Place for Everything: Houses approach to life. The fifth is a storytelling house. In the same way children play make believe to try on various roles, the fifth house symbolizes the act of crafting a compelling vision of who you are. Imagination is one of mankind's most precious resources, and it first rears its head in the fifth house.

The fifth house was traditionally called the "House of Children," and in an earlier era children were considered important practical resources, providing labor and caretaking. Children hold a different position in the modern family, and the fifth house has increasingly become associated with fun, play, and self-expression. It's the house of transforming your resources into something that didn't exist before, except in your imagination. It's a house of gambling, of using up resources on games or the stock market, or the thrill of creating something that may not pay off in practical dividends. When a kid salvages an old wooden box and some wheels and builds a box cart with them, those resources are no longer available for other, more practical uses. But the return on his investment of time and materials is the thrill of hurdling down the steepest hill in town on his very own magic carpet.

# Rulerships and Key Concepts

The fifth house is associated with Leo, the fifth sign of the zodiac, and its ruler, the Sun. Like Leo, the fifth house belongs to the fixed quality and the fire element.

Key concepts of the fifth house : children, creativity, performance, self-expression, gaming, recreation, fun, romantic relationships that are committed

# Signs
The fifth house shares a lot of territory with the sign of Leo. In your chart, the fifth house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the fifth house cusp and signs contained in the fifth house
* Planets in the fifth house
* The planet that rules the sign on the fifth house cusp

## Aries in the fifth house

You love a creative challenge and push hard to develop your talents and get them noticed. If you have children, you'll push them hard to reach their potential. Your idea of a good time is to exerting yourself physically or creatively; you're a bit of a lone wolf, preferring leisure activities that allow you to move at your own pace. Passionately romantic, you love the thrill of the romantic chase.

## Taurus in the fifth house

You love music, the arts, dinner parties with good friends, and generally living the good life. You adore children and create stable, affectionate environments for them. Sentimental in love, you favor old-fashioned expressions of affection. You enjoy games of all kinds and enjoy being outdoors, but aren't usually strenuously athletic. You can get a little stuck in the same old recreational grooves, however, and benefit from friends who can nudge you out of your comfort zone.

## Gemini in the fifth house

Good conversation, reading, and writing are your favorite forms of recreation. You have little patience with the long, rambling, repetitive stories of young children, but are a favorite confidant of teens because you listen and speak to them on their level. You're astonishingly creative, generally good at writing, playing an instrument, painting, or acting, and are restless without tasks, handcrafts, or puzzles to keep your busy mind occupied.

## Cancer in the fifth house

You have a gift for touching people's hearts with your creative gifts; you're a natural artist, whether painting a landscape or creating a delicious meal, but are a bit shy of the spotlight. You're wild about kids of all ages, shapes, sizes, and temperaments. You're not good at dating—you get attached too quickly and get your heart broken a lot; but once in a committed relationship you keep the romance alive. You rarely relax; taking care of your loved ones is a full time job.

# Leo in the fifth house

You're a natural, joyful, unselfconscious performer—you're good at everything, and you make it all look easy. You love children and are good at joining them in their play and helping them develop their own creativity. You fall in love like other people breathe and genuinely enjoy dating, socializing, and parties. You have a zest for enjoying life, and others gravitate to you to try to catch some of your magic.

# Virgo in the fifth house

You're an artisan, a craftsperson whom others look to as a standard bearer. You're your own worst critic, so many of your creative projects never see the light of day. You have a romantic heart but impossible standards; you hate dating and are uncomfortable at parties. You dislike the noise and messiness of children, though you're a gentle parent to kids of your own. You adore animals and the outdoors, and your ideal vacation would enjoy camping, hiking, or just exploring some lovely place and its wildlife.

# Pets: Animals … or Children?

In traditional astrology, household pets were associated with the sixth house, along with beasts of burden and the animals that tend to show up on your dinner plate. Some astrologers feel that modern pets, the kind who wear cunning outfits and are spoiled rotten, are more appropriately placed in the fifth house with the rest of the children in our lives. My own experience is that the sixth house of my chart describes my pets better than the fifth house; then again, I think my cats are cute enough wearing only fur.

# Libra in the fifth house

You have a tremendous gift for beauty. A natural musician or painter, you also have a great gift for creating beautiful environments and helping others beautify themselves. A romantic marriage is crucially important to you; you’re the type to have date nights even after you’re married and have specific ideas about how your partner should observe special occasions, often picking out your own gifts. Your children are taught to be well mannered and charming, but you prefer to vacation with your partner alone.

# Scorpio in the fifth house

You're passionately creatively, favoring art that is a bit disturbing or confronts taboos. You're secretive about your creative projects, and people often never know how talented you are until suddenly, one day, you've written a book or invented some fantastic gadget that makes you rich. You're great with your children when they're young but can have power struggles with teenagers. You're hopeless at relaxing, but approaching some challenge with intensity and focus is great fun for you.

# Sagittarius in the fifth house

A creative visionary, you're always at least one step ahead of everyone else. You think big and always reach for the widest possible audience. You're bighearted with your children and encourage their education and life experiences, but often feel that children tie you down from doing what you'd like to be doing. Travel and spending time outdoors are your favorite pastimes.

# Capricorn in the fifth house

You don't create anything without harboring the ambition of being the very best—and usually you reach that goal, becoming respected for your creative efforts. You're inclined to be a hands-off parent, as long as your children perform well in school and don't create discipline problems. "Fun" is a bit of an alien concept to you; to you, work is more fun than anything else.

# Aquarius in the fifth house

You have the popular touch in whatever you create and are able to connect with a large audience without sacrificing your uniqueness. You tend to relate to children as a friend, and are an excellent step- or foster parent. You enjoy having a houseful of people, and parties or group activities with friends are your favorite form of fun .

# Pisces in the fifth house
You have a lyrical, poetic creative sensibility and are a natural musician, dancer, or poet; art is an escape for you, and you need a lot of quiet time alone to devote yourself to creativity. You love children and enjoy leading them in play and in art projects; you're a soft touch, and as a parent you need a partner who is willing to be the disciplinarian. You have a good time all the time, but especially enjoy spending time near the water.

# Eighth House: Urge to Merge
Before I got married, my therapist asked me how well I thought I knew my husband-to-be. "Pretty well," I answered. "We were close friends for a full year before we ever got involved romantically." She thought about that for a moment. "April," she said, "You never truly know another person until you share a bank account with them."

She was right, of course. In the seventh house you meet and fall in love with someone who fits your particular psychological schema, and make serious, public promises about sticking it out together until you die. But the eighth house, traditionally called the "House of Other People's Money," symbolizes the next step in relationship, when things get really interesting. The process of pooling resources—including money, possessions, secrets, and bodily fluids—makes you utterly vulnerable. Without this complete openness to another person, you can't really be intimate.

If your seventh house powers of judgment have served you well, and you've chosen a partner with complementary abilities and values, merging your resources makes each of you stronger. The process of setting up house (or a business) together is a delicate one, exploring the limits of our trust, but the end result is greater and stronger than the sum of its parts.

# Rulerships and Key Concepts
The eighth house is associated with Scorpio, the eighth sign of the zodiac, and its ruler, Pluto. Like Scorpio, the eighth house belongs to the fixed quality and the water element.

Key concepts of the eighth house: Shared resources, including joint bank accounts with a partner, investments, insurance, and taxes; death, particularly in the sense of submerging individual identity to a partnership; sexual relationships.

# Signs

The eighth house shares a lot of territory and symbolism with the sign of Scorpio. In your chart, the eighth house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the eighth house cusp and signs contained in the eighth house
* Planets in the eighth house
* The sign and house placement of the planet that rules the sign on the eighth house cusp

**Aries and the eighth house**—The sign of individuality is an uncomfortable fit with the house of shared resources. Aries enjoys the sexual dimension of the eighth house, but doesn't generally enjoy sharing turf or mingling resources. Merging with another person is unlikely to be a smooth process for you; you don't like conferring with someone before spending money or painting the living room. You do best with someone who is independent, and it may be a good idea to keep your finances separate.

**Taurus in the eighth house**—You tend to get attached to your stuff, and you want things your own way. Still, you're inclined to be generous with your partner unless it's obvious they're not going to carry their own weight. Fortunately, you have a gift for attracting partners who are financially secure and who are dedicated to your ease and comfort.

# Gemini in the eighth house

From an early age, you're interested in sex, death, and emotional intrigue. People tell you their secrets, and though you love to gossip you're astonishingly good at honoring individual confidences. You're only comfortable becoming intimate with someone who doesn't smother you and who is interesting to talk to; if you stray in a relationship it's because you're bored mentally, not physically.

# Cancer in the eighth house

You loathe talking about sex and money; these are intensely private matters to you, and you have to know and trust someone very much indeed to wade into these waters with them. You feel terribly vulnerable relying on someone else for your financial security, and are rarely promiscuous because once you've had sex with someone you become immediately emotionally attached.

# Leo in the eighth house

You might as well have been born a Scorpio, because you live for the mystery and sexual intrigue symbolized by the eighth house. You're intensely loyal, financially reliable, and generous with your intimate partners—but you can also be kind of bossy, because you're convinced your way of dealing with money, sex, or anything else is the only way!

# Virgo in the eighth house

You often seem to end up in intimate relationships in which you and your partner are not contributing equally. There can, in fact, be the sense that one partner has to sacrifice a considerable amount in order to support the other. There is often a powerful sexual component that sustains the relationship.

# Libra in the eighth house

Fairness and equality are essential to you, and in a relationship you need to feel both parties are contributing equally and sharing the decisions about joint resources. You enjoy sexual intimacy most within a committed relationship; you may also create art that has mystical, sexual, or death-related themes.

The eighth house seems to be less connected to your own death than to the role of mortality in your life. Fascination with death is certainly eighth house territory, as is the "death" of individual ego that's necessary to become really intimate with another person.

## Scorpio in the eighth house

Sexual intimacy, loyalty, and shared resources are deadly serious to you. Someone who betrays you in any of these areas will never get a second chance.

## Sagittarius in the eighth house

Intimacy, for you, requires only fairness, honesty, and freedom. You can't bear feeling tied down or hemmed in by a partner, and at the first hint of manipulation or dishonesty you're out the door.

## Capricorn in the eighth house

You fear debt and hate to owe anybody money, so you're frugal and always live with your means. There's a sense of having to rely on yourself because others seem to let you down or rely on you to provide for them.

## Aquarius in the eighth house

This is the original commune/hippie/1960s ethos of sharing resources communally and taking a free-love approach to sexual intimacy. It's a utopian ideal that works well on a kibbutz but may get you into tight spots with more conventional or possessive types.

## Pisces in the eighth house

Generous both emotionally and financially, you can often find yourself overextended in both areas. You're fond of giving away your possessions, regularly purging your home and giving things away. You always assume that somehow there will be enough and you'll be taken care of, and usually you're right!

# Eleventh House: Touch the Future
I used to love the television program Northern Exposure. Set in the tiny fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, it offered a warm and heartfelt (if somewhat idealized) depiction of small-town life. In a small town, everyone knows everyone else and has distinctive characteristics and eccentricities. In Cicely, a retired astronaut, a big-city doctor, a woman pilot, a May-December couple of restaurateurs, and many other disparate characters found a way to get along, mostly because their survival depended on it—not just the survival of Alaska's extreme weather and rugged topography, but the survival of isolation from other people.

With a traditional name of the "House of Friendship" (but I prefer to think of it as a house of community), the eleventh house moves you beyond the eighth house challenge of merging your resources with one other person and into the realm of contributing to large-scale efforts that provide social stability. Government is one example of eleventh house collectivism, but so are social or political movements that join groups of people in opposition to the status quo. Like the unlikely bedfellows of Cicely, Alaska, societies are formed when individuals marshal their resources to achieve common aims.

Eleventh house territory transports you beyond the present and your own smallness and allows you to touch the future—to leave the legacy of a dream realized. Whether it's a corporation, an invention, a scientific breakthrough, or the constitution for a fledgling democracy, a legacy is not something that can be created alone; it's a collaboration between you and the society in which you live. What people create together from their combined resources is what survives long after they're gone. Even a painting created by a brilliant artist is not a legacy until it's embraced by an audience.

# Rulerships and Key Concepts

The eleventh house is associated with Aquarius, the eleventh house of the zodiac, and its rulers, Uranus and Saturn. Like Uranus, the eleventh house belongs to the fixed quality and the air element.

# Key concepts of the eleventh house

Friendship, social organizations, groups, politics, income from career

# Signs

The eleventh house shares similar territory with the sign of Aquarius. In your chart, the eleventh house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the eleventh house cusp and signs contained in the eleventh house
* Planets in the eleventh house
* The sign and house placement of the planet that rules the sign on the eleventh house cusp

## Aries in the eleventh house

You're not really a joiner and don't really gravitate toward existing groups or organizations—though you might start some. You're a leader among your friends and have a knack for motivating people to take action, and if you do get drawn into an organization you're likely to be made president. Pioneering is your legacy.

## Taurus in the eleventh house

You're drawn to artistic people and organizations, or those celebrating "the good life"—epicureans, country clubs, wine-tasting groups. You are likely to earn considerable wealth from a career you find meaningful, making it possible you could leave a significant philanthropic legacy.

## Gemini in the eleventh house

You seem to know everyone; you're a one-person social network. You're drawn to networking organizations or groups that help improve communication skills; within an organization you're a secretary or newsletter editor. Yours is a legacy of information.

## Cancer in the eleventh house

You're especially drawn to organizations that are devoted to the causes of women, children, the hungry, and the homeless.

Your friends are carefully chosen, because you hang onto them for life. Others feel you really understand them; empathy is your legacy.

# Leo in the eleventh house

First among equals, you're a rock star among your friends and are drawn to organizations that celebrate creativity, artistic expression, children, and performance. You inspire others to explore their own creative side; creative expression is your legacy.

# Virgo in the eleventh house

Passionately devoted to environmental causes, animal rights, and health (especially reproductive health), you're drawn to organizations that want to improve the health of the planet and all those who live on it. You'll offer any practical assistance you can to a cause you believe in; service is your legacy.

The eleventh house was traditionally called the "House of Friendship." However, your very closest friends are the purview of the seventh house. Eleventh house friends tend to run in packs—groups of people bound by common interests and circumstance, like your local astrology group or the gang of work friends who get together for Friday happy hour.

# Libra in the eleventh house

You're adept at getting along with others and making friends, but you strongly feel that friendship is a two-way street and won't waste time with people who don't make an effort. You're more interested in one-on-one relationships than groups, but you are committed to social justice, human rights, and arts-related organizations. Yours is a legacy of harmony.

# Scorpio in the eleventh house

You don't shy away from troubled people or difficult issues, and you're a loyal friend. You're drawn to organizations that help victims of sexual abuse or torture, and those that are connected to weapons, including guns and nuclear weaponry. Your willingness to confront taboos and expose horrors makes yours a legacy of truth telling.

# Sagittarius in the eleventh house

Your friends reflect a wide range of backgrounds, beliefs, and cultures. You don't much care for groups, but you're vocal about education, religion, and cultural issues. You don't insist that your friends believe exactly as you do, so long as they believe strongly in something and their beliefs are based on a sound philosophy. Your legacy is one of understanding and tolerance.

# Capricorn in the eleventh house

Your friends are often older or younger than you are, and intergenerational concerns figure prominently in your sense of community involvement. You're the elder of your tribe, the mother or father figure, and the keeper of the ethical flame. Your friends are those you work with and who share your cause, and your tireless work for your community is a legacy of achievement.

# Aquarius in the eleventh house

Friends and organizations are vital to your sense of well-being. You like your autonomy, but you are happiest when you exercise your independence within a larger communal framework of family, friends, workplace, church, or career. You have strong opinions and are often part of the radical, polarizing edges of any group. Yours is a legacy of community.

# Pisces in the eleventh house

Your enormous number of friends are drawn from your varied interests in music, dance, social causes, and spirituality. Your charm and ability to take others as they are makes you a beloved friend and a welcome addition to any group or organization. You are interested in peace and human rights, and your support of groups that advocate in these areas is your legacy of love.
