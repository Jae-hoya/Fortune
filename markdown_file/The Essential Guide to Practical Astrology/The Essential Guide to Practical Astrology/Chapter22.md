## Bringing It All Together

Learning a language is challenging. Still, if you apply yourself, you can probably be reading People magazine in a second language within a year. As a language, astrology has a similar learning curve. It can take time to make the leap from understanding astrology when you read it in a book to knowing how to apply it to real world situations. Furthermore, you may decide that what you've learned in the other parts of this book are enough for you. You know how to recognize planetary placements in your chart, look them up, and get some insights about them. That's a great place to start, and for many, that's where the journey will end.

If you want to become fluent in the language, however, the final part of the book journeys into more complicated territory: using astrology to see into the future. These chapters offer a taste of how the discrete elements of astrology can be combined to reveal a portrait of a real, complex person, and how to peer into the future and make out the landscape that lies ahead.

Astrology has the capacity for lyricism and deep insight. But writers who created great works of art (War and Peace, the Old Testament, Friends) didn't leap from learning the alphabet one day to sitting down at a typewriter (or Dead Sea Scrolls, as the case may be) the next, ready to dazzle the world. First, they had to master a language. There were hours spent singing that wearisome alphabet song and listening to teachers drone on about grammar, punctuation, and composition, before they ever got to that neat stuff about Napoleon's invasion of Russia and the tortured romance between Ross and Rachel.

But before you can dazzle your friends with your astrological insights, you have to learn the language. I won't lie to you—there's a bit of a learning curve. This book has given you the tools, but you have to learn to wield them with skill and authority. This chapter is designed to walk you through some basic rules of astrological grammar, and to give you an example of what it might look like when you take all these disparate symbols and use them to cobble together an astrological profile of an actual person.

# A Review of the Astrological Alphabet
As I discussed in Chapter 2, astrology is built on a group of basic symbols that act as shorthand for some reasonably complex concepts. The signs of the zodiac, like your ABCs, follow an established order from Aries to Pisces and are often represented by glyphs instead of their names. Each sign corresponds with a house of the horoscope and to one or more planets, which also have their own glyphs, as summarized in the following table.

| Sign        | Glyph | House    | Planet(s)        | Glyph |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Aries       | ♈     | First    | Mars             | ♂     |
| Taurus      | ♉     | Second   | Venus            | ♀     |
| Gemini      | ♊     | Third    | Mercury          | ☿     |
| Cancer      | ♋     | Fourth   | Moon             | ☽     |
| Leo         | ♌     | Fifth    | Sun              | ☉     |
| Virgo       | ♍     | Sixth    | Mercury          | ☿     |
| Libra       | ♎     | Seventh  | Venus            | ♀     |
| Scorpio     | ♏     | Eighth   | Pluto, Mars      | ♇, ♂  |
| Sagittarius | ♐     | Ninth    | Jupiter          | ♃     |
| Capricorn   | ♑     | Tenth    | Saturn           | ♄     |
| Aquarius    | ♒     | Eleventh | Uranus, Saturn   | ♅, ♄  |
| Pisces      | ♓     | Twelfth  | Neptune, Jupiter | ♆, ♃  |

It's not that a sign means exactly the same things as its corresponding house or planets; it's just that there is sympathy among them, and a lot of territory in common. A doctor, a hospital room, and a white coat and stethoscope aren't the same things, but they all have something to do with health care. Likewise, the sign Taurus, the second house, and Venus all have something to do with pleasure.

This commonality becomes important to understand when you begin mixing and matching elements from different categories. Going back to our doctor example, health care providers come in different forms (doctor, nurse, dentist, veterinarian), can look or dress in a variety of ways (male, female, white coat, surgical scrubs), and might work in a variety of settings (hospital, clinic, a tent in Korea). M*A*S*H's Hawkeye Pierce wearing surgical scrubs in a mobile army surgical hospital is a vastly different image from that of a nurse of the same era in a conventional hospital, wearing a crisp white hat. But they're both in the health care business.

Likewise, Venus (the concept of pleasure) can come in a variety of forms (attractive person, candy bar, lingerie, currency), look a certain way (blonde, nougaty, lacy, small bills), and be found in a variety of settings (across a crowded room, in a vending machine, Victoria's Secret, that jar in the kitchen). So a woman (Venus) who is mature and authoritative (Capricorn) and who works in communication (third house) has a certain amount in common with your boss (Saturn) who sells advertising (Libra) for a magazine (Venus). They’re not the same, but they have enough things in common (authority, work in communication, women’s issues) that they’d probably find something to talk about at a dinner party

# Astrological Grammar

When someone who doesn't know anything about astrology wants to reference it in a "humorous" way, he might say something like, "My Moon is in Uranus." (Astrological humor almost always includes Uranus.) That's an objectionable sentence in many ways, but most importantly, it's poor astrological grammar. Here's why.

# Astrological Nouns

When you learned grammar, you began with nouns. These were the words that did the heavy lifting, the people, places, and things that occupy space and perform actions, the grammatical rock stars around which the rest of the words in a sentence revolved like groupies. In astrology, planets are the nouns. Planets are described as being in signs, in houses, and in aspect to other planets or angles. In other words, a planet appears to be moving through a particular constellation (sign) and part of the sky (house), and in specific geometrical relationships (aspects) with other planets or parts of the sky. For example:

Venus is in Aquarius. This means that the planet Venus is moving through the constellation Aquarius.

Venus is in the first house. That is, the planet Venus is in part of the sky that the Sun occupies just before sunrise.

Venus is trine Saturn. This means the planet Venus is approximately 120 degrees from the planet Saturn. The faster-moving planet is the one that makes the aspect to the slower-moving planet. (If we waited around for Neptune or Pluto to aspect something, we'd be here all day.) Put these concepts together and you get a sentence like this:

# Venus in Aquarius in the first house, trine Saturn.

Planets also rule signs; for example, Mars rules Aries. Before the discovery of Pluto, Mars was also considered the ruler of Scorpio. Most modern astrologers still consider Mars a co-ruler, or traditional ruler, of Scorpio.

To a more limited extent, signs can occasionally serve as nouns. Signs can be in houses:

Capricorn is in the first house. That is, some or all 30 degrees of the sign Capricorn fall between the cusps of the first and second houses.

Signs are also be on house cusps or angles:

Scorpio is on the cusp of the tenth house, or Scorpio is on the Midheaven.

But signs are never in planets, or in other signs. Saying something like "My Virgo is in Mars" is like saying "My yellow is in dress." It doesn't mean anything except that the person who constructed this sentence doesn't speak the language.

# Astrological Adjectives

The signs of the zodiac function as astrology's adjectives, describing the nouns. For example, your girlfriend dresses eccentrically, favoring odd pairings like army boots with a tutu. In this case, your girlfriend is a Venus character (a female) who dresses in an Aquarian (eclectic, surprising) fashion.

# Astrology and the Bard

William Shakespeare's plays were filled with allusions to astrology, which was very popular in Elizabethan England. From King Lear to Romeo, the characters in his plays often expressed themselves in the language of astrology—most famously Cassius in Julius Caesar: “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.'" 

# Astrological Verbs and Adverbs

Planetary movements are astrology's verbs and adverbs, showing action in the sky. The nature of that action is the adverb.

* Planets form aspects to other planets:

Today, Mercury will aspect Pluto.

If you want to give a little more color commentary about the aspect, you could describe the aspect:

Today, Mercury will make a square aspect Pluto, so be on guard for sarcasm.
Or simply: Today, Mercury will square Pluto.

* Planets enter signs or houses, or change direction:

This morning, Mercury entered Sagittarius, quickly followed by my foot entering my mouth.

Look at that—the Moon just left the seventh house and my wife walked out on me!

Before you know it, Mercury will turn retrograde again.
I'm living for the moment when Mercury turns direct!

# Combining Key Concepts

When you start to combine planets, signs, houses, and aspects into complete sentences that make sense, it can be completely overwhelming. This is especially true because astrology is, above all, an interpretive art, so there are a number of ways you can interpret just about any astrological symbol.

With practice, and with a little context about the animal, vegetable, or mineral that you're interpreting, you will eventually get better at this. For now, just get comfortable trying to do it at all. Do it by taking each element step-by-step.

Let's say you want to figure out what it means that your sweetheart was born when Jupiter was in the sign of Libra and in the sixth house. What does it mean?

1. Start with the symbolism of the planet—in this case, Jupiter. What element of your sweetie's character or psyche is under consideration? It's the inner adventurer, seeking new experiences and a broad-reaching understanding of life.

2. Consider the sign that the planet is in. This indicates the style in which he approaches the planet's bailiwick. Libra seeks balance, all things in moderation; prefers to dress beautifully and behave charmingly; dislikes gore and violence; and is preoccupied with relationships. This person prefers a balance of new experiences (Jupiter) and more familiar routines. He prefers to have company in his adventures, and he is wary of adventures that require him to go several days without showering.

3. Consider Jupiter's house placement. Jupiter is in the sixth house, the house of health, work, daily routine, and service. He is most apt to encounter adventure in connection with his work or health, or out of a desire to be of help. He may work in the travel industry, in academia or publishing (adventures of the mind), or in a religious profession (adventures of the spirit). He may perform perfectly ordinary work (sixth house), such as chartered accountancy, in thrilling settings (Jupiter) such as Machu Pichu.

Try one yourself. What would you do with, say, Mars in Virgo in the third house?

Chapter 16 provides a guide to interpreting aspects that is so awesomely comprehensive that it really deserves another look. So flip back and take a gander, then join us back here, won’t you?

# Approaching a Chart

I'll tell you a secret. I've been reading charts for almost four decades, and every time I sit down with a new one—every time without fail—it looks absolutely incomprehensible to me. The symbols swim before my eyes and refuse to hang together into anything cohesive. It's only by taking it slow and methodically, by finding an interesting thread of two and pulling at them, that I'm eventually drawn into the chart.

And I'll tell you another secret. I rarely read charts for people in person anymore, but when I did, the person who walked in the door was always completely different from what I had imagined based on his or her chart. There's an old saying: "the map is not the territory." No matter how good the map, it can't convey the reality of the landscape, and what it really feels like to be there.

Keep an open mind. Remember that symbols can be interpreted in a number of ways, so see the astrology chart as your road map. It will help you get where you need to go, but remember, a real, live person has been doing heavy construction on these roads over the course of a lifetime. There may be potholes and roadblocks that don't show up at all; some roads may have been washed away. So always approach the chart, and the person, with respect, and let them be your guide to understanding the terrain.

# A Systematic Approach

There is no single right way to approach a birth chart. With time and experience, you'll have a good idea of what works for you. But when you're first getting to know the territory, it's helpful to have a systematic approach to reading the map. Here's one way:

* **Context.** First, get what you can from the birth data. When was the person born, and what is his or her current age? What are some possible concerns of someone from that generation at this current stage of life? What do you know about the city, state, region, or country of birth? There's no guarantee that place had a major impact on the person (many families move far away when a child is still very young), but it may have.

(I can hear skeptics squealing, "That's cheating! None of that stuff has anything to do with astrology!" Maybe not, but it has everything to do with context! An astrologer will interpret the chart very differently for a man of marrying age in Nigeria than we would for a 13-year-old girl born and raised in Chicago. Or he or she should, anyway.)

* **Eyeball the chart.** Just look at it in a casual way, without really focusing on the details, as though you're looking at one of those 3-D posters or some cute guy sitting in the corner at Starbucks. Are some houses larger than others? Are there more planets above or below the horizon, or on the left or right side of the chart, or is the whole chart fairly well balanced? Are there clusters of planets in one or more houses? Lots of squares and oppositions in the aspect grid, or more trines and sextiles?

* **Planets on angles.** Take note of any planets that are close—say, within about 10 degrees either side—of the cusps of the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth houses. These planets are considered potent and influential; they symbolize traits and impulses you can't fail to notice, indelible qualities that are part of the person's "personal branding."

* **Aspect the chart.** Although most computer programs will generate a list of planetary aspects, I find it helpful to find the aspects myself and make a grid or list. This process, which is a bit like working a crossword puzzle, really helps me slow down and look at the relationships between the planets. Make a copy of the aspect grid in Chapter 16; start by finding aspects to the Sun, and work your way down the grid.

* **Elements, modality, and dignity.** Notice whether there is an emphasis on planets in one element (fire, earth, air, or water) or modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable). Are there planets that are in the signs of their rulership or exaltation? Or their detriment or fall? These are important guys to look at. (Forgotten about elements and modalities? Backtrack to Chapter 3. Lost your dignities? Chapter 2 is the one you’re looking for.)

# Sun, Moon, and Ascendant

*   **Sun, Moon, and Ascendant.** Break down the Big Three. What is the nature of the person's inner hero (the Sun's sign), and in what area of life (house the Sun is in) does the hero embark on its quest? How does he or she get emotional needs met (Moon's sign and house)? What is the behavioral mask (Ascendant) the world sees?

# The other angles

*   **The other angles.** Examine the signs on the other angles, the cusps of the fourth house (domestic and emotional needs), seventh house (approach to relationships), and tenth house (worldly calling and profession). Where is this person coming from? What's his or her calling? What kind of partner is needed to balance the personality that is on display in the first house? If you get stuck, take a look at chapters 9 through 11.

# Other stuff

*   **Other stuff.** Interpret other chart features, including signs on house cusps, planets in houses and in signs, and planets in aspect to other planets. Do this enough, and before you know it you'll hardly need to flip back and forth through this or any other book. You'll memorize the symbols; you'll internalize them. And when you do, all the mystifying symbols will fly together into a cohesive portrait. You'll have an intuitive feel for which factors outweigh others.

> Astro Tip: To test whether you've spent enough time looking at the chart in depth, follow this tip from astrologer Diane Ronngren: Turn over the sheet of paper with the chart on it, and see whether you can draw it from memory. If you can't, spend a little more time peering into its inscrutable little symbols and then try again.

# Sample Analysis: The Princess

To give you an example of how I might use those guidelines to examine a birth chart, I give you "The Princess." Born February 22, 1975 at 11:51 a.m. In Culver City, California, this young lady is now in her mid-30s. She's a member of Generation X, which came of age in the 1990s and brought us such cultural touchstones as grunge music, video games, the Internet, and $4 cappuccinos. It's a generation that has seen its share of divorced parents, stepfamilies, and ever-shifting domestic boundaries; many GenXers either put off marriage indefinitely for fear of recreating the marital disasters of the previous generation, or else work doubly hard to make their own relationships work. They also tend to have a fairly fluid approach to gender roles, and as a generation tend to take unconventional relationships and alternative lifestyles in stride. They're good at marketing (particularly the ones with Pluto in Libra), and even those who haven't paid their dues with long hours of diligent effort can go far.

# Hemispheres and Houses

Here we have a well-balanced personality: a perfectly equal number of planets above and below the horizon, and on the east and west sides of the chart. She knows who she is, but she's sensitive enough to others to be collaborative and popular; she has ability to assert herself in the public eye while staying grounded.

The chart's fourth and tenth houses are a bit larger than the others; building a strong sense of family and foundation, and proving herself in a meaningful career, are where she "lives," especially with several planets (including the Sun) in the tenth house. Whatever her line of work, she will definitely be noticed.

# Angular Planets

Two planets are close to the angles of the chart: the Sun, which is about 4 degrees from the Midheaven, and Neptune, a little over 7 degrees from the Descendant. We can assume she has charisma (the Sun) and an ethereal quality (Neptune), but these might also indicate she comes across as self-involved or flakey. The fact that these planets are in aspect to each other (in this case, a square aspect) indicates a dialogue between them—about how to build a strong sense of self (Sun) while remaining emotionally accessible and compassionate (Neptune)—that is one of the defining issues of her life.

Planets that conjunct the angles of the chart symbolize defining characteristics, and their aspects (especially to each other) represent fundamental themes for personal development.

# Elements and Modalities: Temperament and Mode

Her Highness was born with only one planet each in a fire sign (Neptune) and earth sign (Mars); she probably had a hard time learning how to handle the practical demands of life and remain grounded (earth), and a hard time retaining her vitality and coping with attention (fire). Only three planets are in fixed signs, with the rest fairly evenly distributed between cardinal and mutable signs. She likes to initiate things, has a lot of ideas, and is good at networking with others, but probably has a hard time sticking with schedules, routines, and repetitive tasks.

# Essential Dignities

The Princess was born with an enormous number of planets that are very strong by sign placement, either in the sign of their rulership or exaltation: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Uranus. Only Saturn, the planet of limits and authority, is in its detriment; she's had to work harder to develop personal boundaries and to accept leadership positions. However, the high number of planets that are strong by sign can suggest confidence, presence, and effectiveness.

# The Sun: Her Inner Heroine

The Sun is in the sign of Pisces and at the top of her birth chart, near the Midheaven (career point). This is an exceptionally strong placement for the Sun and makes the case that this is person who, above all, will stand out in a crowd and be noticed. However, Pisces is a sweet, sensitive sign and a person with the Sun here can find it exhausting to spend time in the public eye. Pursuits that allow her to indulge her imagination, connect with others emotionally, and help others awaken her inner heroine and makes her shine. If you ask Pisces Sun people what they'd like to do with their life, the answer is something like "help people" or "save the world," or perhaps something to do with dolphins.

The Sun is making several strong aspects to other planets. The square between the Sun and Neptune indicates a struggle (square) to gain a strong sense of self (Sun) despite her self-doubts and tenuous personal boundaries. Sometimes, this aspect describes the absence (Neptune) of a strong male role model (Sun); often, those with strong aspects between the Sun or Moon and Neptune use alcohol, drugs, or other substances to escape their problems. They might also lose themselves in art, music, films or TV, or dance. With the Sun trine Saturn, she might also lose herself in her work; this aspect suggests a strong work ethic, usually from a young age. With Saturn in the sign of its detriment, she may not have been good at saying no to work. And the Sun's trine aspect to Uranus in Scorpio in the fifth house gives our Princess an outrageous, even exhibitionist quality. She enjoys shocking people, and despite the ethereal qualities of Neptune and Pisces, she's a freedom-loving rebel.

# The Moon: The Inner Mom

The Moon in Cancer in a birth chart often describes someone whose mother was extremely prominent in the person's early life. Since the Moon is in the second house (security and possessions)
The Princess's mom may have been preoccupied with financial security and passed these concerns on to her daughter. The Moon is conjunct Saturn, which can describe a mother who also acted as a father or was a strict disciplinarian, or who was somewhat cold or needed more mothering herself than she was able to give. Those with this planetary aspect often describe themselves as having grown up lonely or alone, and being emotionally hungry. The Moon is opposed Mars, suggesting emotional volatility and projection. And the Moon's trine to Jupiter is a person who is generally loving, emphasizes an optimistic outlook, and encourages the Princess to think big.

# A popular misconception

A popular misconception is that Moon in Capricorn symbolizes a person who is cold, ruthless, or selfish. I think the truth is that those born with the Moon in Capricorn or the tenth house, or in close aspect to Saturn, often felt they had to take on far too much responsibility at a young age. It's rather like being a kitten who was left on the street in a cardboard box to fend for itself: it had to figure out the world on its own and provide for itself, and that's made it tough and self sufficient.

# The Ascendant: Her Armor

Gemini was rising on the Ascendant at her birth, which gives a mischievous, chameleon-like personality, often bubbly and chatty but also extremely perceptive and a careful listener. She's interested in everything and everybody; she's probably a voracious reader and has a huge network of friends and acquaintances. Mercury, the ruler of Gemini, is in Aquarius, so she will also exhibit some of the qualities of that sign in her personality—offbeat, rebellious, and surprising. Gemini on the Ascendant is the sign of someone who makes her way in the world with words; information and connections are her currency.

# The Tenth House: Career
So far, our chart interpretation has painted the portrait of a woman who is charismatic, sensitive, ambitious, emotionally hungry and volatile, who delights in shocking others and struggles with boundaries, clarity, and her own identity. Aquarius is on the Midheaven, indicating her career "style." She values freedom and originality above all other qualities in her work; Aquarius on the Midheaven is often self-employed and involved in technology, media, or professions that are considered unusual.

Uranus, the ruling planet of Aquarius, is in the fifth house, a house of creativity, self-expression, recreation, children, and performance. Along with the Sun very close to the Midheaven and in aspect to Uranus, she could be drawn to work in entertainment (especially music or film, ruled by Neptune, or television and computers, ruled by Uranus). She could also be closely aligned with humanitarian or political projects that help children. With Saturn, the career planet, in Cancer and close to the Moon, there may also be an interest in working on behalf of women's issues, homelessness, or hunger.

# The Fourth House: True North

Let's look at a few other points of interest in the chart. Twenty nine degrees of Leo is on the fourth house cusp. While I haven't covered fixed stars in this book (if you're interested in learning more, see Appendix C for resources), I do keep an eye out for some of the more prominent ones. Regulus, the Royal Star," is at 29° of Leo and is on the cusp of the Princess's fourth house. This degree on the Princess's fourth house suggest something of prominence about her pedigree. In fact, with the ruler of Leo, the Sun, conjunct the Midheaven of the chart, she might be well known (Sun conjunct the Midheaven) for her family heritage (the Sun is the ruler of Leo, the sign on the fourth house cusp).

# The Descendant: Relationships

With Sagittarius on the Descendant, the partnership house, our Princess is drawn to partners who are funny, smart, and opinionated; with Neptune close to the Descendant, they might also be religious, musical, heavy drinkers, or deceptive. Since there are no planets in the seventh house, we'll look at the ruler of the sign on the Descendant, Sagittarius, for clues about her partners. Sagittarius's ruling planet, Jupiter, is strong in Pisces, the sign of its traditional rulership, in the tenth house and very close to Venus. Her ideal partner would be extremely prominent (ruler of the Descendant in the tenth house), wealthy in his own right (Venus conjunct Jupiter), and musical, spiritual, empathetic, and sensitive (Pisces).

Venus conjunct Jupiter is a classic "lucky in love" aspect; however, it's worth noting that Venus (the relationship planet) is in a wide, out of sign opposition to Pluto. Venus opposing Pluto is a sort of "beauty and the beast" aspect, and she may be drawn to partners who are brooding, cynical, controlling, or manipulative. Along with the difficult aspects to her Sun and Moon, indicating that her parents and their marriage (the Sun and Moon symbolize Dad and Mom) might not have been an example of a happy, healthy marriage, the Princess has some issues to work out before she can enjoy the full measure of the very promising symbolism of Venus and Jupiter together. To the extent she is able to face and embrace the darker side of her own nature, she'll be less likely to confront it in dark, negative partners.

# How Did We Do?

Our mystery Princess is actress Drew Barrymore. Descended from the famed Barrymore acting family (called the "Royal Family of the Acting"), Barrymore made her first screen appearance in a television commercial at the age of 11 months. Her breakout film role in E.T., the Extraterrestrial made her a star at the age of 6. Precocious in talent, demeanor, and habits, she began drinking and taking drugs in early adolescence, attempting suicide and landing in rehab at age 14. She got sober and began remaking her career.

Her parents split up before she was born, and she grew up having very little contact with her father. She told People magazine that her first memory of him was at the age of 3, when he threw her against a wall in a drunken tantrum. (The Sun can indicate the father; it's from him that inherited her famous surname, but also the family curse: alcoholism.) Despite their estrangement, in 2003 Barrymore took over the organization and payment of her father's medical treatment until he died of cancer the following year.

Drew's mother Jaid was a struggling actress and dedicated partier who reputedly hit nightclubs with 8-year-old Drew in tow. Drew has described their relationship as "my greatest battle" (Moon conjunct Saturn, opposed Mars). At the age of 15 she petitioned a court for legal emancipation from her mother (Moon conjunct Saturn; Sun trine Uranus), and her films often explore difficult mother/daughter relationships. Promoting her film Whip It, Barrymore told the Daily Mail, "My own mom cared about Hollywood and I didn't. I wanted to act and I loved the creativity of it, but I didn't care for the lifestyle. A lot of the pain in the relationship between the mother and daughter came from my own experiences, and sections of their dialogue are verbatim conversations that took place between me and my mom. Everyone wants consistency in their family life, and that wasn't the case for me. It's why I'm so interested in telling stories about families."

In 1994, Barrymore married a bar owner (reflecting Drew's Sun square Neptune and Neptune conjunct the Descendant) named Jeremy Thomas; the marriage lasted two months. In 2001, she married comedian Tom Green, a gross-out, slapstick comic (Sagittarius on Drew's Descendant); the marriage lasted five months. She's also been in long-term relationships with rock drummer Fabrizio Moretti and comic actor Justin Long. With Uranus in the fifth house (romance), and fittingly for a member of the Uranus in Scorpio ("shocking sexuality") generation, she has described herself as bisexual and once, memorably, flashed her breasts while being interviewed by talk show host David Letterman.

Drew Barrymore has overcome a difficult childhood, substance abuse, and disappointing romantic relations to make a graceful transition from child star to full-fledged Hollywood mogul. As an actor, she remains a popular box-office draw 28 years after her first big hit, E.T. She recently directed her first film, and her production company is an impressive success, earning $250 million worldwide with her film remake of the '70s TV show Charlie's Angels. Barrymore is involved with a number of charities, notably World Food Program, which provides famine (Moon/Saturn) relief to Africa. Admired for her sunny disposition and career savvy, and for overcoming her early difficulties with grace and heart, Drew Barrymore has lived up to the promise of her Sun/Midheaven conjunction. Her personal motto might well be reflected in the tagline for her latest film: "Be your own hero."

# Essential Takeaways

* Astrology is a language, and like any language it has grammar that you need to learn in order to use it effectively.
* Planets are like nouns, describing people, places, and things and occupy space and perform actions.
* Signs of the zodiac are astrology's adjectives and adverbs, describing the planets and their activities.
* When learning to interpret astrology, begin by combining the key concepts of the planet, sign, house, and aspects to other planets.
* When preparing to read a chart, remember that symbols can be interpreted in more than one way; don't make assumptions.
* Use a systematic approach to analyzing key features of the chart and follow it step by step.
