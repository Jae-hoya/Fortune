## Asteroids and Other Non-planets

Chiron: healing and higher learning
Ceres, Vesta, Juno, and Pallas
The lunar nodes: past experience and future opportunity
The Part of Fortune and other Arabic parts
The vertex: relational turning points

When I began my formal astrology studies in the late 1980s, the use of asteroids in astrology was still pretty new. (My teacher, in fact, referred to them as "transiting gravel.") Demetra George had just published her pioneering book *Asteroid Goddesses* (see Appendix C), and some astrologers started to get pretty excited about these new symbols. Named for goddesses, the major asteroids seemed to offer feminine perspective that was sorely lacking in a modern astrology chock-full of manly symbolism.

Today, many astrologers swear by asteroids, using them (especially Chiron—ironically, the token male of the group) in a way very similar to planets in the chart. Asteroids can be interpreted in the birth chart or by transit according to their placement by sign, house, and in aspect to each other and to the planets and angles.

The asteroids commonly used in astrology are Chiron, which orbits between Saturn and Uranus, and the planetoids that orbit between Mars and Jupiter. Once classified as planets (in the early nineteenth century), they are Ceres (reclassified from asteroid to a dwarf planet in 2006), Vesta, Juno, and Pallas.

Asteroids are not included in most planetary ephemerides. However, most computer programs and online sites with calculation services (see Appendix C) include them upon request. Just ask for a chart that includes the asteroids and Chiron.

# Chiron, the Wounded Healer

The myth: Chiron is by far the most popular asteroid among astrologers. Those who use Chiron love Chiron, interpreting it in connection to healing (especially holistic healing) and higher knowledge.

Chiron was an outcast centaur (his family considered him a freak, what with the whole half-man, half-horse thing) who pulled himself up by his hoofstraps to become exceptionally learned and gentle. Chiron was a great healer, a really smart guy, and a mentor for unruly youth. Then he was accidentally wounded by his student, Hercules, with a poison arrow to his knee. Sadly, despite his knack for healing, Chiron was unable to cure himself–a bummer, because he was both immortal and in terrible pain. Eventually Chiron figured that since he was suffering anyway, he would give himself up to switch places with Prometheus, who was undergoing some painful trials of his own. So Chiron, along with his other great qualities, was pretty noble as well.

The moral of the story: Enduring emotional and physical pain can make you more sensitive to the suffering of others, and a more insightful healer.

How to interpret Chiron in the birth chart: In astrology, Chiron symbolizes traumas or wounds that are incurable but which can, through consciousness, be transformed into great strengths. Chiron is a symbol for healing and healers, holistic health, higher knowledge, and the mind/body connection. Joyce Mason, in her ebook *Chiron and Wholeness: A Primer* (www.joycemason.com), offers Michael J. Fox and his battle with Parkinson's disease; the late Christopher Reeve, who became a quadriplegic after a horse-riding accident; and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who's lost most of her family in tragic circumstances, as examples of Chiron's transformative principle at work.

## Ceres, the Great Mother

The myth: Ceres was the first asteroid discovered and is by far the largest. It's named for the Roman goddess of agriculture and the harvest. (The cereal you ate for breakfast this morning takes its name from Ceres.) It's Ceres's association with agriculture that leads astrologers to associate her with the qualities of nurturing, caretaking, parenting, and nourishing others.

Ceres also figures prominently in one of the great resurrection myths. Persephone is a maiden who is abducted and taken to live with Hades (whom we call by his Roman name, Pluto) in the underworld. This upsets her mother, Demeter (Ceres is the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess), so much that she goes to Hades to beg for her daughter's release. Eventually, Hades gives in—but then Hermes manages to trick Persephone into eating forbidden fruit, the seeds of the pomegranate, which will bind her forever to the underworld. In a cruel intimation of the future of custody arrangements, it's decided that Persephone will spend half the year below ground and the other half above ground—hence, the division between winter/autumn and summer/spring.

# The moral of the story

Whenever you love someone or something, you will eventually experience loss and grief—however fiercely you try to protect what you care about.

# How to interpret Ceres in the birth chart

Where in your life are you a nurturing caretaker? What do you love enough to fight for it as ferociously as a mother fights for her child? Ceres symbolizes the nurturing instinct. Its sign and house placement indicate your willingness to protect and defend people under your care, or even things, interests, or ideas that you care deeply about.

# Ceres Fast Facts

*   Key concepts—Nurturance, self-worth, attachment, loss, grief, sharing, productivity, self-reliance.
*   Symbolism—Goddess of agriculture, the Great Mother
*   Greek name: Demeter
*   Glyph—The sickle, symbol of agriculture
*   Orbit—1,680½ days (a little over 4½ years) to complete a tour of the zodiac
*   Possible rulerships—Cancer, Virgo, Taurus-Scorpio

In her classic *Asteroid Goddesses*, Demetra George suggests the following rulerships for Ceres:

*   Cancer: Nurturing, providing for others
*   Taurus-Scorpio polarity: Attachment and aversion, loss and rejection, capacity for grief, sharing
*   Virgo: Productivity, growth, self-reliance, work 

She offers Ceres as a symbol of parenting (especially mothers), pregnancy and childbirth, as well as physical, emotional, and spiritual nurturing. These qualities, combined with her connection to agriculture, make Ceres the consummate Earth Mother. If Ceres is negatively aspected in your birth chart, it may represent negative early parenting—the equivalent of being thrown into the waters of responsibility before you knew how to swim. You may have never know unconditional love, feel that you are unworthy of love, or believe you're not capable of independence and assertiveness.

# Vesta, Keeper of the Flame

**The myth:** Vesta is the Roman counterpart of the Greek Hestia, born to Cronus and Rhea. After a lively beginning in which she and her siblings were devoured by their father (who feared a prophecy that they would overthrow him), Hestia—having perhaps had her fill of domestic drama—chose to remain a virgin. She refused offers to marry Apollo or Poseidon (both up-and-coming gods with good prospects). She was worshiped as the goddess of hearth and home.

Vesta, the Roman corollary to Hestia, was honored in every Roman home with a sacred fire that was never allowed to go out. Vestal virgins kept Vesta's eternal flame alive in the temple devoted to her. The job of the virgins, who took the job at age 6 and vowed 30 years of service and chastity, was to purify the shrine and keep the sacred flame burning. In exchange, they were granted the unusual privileges of owning property, freeing criminals, being buried within city limits, and safeguarding wills and contracts.

**The moral of the story:** Devote all your energy and focus to your sacred task and you will serve a higher purpose and achieve respect and improved status.

How to interpret Vesta in the birth chart

Where in your life are you whole, complete, centered, and focused? Vesta symbolizes the ability to be alone, without comfort and companionship. Its sign and house placement indicate your willingness to make sacrifices in order to be of service in some area of your life.

# Juno, the Sacred Consort

**The myth:** Mythological Juno is the Roman counterpart to the Greek goddess Hera. Hera was Zeus's wife and main concubine and was known as the "Queen of Gods." Hera had a temper, and not one to the look the other way when Zeus messed around, she would often kill the other woman or the children she bore for Zeus. The moral of the story: Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

# How to interpret Juno in the birth chart

What do you need in order to feel happy in love, or that your marriage is a success? And if you don't get it, how jealous and angry are you apt to get?

# Pallas, the Warrior

The myth: The most popular of the myths involving Pallas has her springing fully formed, clad in full battle gear, from the head of her father, Zeus (a surprise, as he'd assumed he just had a nasty headache). Zeus quickly forgot the pain of Athena birth and favored her among all his children. Born from the head of a male, Pallas came to represent intellectual creativity and great wisdom, symbolizing a patriarchal schism between creative intellect and femininity (since she wasn't born through typical female reproduction). She was revered by Greeks as their protectress—a warrior goddess, but a warrior of the Libran variety, emphasizing justice and diplomacy rather than bloodshed. And it's a long story, but she's frankly a feminist nightmare, siding with patriarchy and against the civil and parental rights of women.

The moral of the story: Intellectual strength is superior to both reproductive power and brute force.

How to interpret Pallas in the birth chart

Are you smart, creative, and a late bloomer sexually? If you're a woman, how do you feel about having children? And if you're a man, do you get a lot of really bad headaches? (Kidding!) Are you a daddy's girl, a staunch defender of patriarchy? Do you fear success, especially worrying that it will preclude you from romantic satisfaction? Are you dedicated to influencing society to believe that women shouldn't be in positions of influence? You could well have been born with Pallas prominent in your birth chart.

## Pallas Fast Facts

* Key concepts—Intelligence, creativity, courage, fear, wisdom, the arts, politics, androgyny
* Symbolism—Goddess of wisdom and justice
* Latin name—Minerva
* Glyph—Spear
* Orbit—1,686.044 days (a little over 4½ years) to complete a tour of the zodiac
* Possible rulerships—Libra, Leo, Aquarius

# Cosmic Hula Hoops: Lunar Nodes

Like the angles of the chart, the lunar nodes aren't physical objects, but rather points where the Moon's orbital path intersects with the ecliptic (the Sun's apparent path). To get a mental picture of this, imagine a clutch of hula hoops swinging around you at various angles and occasionally knocking in to one another. The nodes are the points where they come together.

All planets have nodes, but the lunar nodes are the only ones commonly used in astrology and included in charts. The nodes are symbolized by symbols that look like horseshoes: the North Node is the horseshoe right-side up, the South Node is the horseshoe upside-down. Usually, only the North Node is included on a chart, but the South Node is always at exactly the same degree as the North Node in the opposite sign.

The North Node is sometimes referred to as the dragon's head, and the South Node as the dragon's tail. The dragon's head "eats" new experiences, and the dragon's tail is where past experiences are eliminated.

# The Meaning of the Nodes

The lunar nodes represent the polarity between past experience and future opportunity. The South Node represents your early environment and experiences (according to some astrologers, your past-life experiences), your unconscious mind, and your psychological safety zone. The North Node symbolizes your pathway to growth, people and situations that force you out of your comfort zone, and challenges that offer the promise of great reward.

# True vs. Mean Nodes

Unlike the planets, the lunar nodes move backward (retrograde) through the zodiac and clockwise through the houses of the birth chart. Their complete lap around the zodiac takes about 18½ years. But there's a catch: the Moon wobbles slightly, and its nodes don't move at exactly the same rate each day.

The mean node is calculated by taking the average rate of motion and averaging it out over 18½ years. This was the tried-and-true method before the joyful advent of computers, which are able to calculate the true node position without breaking a sweat.

The two placements are only a couple of degrees apart, so in most cases it doesn't really matter which you use. But if your nodes are close to the beginning or end of a sign, or if you're using particular predictive techniques involving the nodes, you're better off using the true node.

The Moon's mean node is calculated by averaging the node's average rate of motion over its 18½-year journey through the zodiac. The true node is the actual position of the node on a particular day. The two are usually only a degree or two apart, so it doesn't matter too much which you use—though why be mean when you can be true?

# Lunar Nodes by Sign and House

The sign placement of the nodes is generally shared by all people born within an approximate 18-month period, and refer to common evolutionary experiences. The house placement of the nodes refers to the areas of your life where this evolutionary struggle is experienced.

# Arabic Parts

The Arabic parts (or lots) don't represent physical points in the sky. Rather, they're mathematically derived from three points in the chart, such as planets or angles. The distance between two points is added to the position of the third to come up with the degree and sign of the part.

Arabic parts (or lots) originated in Arabia during the Middle Ages. Each part is derived from three points in a horoscope and represents a sensitive point in the chart that is connected to the three planets or other points from which is was derived. There are hundreds of Arabic parts, but today most astrologers use only the Part of Fortune, derived from the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant.

# The Part of Fortune

There are Arabic parts for a dazzling array of things, from marriage to pomegranates, but only one will commonly show up in your chart: The Part, or Lot, of Fortune. It represents the body, fortune, and health, as an indicator of material well-being. Since it's derived from the placements of the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant, it seems a sort of macrocosm of your ego, unconscious, and personality.

The formula for deriving the Part of Fortune differs depending on whether you were born during the day (the Sun is above the horizon in the chart) or at night (the Sun is below the horizon). Most computer programs take this into account, but if you're calculating it by hand, be sure you use the right formula:

* For day charts, the formula is: Ascendant + Moon - Sun
* For night charts, the formula is: Ascendant + Sun - Moon

The Part of Fortune is the one that regularly shows up in charts, and you'll probably never need to know how to calculate it. But if you want to, the instructions follow. The first two steps are the same for calculating any of the Arabic parts.

1. Translate each sign of the zodiac into degrees of the 360-degree horoscopic wheel.

Aries 0-29
Taurus 30-59
Gemini 60-89
Cancer 90-119
Leo 120-149
Virgo 150-179
Libra 180-209
Scorpio 210-239
Sagittarius 240-269
Capricorn 270-299
Aquarius 300-359

2. Translate each planetary placement in the formula into a degree.

Example (for a daytime birth, use Ascendant + Moon - Sun):

Sun 13° 25" Cancer
90 (first degree of Cancer)
+ 13.25 (degree of natal Sun)
103.25 (degree on horoscopic wheel)

Moon 24° 19" Libra
180 (first degree of Libra)
+ 24.19 (degree of natal Moon)
=204.19 (degree on horoscopic wheel)

Ascendant 5° 08" Virgo
150 (first degree of Virgo)
+ 5.08 (degree of natal Ascendant)
=155.08 (degree on horoscopic wheel)

3. Add the horoscopic degrees for the Ascendant and Moon together:
204.19
+ 155.08
=359.27 (Ascendant/Moon total)

4. Subtract the horoscopic degree of the Sun from the Ascendant/Moon total:
359.27
- 103.25
=256.02 (Ascendant/Moon - Sun total)

5. Convert the result to a horoscopic degree:

256.02 (falls between 240-269 Sagittarius)
-240.00 (first degree of Sagittarius)
16.02 (Part of Fortune: 16° 02" Sagittarius)

# Interpreting the Part of Fortune

The part of fortune is interpreted as a point in your chart that describes your worldly success. Planets or angles in close aspect to the Part of Fortune, the planet(s) ruling the sign of the Part of Fortune signify your calling and talents, as well as how easy or difficult it will be for you to make something of them. The sign and house placement of the Part of Fortune describes how, and in which areas of life, you're likely to find success.

# Other Cool Arabic Parts

Since you went to the trouble of learning the math, here are a few other fun Arabic parts that you can calculate and toss into your chart:

* The Part of Love: Ascendant + Venus - Sun
* The Part of Marriage (for a woman): Ascendant + Saturn - Venus
* The Part of Marriage (for a man): Ascendant + Venus - Saturn
* The Part of Sudden Happiness: Ascendant + Uranus - Jupiter

Notice that the formula for Part of Marriage for a woman adds Saturn (responsibilities) and subtracts Venus (pleasure), while the formula for a man is the reverse. (Hmmm...

# The Vertex
The vertex, like the lunar nodes, is another reference point in space rather than a physical object. The vertex marks the spot where the ecliptic (which, as you no doubt recall, is the hula hoop that marks the Sun's apparent annual journey across the sky, highlighted by the signs of the zodiac) meets the prime vertical. The prime vertical is a hula hoop that runs at right angles to the meridian and divides the celestial sphere from front to back (like a center part in your hair). The vertex can be interpreted according to its sign, house placement, and aspects to planets in your birth chart. It can be activated by transits, progressions, and the planets in another person's birth chart.

Except in rare instances at extreme latitudes, the vertex falls in the houses on the right (western, other-oriented) side of your chart, usually the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth house. Because of this orientation, it's thought that the vertex has something to do with fated relationships and pivotal meetings with people who catalyze growth. You may be the one catalyzed, but sometimes you may be the catalyst.

Vertex in the fifth house : Children, creative partners, lovers, givers of enjoyment, playmates who share hobbies or other recreational interests.

Vertex in the sixth house : Co-workers, healers, servants, and those who share a bond of service.

Vertex in the seventh house : Equal partners, spouses, open enemies, adversaries in lawsuits, rivals.

Vertex in your eighth house : Intimate partners, people in a power-based relationship, those who share a joint bank account or property, insurers, inheritance, psychotherapy.

# The Antivertex

The point exactly opposite the vertex is called the antivertex. It falls on the left (eastern, or self-oriented) side of your chart, usually in the twelfth, eleventh, first, or second house. You'll almost never find it marked in the chart, but it's the same degree as the vertex and in the opposite sign and house. Here, there are situations and people who reinforce the personal status quo, allowing or even encouraging each other to remain pretty much as they are. This is not always negative, and may be done with kind intentions, but the net result is a nagging feeling that you're not growing.

**Antivertex in the eleventh house:** Peers who encourage conformance to a group. More positively, friends and associates who are accepting of each other based on having many things in common.

**Antivertex in the twelfth house:** Your priest, your hidden enemies, your psychic, or your drug dealer. These people are invested in your blind side, where you can't see the whole picture and must rely on intuition or faith.

**Antivertex in the first house:** People who respond to your looks, personality, drive, and assertiveness. These are people who encourage you to look out for number one.

**Antivertex in the second house:** Those with whom you exchange money, gifts, or other forms of security. These may be customers or admirers, or you may be their customer or admirer.

Like the Ascendant and Midheaven, the vertex is an extremely time-sensitive point. If you don't have your exact birth time, don't bother with the vertex. Honestly, most people don't—not even those who know their exact birth time.

# The Vertex in Your Chart

Hardly anyone uses the vertex or writes about the vertex, but it's commonly assumed to have some relevance in how you relate to other people or to events. Some astrologers assert that it's connected to turning points, ah-ha moments, and fateful encounters with others. The vertex can be activated by transits, progressions, or directions (see Part 6); by the planets in another person’s chart; or if you move to a new place. The house and sign position can offer clues as to where the change or turning point may take place and in what way.
