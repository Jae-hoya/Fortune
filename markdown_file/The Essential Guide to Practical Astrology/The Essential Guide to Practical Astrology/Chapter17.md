## Cycles Made Simple

The cycles of the planets define the landscape of your life. Some planets move very slowly. Their cycles are like towering granite monuments, marking major milestones: graduations, marriages, births, deaths, career achievements. They're few, but they can be seen for miles around. Other planets move a little more quickly. Their cycles are like tall, well-lit, eye-catching billboards commemorating the year's top events—a job promotion, a new house, an overseas vacation. This is the stuff of holiday newsletters and conversation around the Thanksgiving table. Other planets whip through a sign of the zodiac in a single month. Their cycles are like colorful fliers slapped on telephone posts, advertising your company's monthly sale, a lost or found pet, a class that you're teaching.

Handwritten and cheery, propped up on a curb outside your favorite restaurant, a chalkboard lists the day's specials. What sounds good, fun, appealing, and tasty today? Of the many projects on your to-do list, which is the one that will get your attention today? Look to the Moon, which covers the entire zodiac in a month.

How to work with planetary cycles

Remember the movie Groundhog Day? Bill Murray plays a misanthropic TV weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day again and again. He moves through the stages of denial, anger, and depression, and abuses his immortality by engaging in bizarre pranks, and every morning he wakes up to do it all again.

Eventually it dawns on him that he can use the time a little more wisely, and embarks on a project to improve himself, learn new things, and use every bit of skill and ingenuity to live that same day better and better.

Life is cyclical. We don't live exactly the same day again and again, but sometimes it feels as though we are. It's lunchtime again, and our birthday again, and Christmas time again, and it feels like we've done it all before.

Astrology's greatest gift, to me, is that it provides a framework for understanding the cycles of your days, your seasons, and your lifetime—to recognize more quickly where you are on the circle of your life, identify when it's time to tackle a particular lesson, and to make conscious decisions that increase your enjoyment of, and contribution to, your world.

## The Circle of the Month

Each month, the Moon makes a full circle around the zodiac. Its cycle is a lovely microcosm of the annual rhythm of the seasons; its phases are, in fact, like miniseasons. Each New Moon offers the springtime energy of new beginnings and fresh starts. The First Quarter Moon is like summer, a time to actively tend your crops and enjoy watching them grow. Full Moon is like autumn, the month's harvest time, when you get a full picture of how things are progressing. And Last Quarter Moon is like wintertime, time to review your results, discuss them with others, and make resolutions for the next cycle.

In Chapter 18, you'll learn more about the Moon's journey through the zodiac, and in Chapter 19 you'll learn how to use its monthly phases to make better use of your time and energy.

# Seasonal Turning Points

As we've seen in previous chapters, the four cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) and the four angular houses of the horoscope (first, fourth, seventh, tenth) symbolize the turning wheel of your life and signal major change and events. Four times each year, the Sun enters one of the cardinal signs, marking the transition to a new season. Because the Sun's tour of the zodiac is not exactly the same length as a calendar year, the date of these seasonal changes can vary from year to year by one day, but they're roughly as follows:

March 20/21 Sun enters Aries: Spring/Vernal equinox
June 20/21 Sun enters Cancer: Summer/Summer solstice
September 22/23 Sun enters Libra: Autumn/Autumnal equinox
December 21/22 Sun enters Capricorn: Winter/Winter solstice

Note that this information refers to the seasons of the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the dates and months of the equinoxes and solstices are the same, but the seasons are reversed. So down under, the vernal equinox takes place in September and the autumnal equinox in March; the summer solstice is in December, and the winter solstice is in June.

These seasonal turning points are of particular interest to mundane astrologers, the intrepid souls who use astrology to study world affairs. Mundane astrologers cast charts for the moment the Sun enters one of these cardinal signs in various world capitals, and then they use the charts to anticipate the mood and major events of the coming three-month period. These charts are called ingress charts, because they're cast for the moment of the Sun's ingress, or entry, into a sign of the zodiac.

# All Things Being Equal: Equinoxes

The word equinox comes from the Latin aequus (equal) and nox (night); it refers to the phenomenon of day and night being at about equal length on the day of the equinox. Equinoxes occur twice each year and mark the beginning of spring (March 20 or 21) and autumn (September 22 or 23). Between the spring and autumn equinoxes, the Sun spends more time above the horizon than below it in a 24-hour period, reaching the maximum hours of daylight at the summer solstice; between autumn and spring equinoxes, the reverse is true, reaching minimum hours of daylight at the winter solstice.

The vernal or spring equinox corresponds to the Sun's ingress into the sign of Aries and the beginning of a new seasonal year. The autumnal equinox mark's the Sun's ingress into the sign of Libra. The balance of night and day echoes the archetypal symbolism of the Aries/Libra polarity: the need to balance individual (Aries) concerns with the needs and concerns of others (Libra). The dance of relationship requires honoring both sides of the equation; obviously you can't have a good relationship without taking the needs of both partners into consideration, but you also can't have a good relationship unless you have a good understanding of who you are and what you need from life.

# When Time Stands Still: Solstices
# The word solstice

The word solstice comes from the Latin *sol* (sun) and *-stitium* (stoppage). Over the course of the year, the Sun's elevation (relative to the horizon) at noon rises, reaching its peak at the summer solstice; then seems to stop and change direction, with the Sun reaching a lower elevation at noon each day until at the winter solstice it reaches its lowest point.

The summer solstice refers to the longest day of the year, when the Sun reaches its maximum elevation at noon. The winter solstice refers to the shortest day, when the Sun reaches its minimum elevation at noon.

The summer solstice marks the Sun's ingress into the sign of Cancer; at the winter solstice, the Sun moves into Capricorn. The Sun's highest and lowest points at the solstices reflect the symbolism of the Cancer/Capricorn polarity, which contrasts inner/emotional and familiar connections (Cancer) with worldly ambitions and reputation. The chilly characteristics of Capricorn are embodied in archetypal Christmas/winter solstice figures such as Dickens's Mr. Scrooge and Mr. Potter of *It's a Wonderful Life*. The warm, nurturing, family-oriented Cancer imagery finds its way into summer's backyard barbecues and beach holidays.

# The spring and autumn equinoxes

The spring and autumn equinoxes mark the equal length of day and night. Between spring and fall, the Sun spends more hours above the horizon; between fall and spring, it is below the horizon for more time each day. The summer and winter solstices mark the longest (summer) and shortest (winter) days of the year. Between the winter and summer solstices, the Sun gradually rises in elevation at noon, and between summer and winter it gradually lowers.

# Planetary Cycles and the Seasons of Your Life

The Sun, Moon, and planets move through the sky at different speeds relative to our earthly perspective. Some move quickly, changing signs every month, or even every couple of days; others glide along at a somewhat more sedate pace, taking a couple of months or a couple of years to finish their celestial journey; still others lumber at a glacial rate, taking an entire generation to get through a single sign of the zodiac.

The planetary positions at the moment of your birth are static—for you. But the planets didn't stop in their orbits when you were born; they continued moving, and have been running their relay races ever since. Understanding the full picture of astrology means understanding the rudiments of these cycles, and interpreting what it means when the relationships between the planets gradually changes.

## Cycles of Inner Planets

The inner planets, sometimes called the "personal planets," are Mercury and Venus. Like a sprinter running in the innermost track, inner planets move through the zodiac quickly, in one year or less. Astrologers refer to the Sun and Moon as planets for the sake of convenience, and because the Sun moves through the zodiac in about a year and the Moon covers the same ground in only 28 days, they are included in this group. For more information about planning your daily and monthly affairs with the cycles of the inner planets, including descriptions of their trip through particular signs of the zodiac and houses of your chart, see Chapters 18 and 19.

## Sun

The Sun takes one year to make a full trip around the zodiac (from our perspective; in reality, of course, we're the ones taking the trip, around the Sun) and will pass through every house of your birth chart in one year as well. The Sun takes about one month to move through a sign of the zodiac. Its entry into the cardinal signs marks the beginning point of each season (in the Northern Hemisphere, Aries for spring, Cancer for summer, Libra for autumn, Capricorn for winter). The Sun's cycle is descriptive of vitality, procreation, liveliness, creativity, and warmth. See Chapter 19 for more about the Sun's annual journey through the signs of the zodiac and the houses of your chart.

## Moon

The earth's Moon takes about 28 days to make a full cycle through the zodiac, changing signs about every 2½ days. The Moon's cycle is descriptive of emotional fluctuations, sensitivity, the public and its moods, and domestic and agricultural activities. Its eight major phases, symbolizing its relationship to the Sun, delineate an important monthly cycle of beginnings, adjustments, reevaluations, and endings. See Chapter 18 for more about the Moon's monthly journey through the signs of the zodiac, and Chapter 19 for more about the Moon's monthly phases.

# Mercury
Mercury takes 88 days to make a full circle around the zodiac. It never orbits farther than 29 degrees from the Sun, and it turns retrograde several times each year for about three weeks at a time. Mercury cycles indicate optimal times for learning, communicating, and documenting information.

# Venus
Venus takes 245 days to make a full circle around the zodiac. It never orbits farther than 45 degrees from the Sun, and it turns retrograde every year and a half for about for full cycle. Cycles of Venus represent the ebb and flow of personal relationships and financial matters.

# Definition
Retrograde is the term used for when a planet appears to move backward in its orbit.

# Cycles of Societal Planets
The societal planets—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn— orbit between the earth and Saturn. The societal planets aren't as speedy, or their focus as subjective, as the inner planets; they symbolize the process of socialization, of learning to work within societal structures. Their trips around the zodiac ranges from 2½ years to 29 years, and symbolize important milestones of a 1- to 2-year period. For more information about using the cycles of these planets to help plan your year ahead, see Chapter 20.

# Mars
Mars takes about 2½ years to take a full turn around the Sun. It turns retrograde once every two years, for anywhere from 58 to 81 days. Mars cycles represent assertiveness, beginnings, individual pursuits, and sexuality.

# Jupiter
Jupiter takes about 12 years to orbit the Sun, changing signs once every 12 months. It's retrograde for about half of every year. Jupiter's cycles represent higher knowledge and education, long-distance travel, adventure, and the development of your belief system.

# Saturn
Saturn -The full cycle of Saturn is 29½ years. It spends about 2½ years in each sign of the zodiac, and is retrograde for about half of every year. Saturn's cycles are related to career, ambition, parenthood, leadership, and worldly pursuits.

# Cycles of Generational Planets
The generational planets—Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto—are the planetary runners in the outermost tracks, and they take so long to orbit the Sun that they affect entire generations of people in similar ways. Their journeys through the zodiac range from 84 to 245 years, and symbolize important cycles of often life-changing importance. For more information about anticipating major milestones using the cycles of the generational planets, see Chapter 21.

# Uranus
Uranus makes a full cycle of the zodiac in 84 years. It's retrograde for about half of each year, and it changes signs once every seven years. Cycles of Uranus are related to individuality, rebellion, change, chaos, and revolution.

# Neptune
Neptune takes 165 years to make a full circle around the zodiac. It's retrograde for half of each year; it changes signs only once every 12 years or so. Cycles of Neptune are associated with spirituality, enlightenment, clarity, and togetherness.

# Pluto

Pluto takes 245 years to make a full circle around the zodiac and is retrograde for half of each year. Because of its erratic orbit, it spends much more time in certain signs than others; in recent history, it's spent as few as 12 years and as many as 33 years in a single sign. Cycles of Pluto are associated with power, control, strength, and destruction.

Certain important planetary cycles converge in everybody's charts when we reach particular ages. There's some comfort in knowing that little Johnny's terrible twos, your teenager's rebellious phase, or your husband's midlife crisis are all part of a predictable planetary schedule!

# Planetary Traffic Jams

Ever have one of those years? One that's like a country song, when your lover leaves, your dog runs away, and someone spills beer on your new boots? Sure, we all have years like that. And there are certain ages when we all have one of those years. They're the terrible twos, the first years of high school, turning 21, looking down the barrel of 30, hitting the midlife crisis, and preparing for retirement. That's because the slower-moving planets have cycles that converge, pretty reliably, at particular times of life.

# The Terrible Twos

What happens when a kid hits the terrible twos? Astrologically speaking, two things: Junior gets his first Mars return at about age 2½, when Mars returns to the same degree of the same sign it was in at his birth. This is when a kid will typically discover his inner No, which is usually charmingly accompanied by the classic kicking, screaming temper tantrum. You gotta love a human being of any age who is completely in the thrall of hot-tempered, self-centered, me-centric Mars! Or not.

Secondly, Jupiter makes a square aspect to its position in Junior's birth chart. He's ready to be a big boy. He's thinkin' big. He's outgrowin' all his clothes. He wants a trike. Together with the willfulness of Mars, this makes for a handful cocktail. He settles down a bit between 3 and 5, but then he hits school and Saturn makes its first difficult aspect to Saturn in his birth chart and he gets his first taste of society’s rules.


# High School Horror

Around the age of 14, Junior hits high school. He has a Jupiter square to natal Jupiter, and Saturn reaches the opposition point to his natal Saturn. Suddenly, his parents and counselors are urging him to figure out what to do in the present to make his dreams come true in the future. It's a lot of pressure. Back in my day, every kid got his or her driver's permit at age 15 and applied for a license on his or her sixteenth birthday; that's just how one spent one's sweet 16. It was all about authority, and Saturn kicking us to step to the plate and claim a taste of adulthood.

Meanwhile, we were sassing our parents and teachers and refusing to do what anyone told us; such is the nature of a Saturn opposition.

# Legal Adulthood

In the United States you're legally an adult—meaning you can enter into legal agreements and vote—at the age of 18, but you can't legally drink until the age of 21. This happens to coincide with one of the most volatile periods a young person has yet faced: squares from Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus to their positions in the birth chart, all within a 3- to 4-year period. If your parents don't kick you out of the house, you're eager to kick yourself out by this time. You have places to go and things to do, you want to really prove you're a grown-up, and you absolutely can no longer abide being told what to do by your parents. So you go away to college or get a job and move into your own place.

# First Chance for Failure: 27-30

Between the ages of 27 and 30, you'll have a Saturn return: Saturn will return to the position it was in at your birth. There are some other Jupiter aspects during this period that intensify the experience, but essentially this is all about Saturn, the planet of worldly ambition and success, and whether or not you've achieved any or are at least on track to do so. If you're not remotely living up to your potential, you will, for the first time, get a real taste of what it would be like to be a failure. Objectively, you’re still too young for the verdict to be in. There’s plenty of time to turn the ship around and sail for more promising waters. But you may very well feel old, and for the very first time, mortal. It’s not a great feeling.
 
I had just begun my formal astrology studies around this age, and fortunately I could see what I needed to do. Bored and with no chance for advancement at my well-paid but dull office job, I jumped ship three days before my thirtieth birthday to make my living as an astrologer. I celebrated my thirtieth birthday feeling pretty satisfied with the way my life was going, and never regretted my decision .


# Last Chance for Success? 35-42

When people talk about the midlife crisis, they're talking about the period between the ages of about 35 and 42, when all astrological heck breaks loose. Sometime within this period, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto all make difficult aspects to their positions in your birth chart. This is a time when we come to terms with the career decisions we made at 30, with the consequences of the lives we've built for ourselves, the ideals that may or may not be panning out, and usually, some real and grim reminders that nothing lasts forever as the elder generation begins to die out.

# Passing the Torch: 55-60

Ideally, this is the time in your lie when you survey the landscape of your lifetime of achievement with a glad eye. You begin the process of mentoring the next generation of movers and shakers in your field. You teach, or write your memoirs. Increasingly, you feel restless in your current role, looking ahead to a rich and spontaneous retirement from public life. But this rosy scenario is dependent on your having done a lot of hard work and made a series of good decisions over the past 29½ years since your first Saturn return. Have you achieved all you wanted to achieve? Have you collected memories worth preserving in a book? If not, the second Saturn return can be a hard time when you feel as though you've missed your chance for success.

As you ease into your 60s, traditionally a time for retirement, your hope lies in no longer caring about worldly achievement. Uranus's last square to its position in your birth chart, much like its first square at age 21, emphasizes individuality and freedom. Even if you haven't achieved all you might have, there's still time to shake things up—to wake up the world, and to awaken to your own originality. But it means throwing off the shackles of the security you've accumulated in the course of your career, and that can be scary.

# Retrogrades

Two guys walking into a bar backward would get your attention. There may be a very good reason for it, but the fact remains that it's behavior that defies expectation.

The same is true when planets are retrograde. (Apparent) retrograde motion is when a planet appears, from our earthly perspective, to be moving backwards—opposite its normal trajectory through the sky, and opposite the other planets. "Retrograde" is from the Latin *retrogradus*, or backward step. Basically, the retrograde motion of planets is an optical illusion created by the difference in speed between other planets and earth.

When Mercury is retrograde, we often wind up retracing our steps and redoing things repeatedly until we get them right. My astrology teacher used to say that when Mercury is retrograde, you should try as much as possible to do things you enjoy—because you'll end up doing them over and over!

# Retrograde Planets

Every planet (other than the Sun and Moon) has retrograde periods. In fact, the slower-moving planets are retrograde for half of each year. Each planet's retrograde cycle symbolizes appropriate times to move forward on matters associated with the planet (when the planet is direct) and times to hold back and rethink things (retrograde).

* Mercury is retrograde about three times each year, for three weeks at a time. Mercury is the planet that rules, among other things, communication, technology, transportation, and learning. Its retrograde periods are times when anything and everything related to these areas of life are presumed to be vulnerable to misadventure or unpredictability. Not the best time to buy new mechanical gizmos, especially cars, computers, or phones; sign contracts or make agreements; or begin new courses of study. (See Appendix B for a table of Mercury retrograde periods through 2020.)
* Venus is retrograde approximately 40 to 43 days every 18 months. It's considered an unfortunate time to marry or move in with a partner, form other legal partnerships, make major purchases, hold formal social affairs, (a charity ball, for instance), have cosmetic surgery, or initiate a landscaping project for your home. It can be a good time for recovering money that's owed to you, formulating a financial plan, redecorating, or reuniting with friends or loved ones from your past.
* Mars is retrograde approximately 58 to 81 days every two years. It's a time to reconsider the ways in which you assert and defend yourself, express anger, deal with conflict, approach your work, and handle sexuality. It's considered a difficult time to start a new job or business, enter a competition, or initiate warfare; it might not be the best time for elective surgery. It may be a good time, however, to return to a former job, type of work, or sport; investigate new skills to help you cope with anger and conflict; and catch up on your rest.

The outer planets, Jupiter through Pluto, are retrograde for half of each year. Their retrograde times are probably not enough to cause problems unless they are also making difficult aspects to planets in your birth chart while they're retrograde:

* Jupiter's retrograde periods are a good time to resume your education, take a long-delayed trip, reread favorite books; they're less than optimal times to gamble, open a play, or launch a career as a teacher. Businesses that begin during these periods may not prosper financially because the owner is too generous with employees or customers, expands too quickly, or bites off more than he or she can comfortably chew.

* When Saturn is retrograde, it's all too easy to let your personal boundaries weaken and to agree to things you know you should (and normally, would) refuse. Therefore, these aren't great times to make new commitments, but they're good times to revisit commitments you've already made and make sure they're still appropriate for you. Starting a business is not so bad, but incorporating one might not be a good idea now. Consider and reinforce the structures of your life, including problems with your home, organizational problems with your business, or discipline problems with your children.

* Uranus's retrograde periods are good times to ask questions, shake up routines, connect with old friends, and for an incumbent to be re-elected. Energy tends to build during these times, and rebellion can come spilling out when Uranus turns direct.

* Neptune's retrograde times are good for spiritual retreat and reflection, to return to spiritual places that mean a lot to you, and for psychic and intuitive work. It's easier to see things clearly when Neptune is retrograde, if we're willing to accept the reality we see instead of trying to deny it.

* Pluto retrograde is excellent for psychological and physical healing and cleansing. It's a time when self-control is easier to harness, and it can be an excellent time for breaking habits of addiction and addressing psychological problems such as phobias, fears, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Trying to control others doesn't generally work well now, and in fact will backfire; but controlling and empowering yourself is good work for Pluto's retrograde periods.

## When Good Planets Turn Retrograde

When a planet is retrograde, the things associated with the planet behave unpredictably. It's as though the god for which the planet was named, who's usually looking over things to make sure they're functioning properly, has gone on coffee break and left us to our own devices. Things symbolized by the planet may be lost, or if lost before may now return. We don't see matters related to the planet very clearly.

If a planet was retrograde at the time of your birth (and since the slower-moving planets are retrograde for half of each year, it's a good bet that at least one planet was retrograde), the glyph and degree/minute of the planet will be accompanied by this symbol: R.

Some astrologers feel retrograde planets at your birth represent areas that require extra effort on your part to become proficient. Some feel that retrograde planets represent heightened awareness or ability. My own experience is that retrograde planets in the birth chart seem to describe areas of life in which you naturally operate differently from other people. For instance, if you were born with Mercury retrograde, you may have a different style of learning or grasping information than other people. If you were born with Jupiter retrograde, you may have a belief system that's very different from those of the people who grew up around. I think retrograde planets also point to abilities or gifts you were born with, that can't always be explained rationally. People born with Mercury retrograde, for instance, are often exceptionally perceptive and insightful, noticing things others overlook.

# Making Retrogrades Work for You

Because a planet doesn't seem to function as expected while retrograde, astrologers tend to issue dire warnings about not getting your computer repaired while Mercury is retrograde and not buying a house while Venus is retrograde. There's something to these warnings, but proclamations like that always make me feel rebellious, and at the very least it's fair to ask "Why?" After all, it's not practical to spend nine Mercury retrograde weeks out of every year in communication/technology lockdown mode. In fact, what I've often found is that Mercury (mischief maker that he is) often likes to push the issue; that just before Mercury turns retrograde, the car breaks down, your computer gives you the blue screen of death, or you accidentally drop your cell phone in the aquarium. Well, what are you gonna do? If you live 20 miles from your job and public transportation isn't an option, you make your living as a website designer, or you don't have a land line—obviously, you've got to play ball with Mercury.

So what does it mean when Mercury, or indeed any planet, is retrograde?
It means that you may not have all the facts you need to make an informed decision about matters related to that planet. It's the reason astrologers urge clients not to make big, not easily reversible decisions like getting married or buying a home when Venus (planet of property and marriage) is retrograde, or to perhaps rent a car instead of buying one when Mercury is retrograde, or to resist following their guru to India when Neptune is retrograde.

# Retrogrades

Retrogrades are not, generally, the right time to begin things; rather, they're times for finishing up unresolved matters. The popular thinking is that anything that begins with "re-" is appropriate to do during a retrograde period—rethink, reissue, refinish, refresh, and, most of all, reflect.

# The Shadow Period

So up until the minute the planet turns retrograde, and the minute after it turns direct, you're in the clear—right? Sorry. You also need to know about a little something called "the shadow period," which begins before the planet turns retrograde and extends after it turns direct again. These are periods when the planet is functioning in a sort of retrograde fashion even though it is, technically, moving forward.

It works like this. On April 17, 2010, Mercury turns retrograde at 13 degrees of Taurus, which for the sake of narrative interest we'll call "Disneyland." Mercury continues on its backward trajectory until May 11, 2010, when it turns direct again at 3 degrees of Taurus—let's call it "Dodger Stadium." But of course, this is not the first time in recent history that Mercury had visited Dodger Stadium; in fact, he had caught a game there on April 3, 2010, on his way to Disneyland. Now, it's well known that Mercury has a bit of a short attention span, to the extent that I rather suspect he keeps forgetting about the whole retrograde business entirely. And on April 3, when the Dodgers waved up at Mercury and told him, "See you again in a couple of weeks!", Mercury had gone on his blithe and merry way, not quite sure what to make of that comment, so distracted by it that he started losing people's mail and scrambling their phone calls and crashing their hard drives. He was still moving forward, but his mind was back at Chavez Ravine with those inscrutable, irreverent Dodgers. So on April 17 Mercury gets to the ticket booth at Disneyland when he realizes that somewhere along the way, he's lost his wallet. He turns retrograde, to retrace his steps and find it. He's now in full-on backtracking/misplacing things/forgetting stuff mode, stumbling along until eventually, on May 11, he finds himself right back at Dodger Stadium, where the entire team snickers and veteran sportscaster Vin Sculley holds up Mercury's wallet. Mercury slaps his forehead; says, "Oh yeah. Retrograde!"; turns direct again; and starts the same tedious trip down Interstate 5 toward Disneyland, for the third time. But he's still a little rattled, plus he keeps finding lost mail along the way, discovers his lost car keys, and meets up with old friends. At last, on May 27, Mercury again reaches Disneyland, where he finally buys a ticket and gets to ride the Matterhorn bobsleds.

# Working with Planetary Cycles

In Chapters 18 through 21, we'll take a look at planetary cycles moving through your birth chart. In order to get the most out of those chapters, you'll need to know how to find the current position of the planets, and how to apply that information to your birth chart. Here's how it's done:

* Get the current planetary positions. Chapter 2 gives various alternatives for getting your hands on your birth chart, which is essentially a record of the planetary positions on the day you were born. Use the same options to find the planetary placements for today's date, or for any other date. You can find these planetary positions in an online ephemeris, an astrological calendar, or simply by calculating a chart for today's date (in your location), using an online service or computer program.

* Use the information with your birth chart. Start with the position of a planet—say, Venus. As of October 20, 2010, Venus is at 10 degrees and 13 minutes of the sign Scorpio. So it's currently moving through the sign of Scorpio. Which house of your birth chart is it moving through? In your chart, find the house cusp with Scorpio on it.

In the following chart, the sixth house has 18.49 (that's 18 degrees and 49 minutes) of Scorpio on the cusp. That means anything after 18.49 Scorpio comes after this house cusp, and anything before falls in a preceding house. The previous house, the fifth, has 10.27 Libra on the cusp. Anything that falls between 10.27 Libra and 18.48 Scorpio is moving through the fifth house. And since Venus is currently at 10.13 Scorpio, the fifth house is where we'll currently find her.

# Essential Takeaways

* Equinoxes and solstices mark the changing of the seasons and correlate to the cardinal signs and angular houses.
* Planetary cycles have varying lengths and mark the changing of your life's seasons.
* Certain ages of your life are characterized by particular planetary cycles that are common to everyone at about the same ages.
* Planets (not the Sun or Moon) periodically turn retrograde, or appear to move backwards in their orbits. These are times when the planet seems to work differently or unpredictably than its usual symbolism would suggest.

* To work with current planetary cycles, find the current planetary positions and superimpose them on your birth chart to find which house of your chart is being affected.
