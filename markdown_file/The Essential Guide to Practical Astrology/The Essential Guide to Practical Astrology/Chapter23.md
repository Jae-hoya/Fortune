## Prediction

## Practical and ethical considerations for reading someone's chart

## Understanding and using transits

## Using progressions

I suspect prediction works best when the person you're reading for is... predictable—that is, when the person is susceptible to societal pressures and messages and sees him- or herself as subject to the whims of fate. Even then, the birth chart is like any map: it can show us the roads that are available, but not which road we'll choose to take, or how we'll react to what we meet along the way. In short, maps—including birth charts—can tell us how to get where we're going, but not where we'll end up!

People have free will. They make choices about how to react to all the factors that influence them. That's why we hear stories of heroism and of people rising from rags to riches or overcoming terrible deprivation and hardship. Always make room in your interpretations for free will, and for the idea that a person has overcome the "lower" impulses of the symbolism in the chart.

## Practical and Ethical Considerations

Be cautious about reading charts for friends and family. It's tempting to do this when you're first learning astrology; after all, who else is going to sit still and let you practice on them? The problem is that when you read a chart for someone, the power dynamic between you can subtly shift. You're the one with the answers. You've seen their eighth house, for heaven's sake! You're like the guy at the airport who gets to read the whole-body scanner and knows what the hot trends are in underwear.

Plus, once you get good at it, you're not going to get a moment's peace at parties, brunch, weddings, or funerals. That's when you know you've entered the Astrologer Zone and it's time to tighten up your boundaries. Professional, highly paid dentists and accountants don't spend all their time at parties gazing at errant molars and answering questions about amortization (an accounting thing, yes?). Follow their example, at least to the point of administering nitrous oxide and dropping a dime on tax evaders.

!Astro Alert

Astrology illuminates the dark corners of the psyche as well as indicating talent and potential. Before you begin reading charts for people, ask yourself how comfortable you'll be exploring touchy subjects and occasionally delivering bad news. The astrologer must use positive language and offer solutions and hope, but a reading that completely avoids tough subjects is usually not much help.

If you're interested in reading charts for total strangers for money, keep in mind that like all professions, astrology has professional organizations. In addition to hosting the usual conference schmoozefests and publishing glossy quarterly journals, astrology organizations certify astrologers and promote astrology to the public at large. Partly for this reason, they require their members to endorse a code of ethics for professional astrologers. Among other things, they usually require that their members

* Don't claim to be infallible.
* Offer an interpretation that allows for a variety of possible meanings and outcomes.
* Don't date their clients.
* Don't perform clandestine reconnaissance missions (e.g., reading a third party's chart without that person's permission).
* Don't scare the wits out of their clients.

That last one is important: an ethical astrologer is a tactful astrologer who doesn’t use predictions in a way that leaves a client paralyzed with fear. Accomplishing this isn’t so hard; basically, be careful how you word the possible negative outcomes, and be sure to balance them out with possible positive outcomes. Doing this doesn’t mean you’re a weenie who’s afraid of telling the truth; it means you’re humble enough to realize you don’t necessarily know everything. 

# Popular Tools for Prediction

There are many, many tools an astrologer might whip out of the toolbox for the purpose of prediction. Some are based on the birth chart, others aren't. Horary astrology, for instance, is based on the time someone asks a question. It's best used for important questions like "Will I get the job?", and it's helpful for simple yes or no questions. It can even help you find your lost keys. It's a specialty, though, and not all astrologers know how to do it. Then there are those (like me) who know how but just don't have the knack. So find a specialist.

Most astrologers, though, have mastered the predictive techniques discussed in the following sections.

# The Current Sky: Transits

Take the positions of the planets in sky at any given moment—say, right now. Astrologers call those "transiting planets." Observe their celestial soap opera of harmony and seething hatred, jealousy and adventure; their interactions with one another symbolize what the whole world is going through at that moment. (Remember the astrologer's motto: "As above, so below." If it's happening up there, it's happening down here.) Then, take those same planetary positions and drop them into your birth chart; that tells us how the world is treating you. What are the mighty forces (evil twin? husband back from the dead and now played by a different actor?) affecting the course of your life and urging you to react?

# Transits to Transits
As they move through the sky at different speeds, the transiting planets change their positions relative to the zodiac, the earth, and to other transiting planets. Of particular interest are moments when

* Transiting planets move into a new sign of the zodiac, particularly slower-moving planets which change signs infrequently.
* Transiting planets change direction (see Chapter 17), turning either retrograde or direct.
* Transiting planets form exact aspects (see Chapter 16) to one another. This is particularly thrilling when slow-moving planets are involved.

# Transits to Radix

The current position of the planets can also be interpreted relative to another chart. This might be your birth chart, or the chart for the birth of a company or a country or a television show. Radix is the fancy Latin word (meaning "root") for this birth chart. To look at transits to the birth chart:

1. Find the current degree and sign position of a planet in an ephemeris (see Chapter 2). For example: current position of Saturn is 10 degrees 39 minutes of Libra (October 2010).
2. Then, find where that degree and sign fall in your birth chart.

# Planetary cycle

First consider the cycle of the planet so you know how long its transits will affect your chart. Saturn moves at about 3 degrees per month and takes about 2½ years to move through a sign of the zodiac (because of retrograde periods). So Saturn is in a house of the horoscope for an average of 2½ years, and will probably be in exact aspect to a planet for about 10 days. However, remember orbs (see Chapter 16) They apply to transiting planets as well. So if Saturn gets within 7 degrees of making an exact square to a planet in your birth chart, you're going to be experiencing its dark and sinister hand (okay, I'm exaggerating).

Also, as you learned in Chapter 17, there are certain ages when planetary cycles converge and activate major turning or crisis points. At 35, Drew Barrymore has just reached the beginning of the age range of the "midlife crisis," ages 35 to 42. In the previous chart, we see that transiting Saturn is at 10 degrees of Libra, which is making a square aspect to Saturn at 12 degrees of Cancer in her birth chart. This is one of the critical aspects of Saturn's 29-year cycle. In the next seven years we can expect to see her coming to terms with career and life decisions, ideals that may not have panned out, and some reminders that nothing lasts forever.

# House position

Find the house in your chart that has the symbol for Libra on the cusp. In the previous chart, 10 degrees and 27 minutes of Libra is on the cusp of the fifth house. Since Saturn's current position at 10.35 Libra falls just after 10.27, transiting Saturn has just entered Drew's fifth house and will be there for a little over 2½ years.

# Interpretation of Saturn moving through the fifth house

The planet of maturity, responsibility, authority, and rules is now entering the house of creativity, expression, children, play, and entertainment. This is a transit that might initially be experienced as a wet blanket over the more enjoyable parts of life, as obstacles to enjoyment emerge and must be dealt with in order to move to the next level of maturity. One might deal with the question of having children, taking one's creative efforts more seriously, or the need to carve more time out of your busy schedule for pure recreation and fun. Generally, the path of your career may detour into fifth house realms, connecting with children, gaming, or entertainment.

Update (June 2015): Barrymore's first child, Olive Barrymore Kopelman, was born September 26, 2012, when Saturn was at 28.57 Libra—in Drew's fifth house.

Since Drew already has a career in entertainment and in fact owns her own production company, this might be a time when she decides to take her professional activities to a new and more challenging level, or in a direction that's explicitly aimed at children or gaming (fifth house). Also, she's at an age (35) when many women feel they need to have children if they're ever going to, so she might be dealing with the question of parenthood. This includes the possibility of a change in her relationship with her surviving parent, her mother.

# Aspects to natal planets

Does 10.35 Libra form a conjunction, sextile, square, trine, or opposition aspect to any planets in the birth chart? In Drew's chart, it makes a trine aspect to Mercury, a square aspect to Saturn, a sextile to Neptune, an opposition to Pluto, and a sextile to the Moon's North Node. This tells us she is in a period when:

* She finds it relatively easy (trine) to bring discipline, maturity, and organization (Saturn) to communication and learning (Mercury).
* She is at a crisis point related to her career aspirations or sense of having reached important life milestones (transiting Saturn square natal Saturn).
* She has an opportunity (sextile) to make her dreams (Neptune) a reality (Saturn).
* Her experiences of authority figures, or of being in positions of authority herself (Saturn), are currently strongly colored (conjunction) by a need to feel in control, empowered, and acting from strength and integrity (Pluto).
* She has an opportunity (sextile) to use her position of authority or influence (Saturn) to pursue a cherished work or charitable goal (Moon's North Node in sixth house).

This is an analysis of only one transiting planet to the birth chart! As you can see, this can become quite complicated. Narrow it down more easily by focusing on the transits of slower-moving planets—say, Mars through Pluto—to the birth chart.

Another popular technique for prediction is the use of progressions. Progressions don't reflect actual, physical positions of planets in the sky, as transits do. They are ways of moving your birth chart forward in time to reflect the individual's changing reality—your "progress." The most popular form of progressions are secondary progressions, which are based on the idea that each day of life after your birth reflects a year of your life. So if you were born on May 3, 1983, you would look at the transits for May 4, 1983, to describe what your life is like as of your first birthday; May 10, 1983, for your seventh birthday; and so on.

## Definition

A progression is a method of symbolically moving the birth or radix chart forward in time to reflect growth or events. Secondary progressions, also called "day-for-a-year" or major progressions, are a method of moving the birth chart forward in time to reflect your personal, unfolding growth. In secondary progressions, each day after your birth is thought to represent conditions in your life in the comparable year after your birth.

All planets and house cusps are progressed forward using this method, but the faster-moving planets (Sun through Mars) generally show the most activity. For this reason, it's thought that secondary progressions reflect your inner—especially emotional—development.

Secondary progressions mimic the cycle of the planets. Since the Sun takes about 30 days to move through a sign of the zodiac, in secondary progressions (in which a day equals a year) the Sun takes about 30 years to move through a sign of the zodiac. If you were born on the date of the vernal equinox, with the Sun in the first degree of Aries, the secondary progressed Sun would move into Taurus around the time you turn 30. If you were born with the Sun at 17 degrees of Aries, your secondary progressed Sun would enter Taurus about 13 years later (13 years = 13 degrees of motion; 13 + 17 = 30 degrees).

When working with progressions, these are the important events to look for:

* Secondary progressed planets changing sign or house
* Secondary progressed planets changing aspects to other secondary progressed planets
* Important natal aspects becoming exact by secondary progression
* Secondary progressed planets in aspect to natal planets

For example, the previous chart shows the Sun at 3° 34', or three and a half degrees, of Pisces. This tells us that when she was about 26½ years old, in 2001, the progressed Sun moved into the sign of Aries. We can expect that, at that age, there would have been a shift in Drew's personality from the dreaminess of Pisces to a more assertive, action-oriented, even impulsive personality. On July 7, 2001, with her progressed Sun in the last degrees of Pisces, she married comedian Tom Green, a union that took fans by surprise. On July 25, 2001, her progressed Sun entered Aries, a dramatic shift and the beginning of a new 30-year cycle. Fewer than six months later, the marriage ended.

# The Rule of Three

When considering whether a prediction is likely to come true, astrologers use a venerable guideline known as "The Rule of Three." If the symbolism to support the prediction appears only once, it's considered a possibility; if it appears twice, it's likely; and if it appears three times, it's a probability.


# Solar Arc Progressions/Directions

Another popular form of progressions are solar arc progressions, also called solar arc directions or degree-for-a-year progressions. These take their name from the method of calculation, in which the Sun's arc—the number of degrees and minutes it's covered since birth—is added to each natal planet to derive the solar arc progressed placement. It sounds complicated, but it's actually a very easy system to use because the Sun moves about a degree each day. If a person is 26 years old, just add 26 degrees to each natal planet and you're in the ballpark.

Because they have their basis in the movement of the Sun, solar arc progressions seem to reflect outward, physical, identifiable events. I think of them as indicating what you do in response to the motivations of the secondary progressions or the outward pressure of transits.

Unlike with secondary progressions, aspects between solar arc progressed planets don't change over time, because they're all moving at the same rate. Slow-moving planets and (often) the Ascendant and Midheaven show more motion in solar arc progressions than in secondary progressions.

When working with solar arc progressions, pay close attention to the following:
* Solar arc progressed (SA) planets making a conjunction to an angle of the chart
* SA planets changing sign
* SA planets moving into a new house of the horoscope
* Important natal aspects becoming exact by solar arc progression
* SA planets making major aspects to natal planets

!Chart

Drew Barrymore: solar arc progressions, June 11, 1982.

For example, On June 11, 1982, E.T.: The Extraterrestrial was released in theaters and made 7-year-old Drew Barrymore a sensation. Her solar arc directions for that day (see the previous chart) show the Sun in an almost exact square to Neptune. The square between the Sun and Neptune, both close to angles of the chart, is one of Drew's most important natal aspects; but at the time of her birth, the Sun was still just about 8 degrees from forming the exact aspect to Neptune. We know, then, that between the ages of about 7 to 9 (1 degree of orb approaching exact, 1 degree leaving exact), the natal promise of this dramatic aspect—the Sun so close to the highest point in the chart indicating the possibility of fame, Neptune ruling movies—will in some way be realized.

# Combining Natal, Progressions, and Transits

When you're just getting started, stick to two wheels at a time: the transits with the birth chart, the secondary progressions with the birth chart, and so on. But when you get used to reading these charts, you'll often combine the natal, progressions, and transits on a single page so you can easily compare all of their positions and look for common themes. Chart calculation programs usually offer a chart wheel option, often called a quadwheel, that displays all the information in a single chart.

The planetary placements of the birth chart, secondary and solar arc progressions, and transits give you a lot of data, and it can be challenging to sort through it all. Just as you did in Chapter 22 when you were learning to read a single birth chart, it's important to come up with a systematic approach to finding the most important progressed and transiting events. Here are the events I look for when I'm beginning this kind of analysis:

* Is the progressed Sun changing signs or houses or making an exact aspect?
* Where's the progressed Moon?
* Is the person in one of the critical life cycles described in Chapter 17?
* Are the slow-moving planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) making a conjunction to one of the angles of the chart or an aspect to one of the inner planets?
* Traffic jams—are a whole lot of things piling up in one place?

In this chart, a few things jump out at me. First of all, the progressed Sun is at 29 degrees of Pisces. This tells me Drew is getting ready for a real life overhaul, as we all do when the progressed Sun changes signs; it only happens every 30 years, and it's a big deal. Since the Sun is in the tenth house of the chart and rules the fourth, I suspect a substantial shift in her living situation and public reputation. Also, this progressed Sun is conjunct Venus in the birth chart at 29 Pisces; this can point to marriage, but also to major property decisions, both of which can affect her living situation. The progressed Sun is also making a quincunx aspect to the cusp of the fourth house; she's about to have an adjustment (quincunx) in her living situation (fourth house), and it's probably going to cost some money (Venus). There is about a two-year window of opportunity for this aspect to produce results.

Progressed Venus entered Taurus about a year ago and is getting ready to exactly oppose natal Uranus; this can point to sudden relationship developments and sudden changes in property or financial status. The window of opportunity for this is about one year.

The progressed Moon—also a symbol of home—is at 29 Gemini and is currently exactly sextile the fourth house cusp. The progressed Moon getting ready to change signs gives the suggestion of changes in her living situation, and the sextile to the IC introduces the opportunity (sextile) to explore alternatives. The window of opportunity for this aspect is one month.

Transiting Mars is within 1 degree of an opposition with Jupiter, and both are square Drew’s natal Sun (3 Pisces). This plays out over about a four- or five-day period.

Finally, on this date the transiting Sun is at 29 degrees of Aquarius, which is in exact opposition to her fourth house cusp. The transiting Sun moves quickly, 1 degree per day, so this is the only day this month that the transiting Sun will be in a major aspect to the fourth house cusp.

On this date, Drew Barrymore’s house (Moon, fourth house ruled by the Sun) caught fire and she lost most of her possessions (Venus/Uranus). And incidentally, five months later she married her fiancé, Tom Green (Sun/Venus). The marriage lasted just a few months—just long enough for the progressed Sun to move in to Aries.

# Some Final Thoughts

The philosopher Plato once said, “Perhaps there is a pattern set up in the heavens for one who desires to see it, and having seen it, to find one in himself.” What a lyrical way to think about astrology! Indeed, in a world whose state seems to be one of perpetual chaos, I find comfort in the logic and predictability of astrology’s cycles. They help me detect patterns in the world, and in myself; and when I recognize patterns, I’m in a better position to change them . When I began my study of astrology nearly 40 years ago, books were my first teachers. I’m thrilled and gratified to have had the opportunity to take you by the arm and guide you onto your own astrological path. Happy trails, and may your astrological journey be a long and fascinating one!

# Essential Takeaways

* Use good judgment in deciding whether to read charts for other people. When making predictions, balance difficult possibilities with positive ones, and don't scare the person to death.

* In astrology, transits refer to the current planetary positions. They can be interpreted relative to each other or in comparison to the planetary positions in the birth chart, where they show outer influences and situations that affect you.

* Secondary progressions posit that the planetary positions each day after your birth correspond to a year after your birth, and that these positions show your inner development and progress.

* Solar arc progressions are derived from adding the total movement of the secondary progressed Sun to each natal planet. These show your outer response to inner development and external influences.
