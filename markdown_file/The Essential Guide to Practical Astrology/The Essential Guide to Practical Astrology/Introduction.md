# Introduction

Let's begin by acknowledging the elephant in the room: there are lots of books you can read to learn the essentials of astrology. Why, you might fairly ask, should you read this one?

1. It's funny, and a bit irreverent. That's how I roll. Astrology and I have kept company for several decades now, and our relationship resembles the kind of loving but contentious rapport found between old married couples. I kid astrology, because I love it.

2. You're among friends here. I'm a fan of every sign, every planet, every asteroid (okay, I'm not nuts about Chiron, but I'm learning to respect him). You're not going to read a bunch of insulting stuff about your Sun sign or about how people with your Moon sign are more likely than others to kick their dogs. There's just no need for that kind of talk.

3. This is a guide to practical astrology. That means it's written in plain English, illustrated with real-world examples of astrology in action. Stuff you can use, today, to better understand yourself, other people, and your world.

# Practical Astronomy

Once upon a time, astrology and astronomy were one. Astronomers plotted various objects in the sky, and astrologers figured out what they meant to life on earth. Astrology was, in fact, known as "practical astronomy." The thinking was presumably something like, "It's all good and well to know where Saturn is, but what does that mean for me?" After all, life was hard, back when a simple slice of buttered toast represented an impressive amount of work–cultivating and milling wheat, chopping firewood to light the oven, baking bread, spending hours bent over a churn to produce one sad little lump of butter. No one would encourage a son or daughter to spend a lifetime studying the movements of the stars and planets unless it was going to benefit the tribe in some practical way. So, astrologers noted that when Saturn was moving through a particular constellation, harvests were meager or money was tight or livestock were sluggish about reproducing. They noticed that crops grew better when they were planted during paticular lunar phases or while the Moon was in a particular sign.  They warned the village to stockpile pitchforks and lighted torches when Mars rose in the morning sky, and to keep an eye out for war-making overtures from neighboring tribes.

# Impractical Astrology

There are still plenty of practical uses for astrology. Astrologers still use the symbolism of the skies to predict wars, anticipate tense moments in animal husbandry, and to monitor the ebb and flow of money and other resources. True, most of us no longer churn our own butter or have to protect our families with a pitchfork. But it can be handy to know the best times to push for a raise or take a vacation

But are there impractical uses for astrology? It's tempting to say yes. There doesn't seem to be anything practical about key chains with the signs of the zodiac on them or the horoscopes in your daily paper. Even the loftier goals of modern astrology, such as self-understanding, seem more of a luxury than a necessity. But what's more practical than a system that helps you choose a job or partner that suits you? Or to appreciate your innate strengths and weaknesses, so that you can capitalize on one and compensate for the other? That just sounds like good sense, to me. Most astrological journeys begin with a single book—one that you find at the right moment of your life, and that speaks to you in your own language. I hope that this will be that book for you, and that our meeting between these pages will mark the beginning of your life-long love affair with astrology. Enjoy it all!

# How To Use This Book

This book covers a lot of territory. If you're like most people, you want to understand yourself and a few people close to you, and that's it. And you want it now. I respect that. The book is written and organized in such a way that you can either read it from start to finish or dip into the parts that pertain specifically to fascinating you, and then be on your way.

As you forage through this book, reading about the various features of your birth chart, you'll run across contradictions. That doesn't mean astrology doesn't work; it means you're complicated, and astrology is complex enough to reflect that. Sometimes, and in some situations, you behave one way; in other situations, you behave differently. You want different things from different areas of your life. You contain multitudes.

This book is divided into six parts:

## Part 1, Astrology as a Second Language

introduces you to the idea of astrology. What is it? What's it based on? Why is your horoscope always wrong? How can you get a copy of your birth chart? And what is your birth chart? The chapters in Part 1 set the stage for understanding everything else that follows. If you get lost along the way, backtrack to these chapters to find your answer.

## Part 2, Signs of the Zodiac

gives a rundown of those familiar favorites, the signs of the zodiac. Here's where it gets very tempting for you to dip in and just read about "your sign." Resist this impulse, because here's a secret: they're all your sign. Yep, each and every sign—even the one you hate because it's your old boyfriend's sign, and he was really mean to you—is represented in some part of your birth chart.

## Part 3, A Place for Everything: Houses

introduces you to the houses of the horoscope, which symbolize where stuff happens in your life. If you're a Sun sign Cancer but you want to understand why your friends all think of you as a Leo, to paraphrase Apple, "there's a house for that"—the House of Friendship. The good news is that the 12 houses of the horoscope cover some of the same territory as the signs of the zodiac, so there's less new ground to cover.

## Part 4, Gods and Monsters: Planets

leads you into the valley of the planets, including the Sun and Moon. This is where things really start to get interesting. Each planet of our solar system (and yes, that includes Pluto) symbolizes some motivation or need in your life—love, attention, survival, gossip. Find out which sign and house they’re in, and how they relate to each other, and watch astrology really come to life!

# Part 5, Cycles Made Simple

gives you some tools for understanding the cycles of astrology and how they reflect cycles in your own life. There's a daily planner to help you follow the Moon through the signs of the zodiac and anticipate the day's "mood." The monthly planner follows the Sun, Mercury, Venus, and the phases of the Moon; it can help you figure out how to get noticed, listened to, and loved this month, as well as when to start things and when to finish what you're already started. The yearly planner enlists the help of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn to help you formulate the kinds of substantial goals that you'll be proud to include in your holiday newsletter. And the long-range planner shows you how using the cycles of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto can help you anticipate major turning points in your life.

# Part 6, Bringing It All Together

gives you an easy lesson in astrological grammar, shows you how to put all the different symbols together, and includes an example of how to analyze a birth chart. Then you learn some of the cool stuff astrologers use to make predictions. This may be a little over your head right now, but keep this book around; if you decide to move forward from the strict basics of astrology, this material represents the next logical step in your journey.

You'll also find three helpful appendixes: a glossary of astrological terms; tables of upcoming planetary activity, including New Moons and eclipses; and a directory of resources for further astrological learning.

# Acknowledgments

I keep finding myself in the curious position of writing books I never dreamed of writing—entirely thanks to people who have more faith in my abilities than I do. This naturally includes the crack team at Alpha/Penguin, especially my brilliant and funny editors, Lynn Northrup and Randy Ladenheim-Gil, who curbed my excesses without breaking my spirit. Thanks also to my agent, Marilyn Allen of Allen O'Shea; and to Sharon Leah, whose encouragement over the years has helped nudge me from amusing myself in Internet obscurity to amusing myself in print, in front of all of you nice people.

Much gratitude and love to my astrological heroes, mentors, and colleagues, especially Diane Ronngren, Dana Gerhardt, Steven Forrest, Bill Herbst, Jeffrey Kishner, Lynn Hayes, Jim Shawvan, Simone Butler, and Jessica Shepherd. Each of you has inspired me to be a better astrologer, writer, and person, and you have my thanks. I'm also indebted to a couple of my favorite non astrological writers, Joe Queenan and Sandra Tsing-Loh—so inspiringly witty, acerbic, and marvelous.



Thanks to Matrix Software and Astrodienst for the astrological charts and tables used in the book.

# The overwhelming consensus

The overwhelming consensus among my family and friends is that astrology is a pretty strange way to earn a living, but since it seems to pay the bills and keeps me (more or less) out of trouble, they mostly shrug and offer their moral support. A doff of the cap, then, to Drew Elliott and Heather Galluzzi, Mari Stroud, Kathy McLaughlin, Chuck Emery, Tim Tormey, Natori Moore, John A. Rippo, Lori Rodefer, Doug Adair, and Frank Gualco—for coffee, donuts, glasses of wine, chocolate, good-natured insults, and rousing cheers. Most of all, thanks to Jonny Kent—patient and funny, a great cook, cute as anything, and lots of fun to live with. Marrying you was the best day's work I've ever done.

After the first edition of this book went out of print in late 2013, I found myself in possession of the rights to the manuscript but no clue what to do next. Thankfully, my friends Diane Ronngren and Gary Dunham of ETC Publishing came to the rescue! Many warm thanks to them for all their support and skill in bringing new life to my beloved text-child—the latest in their long history of kindnesses toward me.
