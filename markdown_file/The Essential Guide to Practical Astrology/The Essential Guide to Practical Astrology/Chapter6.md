## Air Signs

Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius are the air signs: bright, communicative, and sociable

Gemini is quick, witty, and skilled with words

Libra is refined, diplomatic, and persuasive

Aquarius is friendly, unconventional, and independent. In nature, air is the most immediately necessary element. We can live without food, water, and heat much longer than we can live without air. Apart from enabling a bodily function necessary for basis survival, air helps pollinate the plants that produce our food, and bears ideas and information from one person to another.

Walk outside on a breezy afternoon, and stand under some trees in a quiet place. Listen the wind rustling the leaves of the trees … it's the sound of the world talking to you. Sometimes it speaks a little too emphatically, in destructive tornadoes and hurricanes.

The three signs that are associated with the air element are designed to move the air around—talking, exchanging ideas, creating a breeze as they move around from one place to another. Their realms—relational, communicative—initially seem less important, somehow, than the hard earth, the nourishing water, or warming fire. But just as we can't live without air for more than a matter of seconds, our souls would asphyxiate without another soul to talk to.

And having someone, or something, to talk to can be the difference between living and dying. In the film Cast Away, Tom Hanks plays a plane-crash survivor who, having washed ashore on a remote and deserted island, creates a companion out of a volleyball and delivers monologues to it a la Hamlet and the skull. When the volleyball is lost at sea, the Hanks characters weeps as though for a human friend.

# Gemini, the Twins

The Sun moves into Gemini in late May, just about the time kids get out of school and start running around the neighborhood, when the first hot days signal summer's eminent arrival and birds and bees swarm lazily, drunk with pollen, around gardens in riotous bloom. Like the high voices of chattering kids at play, zooming around on their bicycles and skateboards, or birds, bees, and the wind carrying pollen from plant to plant, Gemini symbolizes a time of year when seeds—of plants, of flowers, of grass, of ideas—are carried from place to place.

The constellation Gemini is illuminated by two bright stars, named after the mythical twins Castor and Pollux, twins born of different fathers. The first of the relational air signs, Gemini symbolizes the first relationships we form outside of our parental bonds—relationships with our brothers and sisters, neighbors, classmates, and eventually co-workers. When we become infatuated with ourselves, these peers cut us down to size. They teach us the talismanic power of words, of promises and proprietary claims, of nicknames and teasing. Identical twins are famous for developing secret languages no one else can understand, but spend 10 minutes with any pair of siblings, or kids who went to grade school together, and you'll quickly encounter an impenetrable fog of in-jokes and verbal shortcuts.

Gemini rules communication—the skills of encoding and decoding messages, of understanding our world and making ourselves understood. Our earliest social interactions teach us how to argue and negotiate, how to twist the knife, how to tell a joke, and how far we can go without completely alienating someone.

You are most likely to identify with the sign of Gemini if 
* You were born with the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant in Gemini or in close aspect to Mercury.
* You were born with a number of planets in the third house.
* You were born with Mercury in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house.

Gemini thrives on information and ideas. Like a young child learning to read, Gemini finds the whole world is endlessly fascinating. Gemini has a love of language and of vehicles that share ideas from person to person, such as books, magazines, computers, and telephones. It's the sign associated with "lower" or practical learning, such as K-12 education or trade school in which basic skills and literacy are taught.

Like a kid on summer vacation, Gemini is easily bored. He needs variety in his routine and gets squirmy when asked to do one thing at a time. He flourishes with constant changes of scenery, and Gemini is associated with short trips and the modes of transportation that make them possible—cars, motorcycles, bikes, trains, buses, and skateboards.

Gemini at its best: Curious, inquisitive, quick witted, communicative, inventive, clever, adaptable

Gemini on a bad day: Verbally cruel, deceptive, disloyal, restless, doesn't follow through

# How to Spot a Gemini

Gemini listens best when listening to two things at once, or while working with his hands. Gemini can literally watch TV while surfing the Internet and talking on the phone, and generally pays better attention to all three when doing them simultaneously. Boredom leads to distraction for Gemini. Gemini can sometimes find it hard to make eye contact while he's talking, and will look over your shoulder or into the distance while telling you something. Generally, however, he'll watch you with rapt absorption while you talk.

Gemini is always busy. In a meeting, he will be doodling or checking e-mail. At a party, he's happiest carrying food and drink from person to person, with lots of opportunities to eavesdrop on conversations.

Gossip, trivia, and word games are chicken soup for the Gemini soul. This is the sign that loves a game of Jeopardy, Scrabble, or Trivial Pursuit. A Gemini who doesn't get enough positive social interaction can become a bit of a gossip, pollinating the neighborhood with second-hand news and haunting celebrity gossip websites. Steering this sort of Gemini into a journalism, research, or working with the public puts this natural curiosity to more productive use.

**The Gemini archetype**: The jester; clever and mischievous, your wit and agility are your best defense

**The Gemini stereotype**: The meddlesome neighbor, snooping and eavesdropping

_Astro Tip_

A note about "two-faced" Gemini: Gemini is facile and shape shifting, as its rulership by Mercury suggests. He's easily bored and restless by nature, but he isn't necessarily a cad. You can win Gemini's loyalty easily enough: just be interesting, stimulating, and multifaceted.

# Gemini in Love

In matters of the heart, Gemini has acquired something of a "love 'em and leave 'em" reputation that's not entirely fair. It's true that Gemini craves variety, but that need can be fulfilled easily by one partner who is intellectually compatible, who is a good listener, and—most importantly—can keep Gemini entertained. If you're smart and funny, quick witted, good with words, well read, and well spoken, you'll have no problem keeping Gemini satisfied.

Gemini is always interesting and amusing, or at least laughs at your jokes if you are amusing. A Gemini person likes to do things, whether it's going out to see a movie, window shopping, or visiting a farmer's market. Gemini is usually a good communicator, too. You won't have to sit around wondering what Gemini is thinking; he'll spend his life telling you!

On the other hand, there is the "easily bored" thing. Gemini is a restless sign, and if you're not smart and funny—or at least smart enough to appreciate his wit—you may not go the distance. Boredom is the kiss of death for Gemini, so he has to free and encouraged to spend time with friends.

Most compatible signs: Fellow air signs Libra and Aquarius, who share your desire for relationships based on qualities of the mind; fire signs Aries and Leo, who are action-oriented and outgoing enough to keep you interested

Most challenging signs: Fellow mutable signs. Opposite sign Sagittarius is too sure of his beliefs to enjoy mental sparring, Virgo spends too much time on individual topics or activities, and Pisces can be too ethereal and sensitive.

# Gemini at Work

Gemini is known for being clever with language, but what's less appreciated is his overall quickness and facility both with words and with machinery. Sometimes Gemini energy manifests itself through brilliant ideas, writing and speaking skill, and linguistic cleverness.

But Gemini is also a kind of "machine whisperer," possessing a sure touch with equipment (especially communication equipment, like computers). All the air signs are pretty good at making computers work, and Gemini's skill is in his intuitive grasp of how gizmos "talk" to one another. He's the sort of fellow that can set up his own Internet connection and is an early adopter of new technology.

Of all the signs, though, Gemini is the least happy when forced to do the same thing day after day in the same way. Gemini needs a job that, for a significant portion of the day, allows him to wander around to different locations, chatting with people. The acme of a Gemini profession would be a mail carrier, walking around the neighborhood delivering information to folks and chatting with them along the way.

Gemini-friendly careers: Gemini has a natural affinity for careers related to ideas, words, or manual dexterity. He's at home in journalism, communication, linguistics, languages, or writing.

Advertising and marketing (Gemini is especially good at naming things) is a good fit for Gemini's mental agility. His manual skill makes him adept at working with computers or other machines. Gemini is a skillful networker, connecting people with resources or information.

You'll also find Gemini working in professions that allow him to move around a lot, especially ground transportation, such as driving a cab or working on a train.

Ω

In the northern hemisphere, the Sun enters tropical Libra at the vernal equinox, when day and night are equal. It's about balance and equality. A partner balances one's own qualities, so Libra is a sign of equal yet complementary relationships between romantic and business partners, and also between open enemies. It's also the time of year when crops are taken to market, so Libra has to do with negotiating with others.

Libra is the only sign of the zodiac that's symbolized by an inanimate object. Its symbol, the scales, were originally considered part of the constellation Scorpio, representing the scorpion's claws. In ancient Egypt, the scales were a symbol of justice used to weigh the souls of the dead against the feather of truth. Coming before the sign Scorpio, symbolizing death and rebirth, the scales of Librans justice seem especially fitting.

You are most likely to identify with the sign of Libra if

* You were born with the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant in Libra or in close aspect to Venus.
* You were born with a number of planets in the seventh house.
* You were born with Venus in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house.

# What Makes Libra Tick

As its symbol, the Scales, suggests, Libra is committed to achieving balance. This is why Libra is not always as sweet as her reputation—it usually balances excessive niceness with confrontation. This is also behind Libra's reputation for argumentativeness. But it can also be a harmonious trait, when Libra finds a way to match her strengths with another person's weaknesses. Libra defines herself by what she's not (other people) versus what she is, so can have trouble finding a strong sense of self and standing her ground.

Libra is the sign that comes after discerning Virgo on the horoscopic wheel, and it incorporates that sign's refined tastes. Libra is generally horrified by uncouth behavior and coarse language and sets a great store by behaving like a "lady" or "gentleman." A sign of ethics, fairness, and justice, Libra believes there is a right way to behave and a wrong way—and sorting through the various shades of gray in between wrong and right is exactly what Libra is designed to do.

Libra at its best: Refined, artistic, diplomatic, sociable, peace loving, persuasive, just

Libra on a bad day: Fickle, over accommodating, argumentative, indecisive, insincere

## How to Spot a Libra

The typical Libran is pleasant, well dressed, smells good, with a dimpling smile and graceful manners. So graceful, in fact, that you hardly notice you're in an argument with Libra until you've already lost. Libra does an exceptionally good job of buttering you up first, so the sting of defeat is a lot less painful.

While they play the role of perfect lady or gentleman impeccably, Libras inhabit both gender roles with aplomb. At a party, you'll find the Libra man chatting with the ladies, and the Libra woman holding her own with the guys. Libra men generally have a strong interest in music, art, or cooking; Libra women can be exceptionally tough and ambitious businesswomen.

The contrarian of the zodiac, Libra automatically takes the opposite side of an issue and can debate either side equally well. Libra truly enjoys an argument; she loves to really examine both sides of an issue. Without a strong sense of self, Libra can easily lose track of her real convictions. Her most valuable companions are those who encourage her to take a stand and advocate on behalf of strongly held principles.

The Libra archetype : The diplomat

The Libra stereotype : The gigolo or "kept" man or woman

## Libra in Love

In love, Libra seeks an equal partner—usually, one with strong opinions and decisiveness. Libra is a natural at love and relationship. You're very alert to your partner's opinions and preferences, extremely thoughtful, and romantic without being sentimental. Saturn, the planet of commitment and maturity, is at its strongest in Libra, so this is one of the signs that is naturally made for marriage or other committed, long-term relationships.

Not all Librans find love and live in perfect harmony, ever after. Because you have a hard time making decisions, you may choose a very decisive partner and then feel railroaded into agreeing with his or her decisions. Your lack of sentimentality and raw emotion can be alienating to a water sign or air sign partner, while an earth sign partner would prefer someone who will fix her computer to someone who can write a sonnet for her.

Most compatible signs: Fellow air signs Gemini and Aquarius, who are at ease with Libra's breezy, communicative level of intimacy; fire signs Leo and Sagittarius, who enjoy Libra's flattery while encouraging you to have the courage of your convictions

Most challenging signs : Your fellow cardinal signs. Aries, your opposite sign, can be abrasive and lacks diplomacy; Cancer and Capricorn tend to see things in black and white, where you prefer shades of gray.

Libra has a sweet reputation that is not necessarily deserved. Her job is to balance the attitudes of others; if she is dealing with someone who is extremely accommodating, for instance, she will usual compensate by being demanding—even though it goes against her essential nature. For Libra, the desire for balance overrides even her passion for harmony.

# Libra at Work

Because Libra is so attuned to what other people are doing and uses those observations to define yourself, you keep a keen eye on your competition and are always striving to get—and stay—ahead. Libra is highly competitive—a trait that often surprises those who have taken your smooth and flattering personality at face value.

It's because of that surface smoothness that Libra is especially good at pleasing customers and clients. You have a pleasing way about you that can disarm practically anyone, no matter how prickly. As a character on the TV show Mad Men explained in comparing a young account manager to his rival, "You're very good at solving our customers' problems. But [your rival] has the rare gift of making them feel that they haven't any problems." This is precisely the quality that makes Libra an unusually gifted marketer or public service representative.

Libra prefers to work independently or with a partner, not in groups, where too many points of view must be carefully weighed. It's also important to note that just because Libra is the sign of partnership and of harmonious relationships doesn't mean you're a pushover. In fact, like all the cardinal signs, Librans prefer to take the lead in their work. One Libra I knew was fond of quoting Thomas Paine: "Lead, follow, or get out of my way." Libra can work well with a trusted partner, and in fact you're at your best when you have someone to brainstorm with. But the hierarchy must be firmly established in advance—preferably with yourself at the top of the pyramid.

Libra-friendly careers: A sign of justice, Libra excels in careers related to law, justice, contracts, mediation, negotiation, and arbitration. Libra's refined taste lends itself to work in the beauty industry: cosmetics, jewelry, fashion, esthetics, interior design, and apparel. Fine art and music appeal to Libra, as well as careers that require an ability to read people, such as marketing, public relations, and human resources.

# Aquarius, the Water Bearer

In the northern hemisphere, the Sun is in Aquarius in the dead of winter. The cold, short days and long nights encourage people to gather together for storytelling, camaraderie, and warmth. In extreme climates and circumstances, people can in fact die without this kind of companionship. February, when the Sun is in Aquarius for most of the month, is named for Februa, the Roman feast of purification. It's one of the rainiest months of the year, and Aquarius's symbolism is connected to cleansing and renewal.

Aquarius is symbolized by the Water Bearer, a figure pouring water from a jug into a larger body of water. Aquarius wants to share his knowledge (symbolized by the water being poured from one jug) with the greatest possible number of people (the larger body of water).

The last of the relational air signs, Aquarius's realm is community—networks of people who on some level share our interests. We may have shared the same college fraternity, employment with a particular company, or interest in a sport, career, or hobby. If we've crossed paths with a person, that's basis enough for an Aquarian relationship. It's the sign of friendship—not necessarily of close, abiding soul connections, but simply of shared interests.

You are most likely to identify with the sign of Aquarius if

* You were born with the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant in Aquarius or in close aspect to Uranus.
* You were born with a number of planets in the eleventh house.
* You were born with Uranus in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house.

Because it's symbolized by a human figure pouring water from a jug, Aquarius is often mistaken for a water sign. It is actually an air sign, and the water in its symbol and the waves of its glyph are thought to suggest the flow of knowledge.

# What Makes Aquarius Tick

Aquarius is a sign of acute contradictions. On one hand, Aquarius is a sociable air sign, especially attuned to working with groups and teams. On the other hand, Aquarians consider themselves unique and often find it difficult to really fit in anywhere. Aquarius seems to end up as one of the few hippies in a conservative town, or as a religious fundamentalist in a family of atheists, or some other contradictory situation where they're just not like everyone else.

These contradictions are inherent in the contradictory planets that share rulership of Aquarius.
Saturn, the ruler of Aquarius before the discovery of Uranus, is the planet of rules and structure. Uranus, Aquarius's modern day ruler, is the planet of rebellion and iconoclasm. Aquarius wants to be unique and break the rules, but of course, you have to know what the rules are before you can break them. Indeed, Aquarius may hold views that are radically different than those of the people around you; but as a fixed sign, you will defend those views to the death, and are generally impossible to sway from your opinions.

Aquarius at its best: Independent, genius, iconoclastic, rebellious, logical, scientific, progressive, intellectual, humane

Aquarius on a bad day: Eccentric, temperamental, unpredictable, cold, opinionated, radical

# How to Spot Aquarius

There's a joke that goes something like this: Bob is bragging to his friend Joe that he knows everyone on the planet. "Do you know the pope?" Joe challenges him. "Sure!" Bob answers, and takes his friend to the Vatican to prove it. When the pope emerges and greets a massive throng that has gathered beneath his window, Bob is standing by his side. Down below, the man standing next to Joe elbows him and asks, "Hey—who's the guy in the funny hat with Bob?"

Aquarius knows everyone. I call a friend of mine, with Aquarius rising, "Mr. San Diego" because I literally can't mention anyone in the city without him saying, "Oh yeah, I know so-and-so." Going out with him anywhere requires numerous delays and detours as we encounter a succession of his old friends, schoolmates, and business acquaintances.

Aquarians can be a little eccentric in dress or demeanor. They're not necessarily wacky looking; sometimes it's quite the opposite, and you're charmingly anachronistic and dapper—the young men carrying a watch fob, the young woman in cat's eye glasses and a poodle skirt. But somehow, even when he's dressed in completely ordinary clothing, Aquarius manages to look like nobody else.

The Aquarius archetype: The charismatic rebel who wins over his fellow men by thumbing his nose at authority

The Aquarius stereotype: The mad scientist

## Aquarius in Love

As a fixed sign, Aquarius can be very loyal and constant in love. But Aquarius is usually most successful at marriage when you've had a chance to mature, though some can also do well if you marry an older, more mature partner.

Above all, Aquarius needs a lover who is also a friend. Since Aquarians are generally independent and treasure time spent alone, you need partners who are comfortable with this. Ideally, Aquarius's partner should have lots of friends and interests to bring to the relationship—and to keep him or her out of your hair!

Your lovers may find they have to fight to get time alone with you. You usually travel with an entourage of friends, and anyone who will find that kind of arrangement threatening would probably be a difficult match for Aquarius. Your best match will be someone with a full, active social life and who is willing to share it with a quirky, interesting Aquarian like you.

Most compatible signs: Your fellow air signs, Gemini and Libra, share your love of socializing, while fire signs Aries and Sagittarius appeal to your brash, freedom-and-adventure loving side.

Most challenging signs: Your fellow fixed signs. Leo, your opposite sign, needs to feel special to you and won't like spending all your time together in groups. Taurus and Scorpio are private, a little possessive, and tend to dislike socializing except with intimate friends.

# Aquarius at Work

Aquarius is a collaborative sign by nature, and you do your best work when you're around other people. You can work independently as long as there are plenty of opportunities to socialize. Aquarius is one of the few signs that really seems to enjoy office parties; you're also likely to become involved in the political structure of your workplace, such as employee-run organizations or bargaining groups.

As a fixed sign, Aquarius flourishes in a work environment with well-established routines. However, you need to feel that you're free to change the routines whenever you choose. You may enjoy contract positions that allow you to work indefinitely at a work site, while still feeling you can easily leave at any time.

Aquarius is an innovator. You have a knack for organizing ideas into forms that will really spark the imagination of large groups of people. Aquarius is a science-and-technology-oriented sign, and you thrive in innovative environments surrounded by people who are a bit quirky and thinking differently.

Aquarius-friendly careers: Aquarius's love for innovation makes you a good fit for work in electronics, engineering, aerospace, science, and computer engineering and development. Your ability to connect with large groups of people lends itself to work in media and broadcasting, human resources, politics, social work, and community relations. Astrology is also associated with Aquarius!
