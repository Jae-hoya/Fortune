How signs and houses work with aspects

Planets move at different speeds, moving past each other, saluting from across the ecliptic. Their proximity to each other is always changing. When they reach particular angular relationships to each other along the zodiac, we call this proximity the "aspect," or angular relationship, between planets.

Planets in aspect are like characters in a play who have dialogue with each other. They are in some way acquainted. Perhaps they get along well, sometimes they torment one another, they might fall in love or get in a fight. One thing's for certain: they are not indifferent to one another.

## Rules of Engagement

In astrological grammar, the faster-moving planet aspects the slower-moving planet. The Moon aspects everyone; Mercury aspects everyone but the Sun; the Sun aspects Venus through Pluto; Venus aspects Mars through Pluto. You get the idea.

When a faster-moving planet is within a certain number of degrees of an exact aspect to a slower-moving planet, we say it's making an approaching, or applying aspect. These are usually more powerful aspects than separating ones, because they refer to energy that is gathering momentum, and the suspense of building toward a particular moment.

After the aspect is exact and the faster planet begins moving away, the aspect is separating. There's still a connection, but it's reached its peak of intensity and its influence is waning. Think of a girl who's left her boyfriend to go away to college; the longer she's away, the more remote the connection between them and the dimmer the memories of their courtship.

# Finding Planetary Aspects

For my money, planetary aspects are the richest, most fascinating, and most reliable dimension of astrology. Signs and houses are extremely valuable, but in a pinch, an astrologer can glean an awful lot from just knowing the relationships between the planets in a chart.

In teaching astrology, I've found that planetary aspects are a kind of moment of truth that marks the dividing line between serious students and those who are happy knowing a little bit more than the signs of the zodiac. That's because aspects bring us into the realm of 3-D astrology and its terrifying suburb, geometry. But relax. I mastered planetary aspects before I learned anything at all about geometry.

Easy aspects generally occur between planets in signs that are compatible: air with fire, water with earth. There are exceptions to this rule. Oppositions occur between planets of compatible element that are on opposite sides of the chart. Also, because there is a little leeway given between exact aspects, it's possible for a planet at the end of one sign to be in difficult aspect to a planet at the beginning of another sign, even if those signs are compatible. This is called a dissociate, or out-of-sign aspect.

## Dissociate

Dissociate or out-of-sign aspects are between planets that are in aspect but whose signs are not in the same relationship. For example, a trine aspect naturally occurs between planets in signs of the same element. But a planet at the end of Aquarius (an air sign) can form a trine aspect to a planet in the first degrees of Cancer (a water sign).

# An Aspect Grid

When you have your chart calculated by a computer program, it will usually spit out a convenient grid showing the aspects between planets. It'll look something like this:

```
오
벗
Δ L
♂ Δ *
Ψ Δ * L
♅ □ Δ * /
MC □ Δ * □ *
Asc ∨ Δ × □ Δ □
♂ Δ 오 오 24 h ♅ Ψ * Mc Ast
```

Read the grid from left to right and top to bottom. The column underneath the symbol for the Moon shows the aspects from the Moon to the slower-moving planets on the right. If you see a lot of triangles and stars in this column, your Moon plays well with the other planets; if there are a lot of squares and little things that look like barbells or side views of picnic tables, you've got a Moon that's a little cranky.

# Orbs: How Close Is Close Enough?

You and an attractive stranger live in the same city, but up to now you haven't met. Then one evening you find yourselves at an art exhibition. If you were planets, you'd have just entered one another's orb. For the first 20 minutes, you work the room at different speeds, never noticing one another. Then the stranger stops next to a potted palm, and as you're reaching for a glass of chardonnay, you both look up and notice each other from across the room. The orb is getting tighter. Gradually, you each work your way across the room, greeting friends, spilling wine on the carpet, until you're close enough to introduce yourselves. The aspect is exact.

# Orbs: How Close Is Close Enough?

You and an attractive stranger live in the same city, but up to now you haven't met. Then one evening you find yourselves at an art exhibition. If you were planets, you'd have just entered one another's orb. For the first 20 minutes, you work the room at different speeds, never noticing one another. Then the stranger stops next to a potted palm, and as you're reaching for a glass of chardonnay, you both look up and notice each other from across the room. The orb is getting tighter. Gradually, you each work your way across the room, greeting friends, spilling wine on the carpet, until you're close enough to introduce yourselves. The aspect is exact.

Orbs are tricky. Not all astrologers agree on the number of degrees on either side of an exact aspect that two planets need to have to be considered "in aspect." Some astrologers might say that you and the attractive stranger were not in orb until you get within wine-spilling distance; others feel you were in orb from the time you both found yourselves living in the same city. Most astrologers use different orbs for different kinds of aspects, and some might adjust orbs depending on the planet itself. The orbs provided in the rest of this chapter are merely guidelines; in time you'll form your own opinions on the subject, so you can hold your own in any group of screaming astrologers.

The only thing that can animate a group of astrologers more than the great house system debate (see Chapter 8) is the subject of planetary orbs. A standard rule of thumb gives major aspects (conjunction, square, trine, opposition) an orb of 7 degrees. The sextile and quincunx (discussed later in the chapter) are given an orb of 5 degrees, and minor aspects only 1 degree. Some astrologers (the ones with a strong Jupiter) favor much more generous orbs, while others (with a strong Saturn or lots of Virgo planets) hew to tighter orbs.

## Easy Aspects

Flowing, compatible, do not interfere with one another, enabling... having some easy aspects in your chart is like having some oil in your car's engine: it keeps the works running smoothly, without making dreadful screeching noises and ruining the metal. However, having too many easy aspects is like being a spoiled rich kid who's had everything handed to him his whole life, has never had to work for anything, and has never paid consequences for any of his actions.

# A Planetary Dinner Party

Aspects can be hard to visualize. So to illustrate them, I've used a familiar setting: the family dinner party, shown in the following figure. Imagine all the planets are guests—the usual collection of siblings, cousins, mothers, children, and even pets—and that the dining table is the wheel of a birth chart. Each guest has a relationship to the others that's represented by the seating arrangement. Two guests sitting opposite each other have an "opposition" relationship; they are sitting 180 degrees apart. Two guests sharing the same bench have a conjunction relationship; they are sitting 0 degrees apart.

Will sesquiquadrate warfare break out between Pete's girlfriend Marge and his sister, Janet? Will the contentious square aspect between them prompt Uncle Hank to throw a dinner roll at Ted? Use this planetary seating chart as your guide to the cast of characters I'll return to in this chapter. The planets in your own chart may be sitting in different seats at the table, but they share many of the same relationships as this family.

# Conjunction

Degrees of separation: 0°

Recommended orb: 7°

Key concepts : Beginnings, fusion, melding, intensity, concentration, drive, emphasis

By far the easiest aspect to spot in a chart, planets in a conjunction are sitting right next to each other at the same degree of the same sign. They've been thrown into a room together, and they're standing toe to toe and eye to eye.

The conjunction is more of a neutral aspect than an easy one, actually. Planets in a conjunction are like members of the same family: they share a strong connection, history, and genetics, but not necessarily compatible personalities. As you know from Thanksgiving dinners past, you can have a lot in common with your family—even love them—without actually getting along that well.

For example, seat your chatty, restless younger brother Carl (Mercury) next to glowering, taciturn Uncle Hank (Saturn) at the Thanksgiving table. And I do mean next to him—you ran out of chairs, and the two have to share a piano bench you dragged in from the living room. Will Mercury find a way to engage Saturn in conversation? Or will Saturn win the day and silence your chattering brother with a chilly glance?

Much depends on the sign where the conjunction is taking place, and whether or not one of these planets is stronger in that sign than the other. If the sign is Gemini, where Mercury is strong, then Carl's indefatigable gift of gab will win the day and his chattering will drive Uncle Hank half mad. If the sign is Capricorn, then Saturn rules; Uncle Hank will settle the kid down with a dirty look and finally get some peace and quiet. However, if the sign is Aquarius, which is a comfortable sign for both Mercury and Saturn, your brother will hit on a topic (finance, taxidermy) that will draw Uncle Hank out, and both will be happy.

# Sextile

Degree of separation: 60° (two signs)
Recommended orb: 5°

Key concepts: Opportunity, attraction, friendship, expression, spark

Sitting two seats away from Carl and Uncle Hank, at a 60-degree angle, is ravishing, charming cousin Angela (Venus). Carl loves nothing more than to tease Angela, and she takes it with good humor. He would have preferred to sit next to her at dinner, but as it is, he can still manage to chat with her if works at it. He has to crane his neck around Uncle Hank and Aunt Leticia (more about her later) and holler a little bit, but he still manages to throw some witticisms toward Angela, and she giggles appreciatively.

Two planets separated by 60 degrees are in sextile aspect. The sextile usually occurs between planets that are in complementary signs but not the same element—fire with air, and earth with water. My teacher once described the sextile has being like a cross between a trine and a square; it yields the gifts of a trine if you're willing to do the work of a square. Planets in sextile are usually in signs of compatible element; temperamentally, they aren't exactly alike, but they're complementary.

Carl (Mercury) and Angela (Venus) are in a sextile aspect. They still get to have fun with each other, but it takes a little work.

| Pisces              | Taurus, Capricorn               |

"Easy" aspects aren't always "good." Easy aspects point to noninterference. For instance, the chart for the 9/11 attacks had a lot of harmonious aspects to Mercury (the planet of transportation and logistics), and those horrific events were noteworthy for the ease with which the hijackers carried out their mission.


# Trine

Degrees of separation: 120°
Recommended orb: 7°

Key concepts: Flow, ease, harmony, laziness, inspiration, noninterference

Sitting two seats to Angela's right is your other brother, Pete (Neptune). Carl and Pete have a clear eye line to one another and have no problem communicating all through dinner, even though they can't easily chat with each other. Their in-jokes and body language work together to give them an almost telepathic rapport, and they regularly burst into laughter. Pete's easy going and gentle, but Carl brings out his mischievous side. They spend the entire dinner rolling their eyes every time Angela's husband Ted opens his mouth (more about him later).

Carl (Mercury) and Pete (Neptune) have a trine aspect between them. The trine, which normally occurs between planets in signs that share the same element, indicates ease, harmony, and instinctive rapport. Carl and Pete don't have to work at their interaction at all—they totally get each other, and are seated in such a way that they can see each other clearly and communicate. Of course, when they've both had a little too much wine and start horsing around, tossing rolls at each other, everyone might wish they didn't get along quite so well.

# Difficult Aspects

Difficult or "hard" aspects symbolize an uneasy relationship between planets in signs that have little in common. They're often in signs of the same quality, but of different elements; so they want some of the same things, but they go about them in very different ways.

Difficult aspects represent challenges that must be overcome—both the challenges that the world throws at you and the challenge of your own inner conflicts. Difficulties can make you Chapter 16: Planetary Aspects 9 angry, frustrated, and driven, but they can also motivate you to get things done. (As my mom used to say, "If you didn't have any problems, you'd never get anything done.") So don't be wary of the difficult aspects in your chart; many can be stressful, but you need a few to motivate you and build character.


"Hard" aspects aren't always negative, though they may feel that way. On the contrary, hard aspects build character in the same way pumping iron builds muscles.

## Square

Degree of separation: 90° (four signs)

Recommended orb: 7°

Key concepts: Accomplishments, breakthroughs, action, tension, challenge, friction Sitting at cousin Angela's right is her husband Ted (Jupiter). Ted doesn't enjoy conversation; he enjoys giving monologues. He's a happy, boisterous guy, but he does have a way of dominating the conversation. Both Carl (Mercury) and Uncle Hank (Saturn) find Ted intensely annoying—Uncle Hank because (as we know) he's not so much a fan of the talking, and Carl because he'd like to get the odd word in edgewise himself.

On the other hand, Ted's presence forces Carl to curb his own tendency toward exhausting blather, and refine his message and delivery to sneak between the cracks in Ted's monologue; and Ted's determined vivacity and corny jokes occasionally get Uncle Hank to almost break a smile, despite his best efforts to maintain maximum grumpiness.

Carl (Mercury) and Uncle Hank (Saturn) are in a square aspect to Ted (Jupiter). They don't like the cut of his jib. They find him irritating. They wish he'd shut up. But they're also benefiting from Ted's presence; he's making them into slightly better versions of themselves.

Planets in square aspect experience friction with each other. They're usually in signs of incompatible element and the same quality (cardinal, fixed, mutable). If you've got two planets opposite each other but both square another planet, you've got yourself a T-square configuration, which I think of as the "an enemy of my enemy is my friend" aspect. Both the opposing planets have a beef with the third planet, so they work together to settle their differences with him.

| Aries               | Cancer, Capricorn              |

| Aquarius            | Taurus, Scorpio                |
| Pisces              | Gemini, Sagittarius            |

# Opposition

Degrees of separation: 180° (six signs)
Orb of influence: 7°
Key concepts: Judgment, conflict, balance, awareness, projection, reaching out

Across the table from cousin Angela is cousin Phoebe (the Moon). Phoebe is Angela's molecular opposite: shy, quiet, and sensitive. The two cousins have little to say to one another; they regard each other from across the table as ambassadors from different countries, in different hemispheres, possibly from different planets.

But they also rather admire one another. Angela (Venus) sometimes feels she could benefit from being a little quieter and nurturing her inner life (the Moon); Phoebe would love to have a makeover and be as glamorous and socially at ease as Angela. It's as though they're missing halves of a two-piece puzzle. The potential for two planets in opposition is that, since they're in signs of complementary element, they can learn from each other how to develop the qualities they envy in one another.

Planets in opposition are coming from different places (opposite houses) and often behave in very different ways (opposite signs). But like Angela and Phoebe, they can't avoid looking at each other because they're seated directly opposite each other. They can envy each other, try to emulate each other, or declare open warfare on each other; one thing they can't do is ignore each other.

| Libra               | Aries                              |
| Scorpio             | Taurus                             |
| Sagittarius         | Gemini                             |

| Aquarius            | Leo                                |
| Pisces              | Virgo                              |

Minor aspects are fascinating, but when you're first learning astrology you can safely disregard them. Focus on major aspects to get the big picture; minor aspects add richness and dimension, like shading on a portrait, but you can still get a clear picture without them.

# Minor (But Not Trivial) Aspects

While the louder, more extravagant aspects grab the spotlight, other, more subtle influences are also at work. Think of the extras in a film; they don't have dialogue that the audience hears, but you see them in the background chatting animatedly with one another. Apparently, however, it's not conversation that drives the story's central drama.

Around your Thanksgiving table (and huddled around the kids' table) are several minor dramas unfolding. You'll have to look closely to notice them, but they contribute significantly to the overall mood of the gathering.

I believe that minor aspects represent blind spots, where you really don't stop to ask yourself what's going on. Major aspects can absolutely not be ignored; they represent crucial, defining characteristics of you and your life. But minor aspects offer answers to questions you don't really think to ask, about matters that are sometimes troubling and irritating but that you accept, sort of like wallpaper.

# Semisextile

Degrees of separation: 30° (one sign)
Recommended orb: 1°
Key concepts: Correction, reaction

Sitting next to Uncle Hank is Aunt Leticia (Uranus). They're the type of couple that prompt head-scratching bewilderment of the "How in the heck did those two end up together?" variety. Aunt Leticia is breezy, affable, and as offbeat in dress and personality as Uncle Hank is conservative and grumbly.

And yet, they've been married for 40 years and seem to get along swimmingly. If it weren't for Aunt Leticia, Uncle Hank probably wouldn't have a friend in the world, but she has dragged so many people home to dinner over the years that some of them have stuck and have become Hank's friends, too. If it weren't for Uncle Hank's steadying influence, Aunt Leticia would probably veer off the rails, careening from endearingly offbeat to flamboyantly eccentric.

Planets in semisextile are in the same degree of adjacent signs. Signs next to each other on the natural wheel share nothing in common—not element, not quality, nothing (except Capricorn and Aquarius, which share Saturn as a ruler). And yet surprisingly often they—like Uncle Hank and Aunt Leticia—benefit from their wildly divergent natures, each curbing and correcting the gravest excesses of the other.

# Semisquare
Degrees of separation: 45° (one-and-a-half signs)

Recommended orb: 1°

Key concepts: Irritation; annoyance; a feeling of "itchiness"

Two planets are semisquare if they're 45 degrees (1½ signs) apart. They're related to squares and oppositions; oppositions divide the horoscope in two, squares divide the horoscope into four, and semisquares divide the horoscope into eight.

The semisquare feels intensely itchy. It's the driving urge (square) to resolve diametrically opposed needs (opposition). In a positive way, we can think of it as an aspect that encourages (okay, demands) integration of the themes represented by these two planets.

At the dining table, Carl and Pete's mom, Regina (the Sun), is simmering at a low boil. She's annoyed by the constant struggles between Pete and his girlfriend, Marge, who keep throwing nasty looks and heated comments at each other. She's about to lock them in the powder room together until they sort things out and can act like grown-ups. (Don't mess with Regina.)

# Quincunx

Degrees of separation: 150° (five signs)
Recommended orb: 5°
Key concepts: Adjustment, imbalance, compromise, dissatisfaction

14 Part 4: Gods and Monsters: Planets

Angela's cousin Ted has a secret: although he's deeply in love with his wife, he's always had a little bit of a crush on her cousin Phoebe. There's something mysterious about her that appeals to Ted, probably because her quiet personality is completely different from his own open, friendly nature.

Like Ted and Phoebe, the quincunx (or inconjunct) aspect separates two planets by 150 degrees (five signs). You find whether a planet is involved in a quincunx fairly easily, as minor aspects go. Just look to the sign opposite the one the planet is in, and find the signs on either side of it; that's where you'll find quincunxes.

> When you're trying to spot aspects in the chart, count signs, not houses. A quincunx, for instance, usually occurs between planets that are five signs away from each other. But since an entire sign is sometimes hidden (intercepted) within a house, quincunx planets are not necessarily five houses away from each other.

The quincunx naturally forms an uneasy alliance between planets in signs with nothing in common (other than Taurus and Libra, signs which are quincunx each other but share a common planetary ruler, Venus). They are from different elements and different modalities, so they have different temperaments and ways of approaching things. And the quincunx is an aspect of inherent inequality; one party is enthralled by—and willing to be the devoted servant of—the other.


These planets/signs just don't get each other. As with Ted and Phoebe, that sense of mystery can be sexually compelling, under the right circumstances, so you often see these signs hooking up. But their very different natures can also wear on the nerves. Constant adjustments and compromises must be made, and it seems only one planet/sign can be happy at a time.

| Gemini              | Scorpio, Capricorn                |
| Cancer              | Sagittarius, Aquarius             |
| Leo                 | Capricorn, Pisces                 |

# Sesquisquare

Degrees of separation: 135° (four-and-a-half signs)

Recommended orb: 1°

Key concepts: Tension, exasperation

Smoldering moodily to Carl's left, his sister Janet (Pluto) is debating whether to murder Pete's girlfriend Marge with a fork or by water torture. Pete had assured his sister that she and Marge would really hit it off and would be great friends; as it turns out, each finds the other extraordinarily irritating—the last straw on an afternoon when both are already having their share of relationship problems.

The sesquisquare, also known as the sesquiquadrate, separates planets by 135 degrees. They naturally occur between planets in signs that are trine or quincunx each other. If the sesquisquare occurs in trine signs, we've got one of these situations where it looks on paper like the planets should get along beautifully … and yet they really want to strangle each other. If they occur in signs that are quincunx, they don’t expect to get along and just give over to their mutual antipathy. What can you expect from an aspect that’s like a semisquare (45 degrees) added to a square (90)? Imagine you’re pushing a massive boulder uphill, all by yourself, while a thousand flies bite at you. The irritating, abrasive quality of this aspect feels like the quivering tension of a wishbone that’s ready to snap. It’s insult to injury, the straw that broke the camel’s back, and dealing with your sister’s annoying girlfriend on a day when you and your mother are already at each other’s throats. For that reason, I think of the sesquiquadrate as the “I don’t need this!” aspect.

## Parallel and Contraparallel

Parallels are a bit different from other aspects because they measure declination, or two planets' distance from the celestial equator, rather than their celestial longitude. Not that you need to know much about that. Suffice to say that if two planets are within a degree of the same declination (their latitude, projected onto the celestial sphere), they're parallel, which has the feel of a conjunction. If they're within a degree of the same declination but one is north of the equator and the other is south, they're contraparallel, which is sort of like an opposition.

Back at the dinner table, I neglected to mention before that Regina is holding the family's 20-pound tabby, Oliver, on her shoulders. It just worked out that way. After Regina finished eating, the cat leaped into her arms, then sidled up onto Regina's shoulders where he is perched in a state of supreme satisfaction. He's awesome to behold, and he knows it. Everyone digs his cute expressions, and when the tension gets too thick, Oliver can be counted upon to do something cute and relieve the pressure.

Meanwhile, hiding under the table at Regina's feet is Rufus, the family dog. Rufus is happy with his place in the family, happy to eat the scraps that fall to the floor, content to be mostly overlooked, stepped on, and hollered at. Until he catches the occasional glimpse of Oliver, on top of the world and the beloved center of attention.
Oliver the tabby cat is parallel to Regina, occupying the same general space but a bit higher up. Rufus is contraparallel to Oliver—in line with Regina but lower down and out of sign.

# Interpreting Planets in Aspect

Getting a handle on planetary aspects can be tricky. The usual rookie mistake is to break off too big a piece of the pie all at once. If you've bitten off, say, the Moon in Leo AND in the sixth house AND trine Jupiter in Sagittarius AND in the tenth house—well, that's a mouthful, and it's no surprise if you choke on it a bit.

So take it slow. Start with the planets; who are the characters you're dealing with? The Moon, your inner June Cleaver, and Jupiter, your inner Indiana Jones. Think about those two for a moment; how would those two get along, if Indy should happen to stop by the Cleaver household, whip in hand and fedora on head? June would be polite, of course. She'd offer to take his hat and whip and to serve him a cool beverage, but she'd probably be a bit annoyed about the mud on his shoes. Indy would politely accept the drink, but would be looking over her shoulder, into Ward's study, where he spots a globe and something that looks like a big dictionary or atlas.

Within you, there is a connection between the desire to be comfortable and to nurture yourself and others, and the desire to explore the larger world of ideas and adventure. What is the nature of the connection? A trine, an easy aspect between planets in signs of the same element. June, noticing Indy's interest, leads him into Ward's study to show him the beautiful atlas she gave her husband as a birthday gift. She asks her visitor to show her the most interesting country he's ever visited. For his part, Indy compliments her on the lemonade, which is a perfect balance of tart and sweet, and comments on the comfort and graciousness of her home. Your Moon—your nesting instinct, and the things that make you comfortable—is at ease with the world of adventure. You like exotic strangers who stop by wearing a fedora. You decorate your home with artifacts from other lands. Depending on the rest of your chart, you might even some day make your home (the Moon) in a land far from your birth (Jupiter).


# Incorporating Signs and Houses with Aspects

That's a lot of information, just from the planetary aspect. What about the signs and houses? Well, the Moon is in Leo, an attention-grabbing sign; your home is a bit of a showpiece, perhaps, because you need to feel proud of where you live. And it's in the sixth house, a house of order and also of work; perhaps you feel most at home when you're at work, or you might work at home. Within you, the concepts of domestic contentment and work are synonymous.

Jupiter is in Sagittarius, the sign it rules, so your need for adventure and your interest in life's great questions is strong indeed. It's in the tenth house, the house of calling, career, and authority; this is an area of your life where you think big. Publishing, writing, traveling, religion—all are of interest to you.

We know by the trine that joins them that these two parts of your life complement one another. Perhaps you travel a lot as part of your career (Jupiter in Sagittarius in the tenth house) and bring home creative (Moon in Leo) yet practical (Moon in the sixth house) items for your home (Moon in Leo), or ideas for your home business (Moon in the sixth house). There are a lot of possible interpretations, of course, but hopefully this example will get your own interpretive juices flowing.

# Essential Takeaways

* Aspects are angular relationships between planets or other important points in the chart.
* The "easy" aspects are the conjunction, sextile, and trine. They symbolize harmony and compatibility.
* The "hard" aspects are the square and opposition. They represent conflict, challenge, and incompatibility. Major aspects represent defining characteristics and major life issues; minor aspects symbolize more subtle dynamics requiring compromise or changes in perspective.

* Interpreting planetary aspects is easier if you take it slowly. It can be helpful to imagine the planets as characters having a dialogue.

* Interpretations of the aspects between planets includes the sign and house placements of the planets.
