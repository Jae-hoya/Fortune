The Moon's waxing phases and beginning new things
The Moon's waning phases and completing things
The Sun's cycle of energy and personal growth
Mercury's cycle of communication and learning
Venus's cycle of enjoyment, relationships, and finances

I grew up in a farm community of grizzled men in muddy coveralls and women in calico housedresses. These people took more of a "nose to the grindstone" than a "head in the clouds" approach to life, yet every household boasted a well-thumbed copy of the Farmer's Almanac, the popular guide to planting by the Moon. No crops were planted, no garden harvested, no animals bred, no haircuts administered to squirmy adolescents unless the phase of the moon was "right." There wasn't any discussion of "living in harmony with the cosmos"; it's simply that experience had shown these practical people that lunar cycles worked.

The phases of the Moon—the 28-day unfolding of the angles between Sun, Moon, and earth—are the easiest of all cycles to identify and work with. Simply look up in the sky: the Moon's appearance will tell you where you are in its cycle. During the waxing phases of the Moon (between New Moon and Full Moon), we plant; and during the waning phases (between Full Moon and New Moon), we gather. There are a few subtle variations along the way, but that's basically it.

Even if you never stick your hands in the ground and only buy your food from a market, you have things to plant—if only the intangible seeds of new ideas and intentions. All enterprises that you hope will grow and flourish are best undertaken during a waxing Moon. Then, during the waning Moon, you can take your ideas and products to the marketplace.

# Starting Things: The Waxing Moon

Between the New and Full Moon phases, the Moon is waxing. Each night its light increases until it reaches maximum illumination at the Full Moon. In fact, a good way to remember the difference between the waxing and waning moons is to think of how waxing your coffee table or your car makes it shine brighter!

## New Moon

Walk outside on the evening of a New Moon, and the sky is dark; the Moon set with the Sun. Getting around requires faith in your gut instinct and the light from a sprinkling of stars. And yet as farmers and gardeners have long known, this is the best time to plant seeds. For planting is always an act of faith; seeds look as small and insignificant as stars, and you can only hope that these tiny pellets will someday look like the picture on the seed packet.

The New Moon is a time to start fresh. Where is the "soil" of your life ready to receive new seeds of inspiration? Find the degree and sign of the New Moon (see the table in Appendix B), and note which house of your birth chart they fall in. This is the house of crucial activity and insights in the month ahead. You can't know now whether the seeds you plant will come to fruition—you can only dream, plant, and have faith.

Finding the New Moon in the sky: The Moon rises and sets with the Sun, so you won't see it at all in its New phase.

Things to do at the New Moon: Initiate new ventures—a new business, job, marriage, or garden. Think about how you would like to improve yourself and your life. Make lists of things to accomplish in the month ahead.

# New Moon Wishes

At the New Moon, the Sun and Moon are together in the same degree of the same sign. The house where this degree and sign falls in your birth chart represents the area of your life that is ready to receive your New Moon wishes:

* First and seventh houses: Wish for personal improvement and better relationships.
* Second and eighth houses: Wish for improved financial conditions.
* Third and ninth houses: Wish for better communication, for travel or for visitors, and for knowledge and insight.
* Fourth and tenth houses: Wish for an improved living situation or career success.
* Fifth and eleventh houses: Wish for creative inspiration, for friendships, and for fun.
* Sixth and twelfth houses: Wish for good health, peace, and enlightenment.

# Waxing Crescent Moon

At the Waxing Crescent phase, the Moon begins to show a sliver of brightness—and likewise, you are beginning to "see the light." You begin to grasp both the opportunities and difficulties of achieving what you set out for yourself at the New Moon.

As the landscape becomes clearer, you may lose heart and resign yourself to the status quo. At the Waxing Crescent Moon, complacency is a sign of failure. If you've ever tried to lose weight, you know the disheartening feeling of beginning a diet with enthusiasm and determination, only to find that both are weakening within a few days. "It will take me forever to lose 20 pounds, and I might not manage to do it at all," you think. "So why don't I just enjoy myself now? Hand me that Twinkie!"

Patience and the power of your own mind are the keys to navigating the Waxing Crescent phase. As Henry Ford once said, "Whether you think you can do something or you think you can't, you're probably right."

Finding the Waxing Crescent in the sky: Look for a tiny lunar sliver in the west in the early evening, after the sun has set.

Things to do at the Waxing Crescent phase: Gather information, supplies, or other resources that you need for a project, event, or other goal.

# First Quarter Moon

At the First Quarter Moon, it's time to take action. At the New Moon, you conceived a vision, and at the Waxing Crescent Moon you considered what it would take to realize that vision. Now it is time to push forward and to make a real commitment.

If you got a bit ahead of yourself at the New Moon and jumped right into something new without preparation, you might find, only a week later, that you need to alter those plans. It's a bit like assembling furniture from a kit without looking at the instructions; it might work out fine, or somewhere along the line you might find that you're on your way to constructing a three-legged chair.

Luckily, at the First Quarter Moon, the furniture glue has not yet hardened. There's still time to make changes, and now is the time to do it. Don't be afraid to change your mind, and by all means add another leg to that chair.

# Finding the First Quarter Moon in the sky
The First Quarter Moon rises in the east at noon and sets in the west at midnight. Half of the Moon's illuminated face is visible.

# Things to do at the First Quarter Moon
Change your mind. Ask for what you want.

# Waxing Gibbous Moon
At the Waxing Gibbous phase, the Moon looks very close to full. Likewise, whatever intentions you planted at the New Moon may look fully formed and ready for harvesting. But looks can be deceiving, and almost is not the same as ready.

Anyone who has ever baked a cake knows what a Gibbous Moon is like. As you peer at that cake through the glass window in the oven door, it looks done. You test it with a skewer, which comes out almost clean … except for that one pesky spot near the center that's still a little gooey. "Maybe I should take it out now," you think. "Surely it will retain some heat and continue cooking long enough to finish that center bit, and after all I don't want to over-bake it and end up with a dry cake."

I'm here to tell you that if you take that cake out of the oven now, you'll end up with a gorgeous looking, mostly perfect cake … with a gooey center. Likewise, if you declare victory for your New Moon intentions at the Gibbous Moon, there is almost certainly something half-baked about them.

# Finding the Waxing Gibbous Moon in the sky
The Waxing Gibbous Moon looks almost full; about three quarters of the Moon's illuminated face is visible. It rises in the east in the mid to late afternoon and can be easily seen before sunset. It sets at about 3 a.m.

# Things to do at the Waxing Gibbous Moon
Wait. Sometimes that is the hardest thing to do, but right now it's what's necessary. Fine-tune. Analyze.

# Finishing Things: The Waning Moon
Between the Full and New Moon phases, the Moon is waning. An astrologer friend and I like to refer to this as the "whining" part of the lunar cycle; it's a time of reaping what one has sewn and reflecting on how you might need to change your approach to ensure a better outcome in the future. Ideally, it's a time of reflection and objective soul-searching—but for each of us, there comes a time when some good old-fashioned whining feels pretty satisfying!

# Full Moon
How did you do? Do the plants in your garden, or the projects in your life, resemble the vision you had for them at the New Moon? The light of the Full Moon reflects both the strengths of your New Moon plans and how you might correct your course to steer away from future missteps and obstacles.

The Full Moon is also a time to reflect on your relationships with other people. So review your New Moon plans—but more importantly, review the state of your heart. Are you falling into difficult patterns with the people you care about? It's not too late to change course. If you find yourself becoming too wrapped up in your own plans to be kind to the people around you, take a step back and look at things from someone else's point of view.

Finding the Full Moon in the sky: It's hard to miss! It rises in the east at sunset and sets in the west at dawn; it shines all night.

# Things to do at the Full Moon:
Take an honest look at where you are. Ask for, and pay attention to, feedback from customers, co-workers, family members, and friends.

# Once in a Blue Moon
A Blue Moon is the second Full Moon in a calendar month, or the third Full Moon in a season (for example, from vernal equinox to summer solstice) with four Full Moons (instead of the usual three). The colloquial expression "once in a Blue Moon" refers to something that doesn't happen often. So how often do we have a Blue Moon? About once every two to three years.

# Waning Gibbous Moon
Why is it so delicious to get together with a group of same-sex friends to compare notes about relationships? Why are the late-night confabs over cocktails the best part of any professional conference? Why did my grandmother and her friends enjoy working together on their quilts, bending over the giant quilting frame in her living room and chatting the hours away?

Because humans are social creatures. We crave interactions with our fellow humans, and we learn from them. If something you initiated at the New Moon—a business, relationship, garden, craft project—didn't turn out the way you'd hoped, you might benefit from the advice of others who've tried the same things, perhaps with better success. And if you succeeded beyond your wildest dreams—well, it might be nice to share some of your tips with others. Astrologers call this the Disseminating Moon, and it's a good time to spread the seeds of knowledge and ideas. This is the time of the month to set up your quilting frame, pour some cocktails, and talk things over with like-minded souls.

# Finding the Waning Gibbous Moon in the sky

It rises midevening and sets midmorning. As with the Waxing Gibbous Moon, the illuminated face of the Moon is about three quarters visible.

# Things to do at the Waning Gibbous Moon

Discuss your progress with others. Teach, give lectures, or conduct training. Write letters and proposals.

# Last Quarter Moon

At the Last Quarter Moon, it's time to take stock of your progress during this cycle. If you've veered too far off course from your New Moon goals, perhaps you can gently correct your trajectory now. It's also possible that you now have a better perspective on what those goals should have been! Begin now to think about the goals you wish to set for the next New Moon cycle, beginning about a week from now.

The Last Quarter phase is a time to develop understanding. It's time to weigh the perceptions and feedback of the Full and Gibbous Moon phases and to decide what is really true and right for you. Acknowledge that there are things you could do differently in your business, your relationships, your creative projects—but also, that there are times to stand firm in the courage of your convictions.

The Last Quarter Moon is a time of increased tension, so be gentle with yourself and with others. Misunderstandings are more likely than usual.

# Finding the Last Quarter Moon in sky

Go to bed early and you'll miss it—the Last Quarter Moon rises after midnight. It doesn't set until around noon, though, so look for it in the morning sky. Half of the Moon's illuminated face can be seen—the half opposite what was visible at the First Quarter Moon.

# Things to do at the Last Quarter Moon

Edit your work. Organize your workplace or home and figure out what you can let go. If you need to end a difficult relationship once and for all, now is a good time to do it.

# Waning Crescent Moon

Before planting a new crop of seeds, it's necessary to let the soil rest. And as you reach the end of this month's 28-day lunar cycle, you could probably benefit from some rest yourself. So plan some down time for this part of the monthly cycle. Don't fill your days with activity. Take some time to think about, and let go of, the things, people, and situations that no longer provide help or happiness. Let your soil rest, so you can receive the next New Moon's seeds of energy and intention.

Finding the Waning Crescent Moon in the sky: It rises a few hours before the Sun and sets a few hours after noon. Look for a tiny lunar sliver in the eastern early morning sky.

Things to do at the Waning Crescent Moon: Discard unwanted or unneeded things. Catch up on your rest. Tie up loose ends, such as billing for work already completed. Meditate. Record your dreams, as they're often numerous and rich during this phase.

# The Sun: Cycles of Personal Growth

The Sun moves through the entire zodiac in about one year, spending about 30 days in each sign. The date that the Sun enters each sign can vary by a day from year to year; this is because the Sun's cycle doesn't match up exactly with our 365-day calendar year. The Sun's cycle through the houses of your birth chart shows where you are feeling most alive, and where you are ready to blossom, grow, and celebrate your own unique fabulousness.

Practically speaking, we can't live without the Sun
And in astrology, the Sun is likewise considered the animating force of the birth chart, describing your unique genius, magnetism, and sense of personal identity. As the Sun moves through the houses of your chart, it indicates where you are especially compelling and attractive and where you are most likely to attract attention and receive the recognition you deserve. If not all of that recognition is positive, it's a signal that perhaps you haven't been living up to your potential in that area of your life.

The Sun also symbolizes creative impulses and ability. You needn't write a song or paint a picture to be "creative"—creativity is simply the merging of skills with passion. A mechanic who can apply his passionate for understanding how things work to diagnosing what's wrong with a wheezing engine is every bit as creative as an actor giving an Academy Award-winning performance. Where is your creative heart this month, and where can you best share your creative gifts with others?

# Moving Through the Signs

As the Sun moves through your chart, it's important to make time for fun and recreation. It's no coincidence that Sunday, the traditional day of rest, is named after the Sun! "A change is as good as a rest," as an old expression suggests. The Sun's sign indicates the activities that will make you feel happy and alive this month, and that will give you the opportunity to grow. To make sure people listen to you, adapt your style or mode of communication to the Sun's current sign placement:

* Sun in Aries: Starting new things.
* Sun in Taurus: Relaxation and enjoyment of the finer things in life.
* Sun in Gemini: Short trips, conversation, changes in routine, reading and writing.
* Sun in Cancer: Time spent with family, thinking about the past.
* Sun in Leo: Vacation, recreation, creative pursuits.
* Sun in Virgo: Cleaning, organizing, editing.
* Sun in Libra: Collaborating, negotiating, enjoying the arts.
* Sun in Scorpio: Introspection and spending time with intimate loved ones.
* Sun in Sagittarius: Long trips, religious or ritual observances, celebrations.
* Sun in Capricorn: Making resolutions for the year ahead, getting serious about your goals.
* Sun in Aquarius: Making important changes, spending time with friends.
* Sun in Pisces: Rest and reflection, enjoying the arts, anything that lets you escape from the everyday world.

# Astro Tip

Most likely, the houses of your chart are not all the same size. Some houses are skinny, others wide; the Sun, Moon, and planets will take much longer to move through some others than others. If one is inclined to think in terms of past lives, we can safely assume the larger houses of your chart represent areas where you neglected your homework in previous incarnations and now must turn in some extra-credit assignments. (See Part 3 for details on how the birth chart is divided into houses.)

# Moving Through the Houses

The Sun moving through the houses of your chart symbolizes settings and situations where you would benefit from cultural activities, entertainment, or fun getaways:

* The Sun in your first house: This is one of the best months all year to assert yourself. Go ahead; be a little pushy!
* The Sun in your second house: Celebrate life, nature, and your many blessings. Get better at relaxing and enjoying yourself.

* **The Sun in your third house:** Enjoy time with siblings and neighbors. Celebrate your creativity in writing or storytelling, and spread the world about yourself and your efforts.

* **The Sun in your fourth house:** Celebrate your roots, and the family that made you who you are. Focus on becoming the ancestor that future generations of your family will be proud to claim as their own.

* **The Sun in your fifth house:** This is one of the most creative months of the year for you. Put your whole self into your creative passions, and inspire others to explore their own creativity.

* **The Sun in your sixth house:** This is your month to shine in your workplace. You should also honestly evaluate areas for improvement, but resist the urge to become too critical of yourself or others.

* **The Sun in your seventh house:** Suddenly everyone wants to be your best friend! This is a good month to share the spotlight with others, so look for opportunities to collaborate with others on creative projects.

* **The Sun in your eighth house:** For many people, this is a low point in the year, with much self-examination, a little regret, and difficult feelings about other people that need to be resolved. Give yourself over completely to the feelings that arise, then let them go! It's the psychological equivalent of taking out the garbage.

* **The Sun in your ninth house:** This is a wonderful month for an adventure. If you've been wanting to take a big chance on something new, this is the month to do it! Also a good month to travel (especially overseas) and to share your knowledge with others.

* **The Sun in your tenth house:** If you've been needing to make a career push, do it during the month when the Sun is moving through your tenth house. Others will instinctively look up to you this month, so be sure you present yourself in a way that earns their respect.

* **The Sun in your eleventh house:** This is a great month to get your message out to a mass audience, because you will naturally shine in large groups of people.

* The Sun in your twelfth house : One of the lowest months of the year for physical vitality. Get lots of rest so you’ll be ready to hit the ground running next month .

# Mercury: Cycles of Learning

When I was growing up during the Jurassic era (before cable and DVR), late-night television was dominated by commercials for the Evelyn Wood speed-reading course. I was too young to appreciate the irony of using television to promote reading (since TV seemed destined to replace books altogether), but as an enthusiastic reader I thought speed reading sounded like the coolest thing ever. Think how many more books I could consume!

If planets could buy commercial advertising spots, Mercury would have cornered the market on behalf of Ms. Wood. Mercury moves through the zodiac in approximately 88 days, spending about three weeks in each sign (unless retrograde). Mercury is zippy—fitting for the planet of new information, variety, and (if deprived of these things) boredom. Mercury is not the kind of planet who would have stood for being in the same sign for very long; as it is, it turns pretty cranky when it's retrograde and forced to spend twice as long in a single sign!

Mercury never travels farther than 28 degrees from the Sun, so it is always in the same sign as the Sun, or the sign before or after. If the Sun is the rock star of the zodiac, Mercury is his press agent—the one who spreads the word far and wide and soothes his client with flattering words about his talent and virility. While Mercury moves around your chart, let it spread the word about your talents, knowledge, and charm.

# Moving Through the Signs

To make sure people listen to you, adapt your style or mode of communication to Mercury's current sign placement:

* Mercury in Aries: Fast, impulsive, direct
* Mercury in Taurus: Slow, deliberate, unpretentious

* The Sun in your twelfth house: One of the lowest months of the year for physical vitality. Get lots of rest so you'll be ready to hit the ground running next month.
* Mercury in Gemini: Quick, frequent change of topic
* Mercury in Cancer: Intuitive, guarded, sentimental
* Mercury in Leo: Dramatic, playful, creative
* Mercury in Virgo: Detail-oriented, critical, practical
* Mercury in Libra: Tactful, diplomatic
* Mercury in Scorpio: Silent but deadly
* Mercury in Sagittarius: Loud, theatrical, opinionated
* Mercury in Capricorn: Taciturn, authoritative
* Mercury in Aquarius: Quirky, rebellious, opinionated
* Mercury in Pisces: Gentle, humorous, artistic

Like an adolescent on summer vacation, Mercury tends to get into mischief when it gets bored. So give it the job of documenting your life's story. Personal journals, once all the rage, have fallen a bit out of fashion in the era of Facebook and Twitter. But while social networking is ideal for sharing updates about what you had for lunch, there is great value in recording your more private thoughts for posterity. Buy a great-looking notebook and a terrific pen and set aside a few minutes each evening to set down a few remembrances. Mercury—and your future self!—will thank you for it.

# Moving Through the Houses

As Mercury flits from one house of your chart to the next, it symbolizes where you are ready for more knowledge and information. In which area of your life is it time for you to learn something new, get a new perspective, or acquire a new skill?

* Mercury in your first house: Talk about yourself! This is also a great month to confront people or situations that have been bothering you.
* Mercury in your second house: Give your finances a thorough going-over this month, and if necessary, get advice about how to handle your money and resources better.
* Mercury in your third house: Your best month all year for writing, reading, speaking, and taking short trips in a fast car.
* Mercury in your fourth house: Explore your family genealogy. Visit or call your family. Begin writing your memoir.
* Mercury in your fifth house: Promote your latest creative project. Take a class to learn a new creative skill, such as playing an instrument, painting, or writing a screenplay.
* Mercury in your sixth house: Make a list of everything in your life that needs repair. Set up a filing system or archive. Sort through those dusty boxes in the garage.
* Mercury in your seventh house: Pass the talking stick to your partner or closest friends. Handle communications that require diplomacy and negotiation.
* Mercury in your eighth house: Get some perspective on what makes you tick—talk to a therapist, psychic, or astrologer. This is also an excellent time for research and sleuthing.
* Mercury in your ninth house: Limit your intake of gossip, small talk, and television. This is the time to sift through all the thoughts, information, and ideas you've gathered and share them with others—through writing, teaching, or public speaking.
* Mercury in your tenth house: Show off your brain. Learn a new career-related skill. Take a communication-related career to the next level.
* Mercury in your eleventh house: Now is a good time for visits and chats with friends, and to indulge yourself in social networking. You are likely to receive unexpected flashes of inspiration.
* Mercury in your twelfth house: As much as possible, give your mind a vacation this month. Feed it lots of novels and reality TV, listen to music, and take naps.

# Venus: Cycles of Enjoyment

Ask any astrologer what his or her clients talk about most, and the answer will almost certainly be relationships and money. In other words, if you learn nothing else about astrology besides how to understand the cycles of Venus—the astrological symbol for money and relationships—you'll probably consider your education more than sufficient.

Venus symbolizes pure enjoyment—of other people, and of all the delights earth has to offer. But although it's a symbol of finding love and money, it also describes how we bring beauty, harmony, and gifts to the lives of those around us.

In its roughly 225-day orbit around the Sun, Venus moves through each sign of the zodiac and each house of your birth chart. Venus's current sign introduces you, usually monthly (except when Venus is retrograde), to a different style of relating and enjoyment. And Venus's cycle through the houses of your birth chart point to where romantic attraction and financial opportunities are likely to be found at any given time.

# Moving Through the Signs

As Venus moves through the signs of the zodiac, there is a strong pull to handle relationships and financial matters in the style of that sign:

* Venus in Aries: Love at first sight; impulse spending
* Venus in Taurus: Sensuality; indulgence, spending on quality
* Venus in Gemini: Flirtation; comparison shopping
* Venus in Cancer: Courting; saving
* Venus in Leo: Whirlwind romance; lavish spending
* Venus in Virgo: Office romance; bargain hunting
* Venus in Libra: Serious relationships; spending on appearance
* Venus in Scorpio: Passionate intimacy; compulsive spending
* Venus in Sagittarius: Free love; generosity and philanthropy
* Venus in Capricorn: Committed relationship; investment
* Venus in Aquarius: Strange bedfellows; unexpected money
* Venus in Pisces: Unconditional love; charity

Venus symbolizes all that is beautiful, graceful, and delicious in life. But as we know, too much of a good thing can be hazardous to your health (and your bank account). As Venus moves through the houses of your chart, aim for a happy balance between indulgence and extravagance. Honor Venus with fresh flowers and a nice bottle of wine for dinner, but no one needs a six-course dinner at a five-star restaurant every night.

# Moving Through the Houses

As Venus moves through the houses of your birth chart, it reveals opportunities to beautify your world, build better relationships with others, and find financial opportunities and insights:

* Venus moving through your first house: Beautify your appearance, and be cautious about moving into new relationships too quickly. Be assertive in asking for what you want, but avoid impulsive spending and borrowing or lending from friends and family.
* Venus in your second house: Spruce up your property and have your possessions appraised. You're drawn to relationships with people who are comfortable, reliable, and prosperous.
* Venus in your third house: You instinctively express yourself in a charming way this month, so it's a good time to ask for a raise or a favor. Communication, writing, and transportation are good sources of financial opportunity or insight. The way others speak or write can make them very attractive to you this month.

* **Venus moving through your fourth house:** It's a very good month to decorate your home. Real estate and domestically oriented businesses and activities are where the money is. You're most attracted to people who feel familiar, "like family."

* **Venus moving through your fifth house:** If you've ever wanted to make money from your art, this is a good month for it. It's also a splendid month for entertaining. Outgoing, generous, and confident people will be most appealing to you this month.

* **Venus moving through your sixth house:** Beautify your workplace; paint, or bring a plant or water fountain to your office. You're likely to get a raise or find a romantic interest at work. It's also a very good month to untangle your finances and get caught up on bookkeeping.

* **Venus moving through your seventh house:** Show your partners and close friends your honest affection and regard, and offer your enemies a little mercy. Your best financial opportunities this month come from networking.

* **Venus moving through your eighth house:** You may find yourself bringing brightness and grace to those in dark and difficult circumstances, and may be drawn to relationships with moody, troubled people. Your finances may become entangled with other people's, and it's a good time for choosing investments.

* **Venus moving through your ninth house:** You're rewarded this month for being daring and innovative, and are likely to find financial opportunity through travel, foreign countries, education, or publishing. This month you might find yourself attracted to people who are from quite a different background than yourself.

* **Venus moving through your tenth house:** People in positions of authority instinctively like you this month, so it's another good time to ask for a raise or promotion. (If you're self-employed, raise your rates!) If you're looking for romance, you'll likely find it with someone who is in the same profession you are, or who is a bit younger or older than you are.

* Venus moving through your eleventh house: If you've been wondering if a particular friendship might turn into something romantic, you will probably get your answer this month. Financial opportunities or insights are likely through networking, and if you were promised a raise last month, this is when you should begin to see additional income from your work.

* Venus moving through your twelfth house: You'll love spending time alone this month, or holed up at home with just your partner. Your best financial opportunities come through spiritual, metaphysical, artistic, or philanthropic sources such as church contacts, nonprofit groups, art and music, or metaphysical activities (tarot card readings, astrology, etc.).
