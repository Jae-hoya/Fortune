# Your Inner Gladiator: Mars

The planet Mars, traditionally known as the "lesser malefic" (translation: a bad guy, but not as awful as Saturn, the greater malefic), is a sort of symbolic shorthand for a handful of qualities and impulses that essentially boil down to "survival instinct." Mars's astrological trademarks—anger, aggression, violence, competition, bravery—are side effects of the primal, biological urge to live.

No matter how sweet, kind, and peace loving a person you think you are, Mars is somewhere in your birth chart and your psyche. If you doubt it, think about how angry you get when someone cuts you off in traffic, or how you'd struggle if you were attacked. And remember, too, how you came to exist in the first place. Out of the all the spermatozoa making a play for Mom's egg, yours was the winner. Yours got there first, and you won a coveted ticket to life on earth.

You want to live. You intend to survive.
If you and a mob of other starving people were thrown a loaf of bread, Mars would propel you into the mosh pit to grab for a slice. The urge to help the human race survive is also a Mars function hard-wired into your psyche; Mars is named for the god of war, and symbolizes the willingness to take up arms. And if you and a member of the opposite sex were the only two people left on earth, Mars would turn down the sheets and urge you to get busy perpetuating the species.

Mars rules the sign of Aries, and along with Pluto is the co-ruler of Scorpio. Mars is exalted, or especially strong, in the sign of Capricorn, which provides discipline, focus, and structure to Mars' raw energy. Mars' themes of individualism and open aggression are a difficult fit for the polite, partnership-oriented sign of Libra (detriment); and Cancer (fall), which values collectivism and prefers an indirect approach to settling disagreements.

# The God: The Hunter
The great astrologer and author Steven Forrest describes Mars as offering us two choices: to be the hunter, or the prey. I'll take the liberty of expanding on that a bit to say that, at its best, Mars is also our fierce guardian and protector.

After an evening with friends at a new club, you find yourself walking down a dark street, alone, in a bad part of town. Every nerve and sinew vibrate with attention; your intuition, like antennae, restlessly scans the perimeter for potential threats. Suddenly, from the shadows, a loud noise, a blur of motion. You take off running down the street, adrenaline propelling you faster than you've run since childhood ....

In your second year working at a company that hired you for an entry-level job, an opening becomes available for a position several pay grades higher than your current one. You have most of the qualifications and a gut instinct that you'd be absolutely brilliant at the job. But could you possibly succeed? Are you being too aggressive, reaching so high, so soon in your career?

There's no reason to believe you'll succeed. Yet you apply for the job, dazzle the interviewers, and get the promotion ....

Mars is the instinct that gets us out of danger, but he doesn't just play defense. He also encourages us to take risks and pursue opportunities. When someone tells you to be careful, or that you can't do something, or that no one in your position has ever been promoted so quickly, Mars responds with a sassy, "Oh, yeah? Watch me."

## Meet the Malefics

In traditional astrology, Mars was known as the lesser malefic planet and Saturn as the greater malefic. Symbolizing violence, war, and conflict (Mars) as well as hardship and limitations (Saturn), these planets were thought to represent everything that was bad (malefic) about being alive. Modern astrologers take a less dire view of both planets and mostly use the terms “greater malefic” and “lesser malefic” when we wish to sound mysterious.

# The Monster: Predator or Prey

Mars in his monster guise tends to take two distinct forms: predator or prey. The predator is aggressive, bullying, and domineering; the prey is too afraid to stand up for himself. Both represent a failure to live up to Mars' highest potential of leadership and courage.

Look at any playground, any workplace, and you'll find your share of both Mars "monsters." In school, the "predators" were the bullies who shoved other kids (their prey) off the teeter totter and heckled them in physical education class. When you grew up and entered the workforce, you found the players and tactics had changed, but the game remained the same. Workplace "predators" take credit for other people's work, abuse their employees, or steal another company's intellectual property, all in the name of getting ahead.

There's nothing wrong with going after what you want, and Mars will help you do it. But when Mars gets out of control, he becomes a bully; and when we will not live our lives with courage and assertiveness that Mars demands of us, we become his victim.

# Mars in Signs and Houses

Mars in houses pinpoints the areas of life in which you are assertive and courageous. Because the signs and their natural houses share similar themes, I'm blending 24 paragraphs into 12.

Be sure to read both paragraphs that pertain to Mars' sign and house placement in your birth chart. And remember that aspects between Mars and other planets can also influence the qualities of your inner gladiator.

# Mars in Aries/first house

The hunter: A master of self-promotion, you radiate charisma, physicality, and courage. You're a natural leader and relish competition. The predator: Uncontrolled temper or libido, physical aggression, domineering, recklessness. The prey: Cowardice; refusing to pursue what you want.

The hunter: Passionate about protecting the people you care about, competitive on behalf of your family (soccer mom) and close friends.

# Mars in Pisces/twelfth house

The hunter: Flexible, imaginative, and gentle, you can "whisper" other people into cooperating with you. The predator: "Bewitching" others into doing things for you. Taking advantage of others' kindness. The prey: You're so kindly and agreeable that others take advantage of you mercilessly.

# Your Inner Adventurer: Jupiter

Jupiter has lots of meanings, but they can be summed up in a single word: adventure. Adventures of the mind (education), adventures of the spirit (religion), and physical adventures (travel) are all the province of Jupiter. It's the planet that lifts us out of our everyday experience and tries to make a very large world make sense, and seem familiar.

Growing up on a farm in the Midwest, I spent hours lying on my back in a wheat field, looking up at the sky. Its sheer size excited my imagination; who knew what lay outside my world of flat, yellow light and buzzing insects? The first time I traveled across country by car, I got my taste of a larger world beyond Indiana. Passing through towns with exotic names like Tucumcari and Amarillo, trying to pronounce the Spanish street names in Los Angeles, learning to eat Mexican food—all were thrilling adventures.

When I took my airplane ride and glimpsed the other side of those clouds I'd long admired, I was awestruck. And the first time I touched down in a foreign country, I was astonished to find how ordinary it seemed ... skies, land, trees. From my tiny farm, the world had seemed dauntingly huge and foreign. But by the time I stood on the ground of Sydney, Australia, at the age of 27, the world didn't seem so big after all. Being there felt like an adventure—but it also felt quite a lot like coming home.

Jupiter rules the sign of Sagittarius and co-rules Pisces. Before the discovery of Neptune, Jupiter was the ruler of Pisces and is sometimes called its "traditional ruler." Jupiter is exalted, or especially strong, in the sign of Cancer; that sign's domestic, family-oriented symbolism provides much-needed roots and emotional ballast for Jupiter. Jupiter's themes of optimism, exploration, and big-picture thinking are not an easy fit for Gemini (detriment), a sign that is too rational to be optimistic and prefers to observe and describe the present rather than envision the future; or for serious, conservative, pragmatic Capricorn (sign of its fall).

# Jupiter Fast Facts

* Key concepts—Expansion, optimism, benevolence, higher mind
* Cycle—Takes 12 years to complete a cycle of the zodiac
* Rules—Sagittarius, Pisces (traditional ruler)
* Exalted—Cancer
* Detriment—Gemini
* Fall—Capricorn
* Glyph—First letter of the Greek spelling of Zeus (the Roman Jupiter's Greek counterpart)
* Anatomy—Liver, thighs, hips, blood circulation, pancreas, right ear

# The God: Thinking Big

Let's say you've got this friend, Joe, who's had a passport since he was 6 months old; he thinks nothing of hopping on a plane to vacation in a third-world country. Joe's got an advanced degree, is fluent in several languages, and can talk to just about anyone on a wide variety of topics. He was raised in a family in which education and travel were the norm, and consequently he's at ease in just about any situation, instinctively knowing how to dress, how to behave, and what to order from the menu. He knows what's going on in the world, including recent political developments in countries you've never heard of.

Joe was born and (more or less) raised in the same country you were, but he seems a little bit different. His shoes, which he bought on a trip to Europe, are not like the shoes that are sold here. He doesn't have the same rabid, knee-jerk response to social or political issues that inflame your other friends, because he doesn't have quite the same investment in them that you do. For while Joe is a citizen of the same country that you are, he's more than that. He's a citizen of the world. He's a living, breathing embodiment of everything Jupiter represents in astrology: the willingness to immerse himself in everything life and the world have to offer, the enlarged perspective of the seasoned traveler, and the trained mind of the academic.

# The Monster: Thinking Small

Now let's say you've got another friend, named Bob. Bob has lived in the same small town since the day he was born there, 35 years ago. He's never left the country; in fact, he's never been on an airplane. He barely graduated from high school. He speaks only English, and without much skill or grace. You call to ask him out to lunch, but Bob sneers when you ask if there's a good sushi restaurant in town. "What, hamburger isn't good enough for you?"

Over burgers, you mention your upcoming trip to Africa; you're very excited about it. "Why would you want to go there?" he scoffs. You mention that you're volunteering for a nonprofit group to develop a water system for a small Nigerian village. No sooner does the phrase "nonprofit" leave your lips than Bob rolls his eyes and launches into a 20-minute screed about "do-gooders," and allows as how you couldn't pay him enough to go to a place like that, "not," he notes, "that you'll be getting paid."

Instead of making the large world more familiar to him, Bob's response to Jupiter's call was to make his own small part of the world even smaller. So small, in fact, that he can confidently claim to know everything about it.

# Big Planet on Campus

Jupiter comes by his astrological reputation for "bigness" honestly. In Roman mythology, Jupiter was considered the most powerful of all the gods, and the planet named for him is far and away the largest planet in our solar system, with two-and-a-half times the mass of all the other planets combined! In your chart, Jupiter exaggerates the symbolism of the sign and house in which he's placed.

# Jupiter in Signs and Houses

Jupiter's sign describes the outward style of your inner adventurer. Jupiter in houses pinpoints the areas of life in which you explore beliefs, knowledge, and new experiences. For the sake of space, I'm blending 24 paragraphs into 12, since the signs and their natural houses share similar themes.

Be sure to read both paragraphs that pertain to Jupiter's sign and house placement in your birth chart. And remember that aspects between Jupiter and other planets can also influence the qualities of your inner adventurer.

**Jupiter in Aries/first house** - Thinking big: The sky is the limit; new experiences, foreign lands, and new ways of thinking fill you with joy. Thinking small: Timid and unadventurous; angered or threatened by foreign or unfamiliar people, places, or concepts.

**Jupiter in Taurus/second house** - Thinking big: You believe in being wise with your resources, but you also feel that money, good health, security, and comfort are to be shared and enjoyed. Thinking small: Being content with too little, selling yourself short, overindulging in food, drink, or stimulants; an "easy come, easy go" attitude.

**Jupiter in Gemini/third house** - Thinking big: The ability to transform information, data, and symbols into larger meaning. Thinking small: Being too attached to your native language, your beliefs, and your knowledge to entertain different ones.

**Jupiter in Cancer/fourth house** -Thinking big: Being at home anywhere in the world. Thinking small: Staying in your comfort zone, spending too much time with people and situations that are familiar.

# Jupiter in different houses

**Jupiter in Leo/fifth house** —Thinking big: Writing a life's story that is so creative and magnificent, others are inspired to follow your example. Thinking small: Settling for being a big fish in a small pond.

**Jupiter in Virgo/sixth house** —Thinking big: Making a practical contribution to an important cause, one that makes a real difference in determining whether people live well or die miserably. Thinking small: Hypochondria, sweating the small stuff, and dwelling on the reasons why something can't be done.

**Jupiter in Libra/seventh house** —Thinking big: Forging relationships with equal partners whose joy and vision broaden your own experience of the world. Thinking small: Living vicariously through others.

**Jupiter in Scorpio/eighth house** —Thinking big: Walking fearlessly into other people's secrets, mysteries, and fears; seeking to understand what's really going on beneath the surface. Thinking small: Using your gift for insight to play head games and manipulate people.

**Jupiter in Sagittarius/ninth house** —Thinking big: Taking big chances and seeing out experiences that help you understand the whole world, not just a tiny part of it. Thinking small: Thinking you understand the whole world just because you understand a tiny part of it.

**Jupiter in Aquarius/eleventh house** —Thinking big: Inspiring others to feel that they're part of something important, and that together you can create a legacy that will influence future generations. Thinking small: Being an outsider on the fringes of society, with no influence beyond a small niche.

# Jupiter in Pisces/twelfth house

Thinking big: Becoming significantly involved in alleviating the suffering, pain, and unhappiness in the world. Thinking small: Getting stoned and watching TV.

# Your Inner Teacher: Saturn

Before the discovery of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, Saturn was the furthest known planet from the Sun, marking the outer limits of our solar system. Perhaps this is how it came to be known as the planet of limitations, restrictions, and rules.

Saturn is known as the "greater malefic"—the baddest of planetary bad guys, the Darth Vader of the solar system. Over the years, I've heard many people complain about Saturn in their charts, about the terrible misery and deprivation it has wrought. And I'm reminded, every time, of outspoken U.S. President Harry Truman who, in response to those who told him "Give 'em hell, Harry!" replied, "I never gave anybody hell. I just told the truth and they think it's hell."

All of us have limitations and failings. Our actions have consequences. And we all face tests. Saturn is the symbol that says, "Life is hard. But you can't even begin to make it better unless you first face up to reality and take responsibility."

Saturn rules the sign of Capricorn. It's exalted, or especially strong, in the sign of Libra, which offers a keen appreciation for how our decisions and ambitions affect others. Saturn's themes of patiently overcoming hardship, living by the rules, and pursuing worldly ambition are at odds with the nurturing, security-loving, domestic world of Cancer (the sign of its detriment), and with the impatience and independence of Aries (the sign of its fall).

# Saturn Fast Facts

* Key concepts—Discipline, responsibility, security, wisdom, aging, ambition, limitations
* Cycle—Takes 28 to 30 years to complete a cycle of the zodiac
* Rules—Capricorn, Aquarius (traditional ruler)
* Exalted—Libra
* Detriment—Cancer
* Fall—Aries
* Glyph—Sickle of Chronos, the god of time
* Anatomy—Skin, skeletal system, teeth, ligaments, knees, gall bladder

# The God: The Mentor

I once had a boss who was tough as nails, provoked me to tears on several occasions, and made me spend every Sunday dreading Monday. She was a merciless taskmaster who taught me it's never acceptable to shift the blame for failure—even when the failure wasn't my fault. She was the best boss I ever had.

She taught me about responsibility, one of Saturn's favorite words. Somehow our modern minds confuse the word responsibility with the concept of blame; we feel that taking responsibility in a situation means accepting the blame for what has happened. But the two are not related. Blame means you caused the problem. But responsibility means, simply, that you are able to respond to a situation. There is something you can do to affect the circumstances or outcome.

Saturn is the planet that symbolizes taking that responsibility and running with it. Like the toughest but best mentor, Saturn's the god who refuses to let you complain about your circumstances, pass the buck, depend on others to help you out of a jam, or ever give up. It's the planet of problems, and hardship, yes; but more importantly, it's the planet of proving to yourself and the world that you can overcome those problems and hardships. That you, and you alone, are the author of your fate. 

# The Monster: The Oppressor

It's Christmas Eve, and George Bailey is standing at the edge of a bridge, debating whether to throw himself into the icy river below. George's nemesis, the cold and ruthless Mr. Potter, has stolen $8,000 that was meant to be deposited in George's business account. And now, after a lifetime spent helping others at the expense of pursuing his own ambitions, George is on the verge of bankruptcy and scandal.

In the movie *It's a Wonderful Life*, Mr. Potter is clearly playing the role of "monster" Saturn: "the greater malefic," a cruel, ruthless, oppressive jerk. But while it might seem that we're kicking poor George while he's down in saying so, he's also playing out "monster" Saturn: giving in to despair, depression, and failure. Giving up.

The only way to fight the Saturn monster is to keep plugging away, moving forward when you think you can't take another step, and doing it without excuses or self-pity. Although the sulking voice within complains about how everyone else has it so much easier than you do, such complaints don't become you. And they'll never lead you to the role of leadership and authority that is your birthright.

**Astro Alert**

It's fashionable among people who know something about astrology to complain about Saturn. Saturn is picking on them, Saturn is keeping them from having what they want, and why can't they have Saturn surgically removed from their birth chart? But complaining about Saturn is like complaining about a tough teacher who demands your best work—yes, doing your best is hard, but you always feel better about yourself when you're left everything you have on the playing field.

# Saturn in Signs and Houses

Saturn's sign describes the outward style of your inner taskmaster. Saturn in houses pinpoints the areas of life where you find obstacles that must be overcome. For the sake of space, I'm blending 24 paragraphs into 12, since the signs and their natural houses share similar themes.

_Astro Tip_
Be sure to read both paragraphs that pertain to Saturn's sign and house placement in your birth chart. And remember that aspects between Saturn and other planets can also influence the qualities of your inner teacher.

## Saturn in Aries/first house

## Saturn in Taurus/second house

The mentor: Teaches you to take care of your body and possessions, and to grow prosperous, healthy, and secure. The oppressor: Encourages your insecurity, low self-esteem, fear of poverty, and poor physical condition.

## Saturn in Gemini/third house

**Saturn in Virgo/sixth house** —The mentor: Encourages you to develop practical skills, find meaningful work, and organize your daily affairs; to be of practical service in solving the world's problems. The oppressor: Tells you that you're incompetent, not very bright, and useless.

**Saturn in Libra/seventh house** —The mentor: Encourages you to maintain a balanced lifestyle and to achieve harmonious relationships that balance both individuals' needs. The oppressor: Tells you that life isn't fair and that you'll always be alone.

**Saturn in Capricorn/tenth house** —The mentor: Encourages you to pursue your ambitions and accept the risk of not reaching them; to take responsibility for your life and decisions; and to become a mentor yourself. The oppressor: Tells you you're doomed to be a failure and that no one likes or respects you.

# Saturn in Aquarius/eleventh house

The mentor: Encourages you to be yourself while being part of a community; to act as a focal point for friends and like-minded people, and to lead them in collective action. The oppressor: Tells you that you'll never fit in, that you're hopelessly weird, and that you might actually be a little crazy.

# Saturn in Pisces/twelfth house

The mentor: Encourages you to have faith, to accept impermanence and not knowing what the future brings, and to have compassion for yourself and others. The oppressor: Tells you that faith is no substitute for knowledge, that uncertainty is frightening, and that people are, inherently, no good.

# Essential Takeaways

* Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn symbolize the way you interact with society.
* Mars symbolizes how you handle aggression, competition, and anger.
* Jupiter symbolizes the way you make sense of the world.
* Saturn symbolizes how you deal with limitations and rules and achieve your goals.

# Neptune in your twelfth house

We are one: Receptive to psychic or subliminal influences and the power of suggestion. Powerful dreams. Naturally artistic and musical; able to give voice to collective emotions, images, thoughts, and fears. Good at reading symbols and signs. Not my problem: Losing yourself in your own daydreams, musings, and fears. Using victimhood as an excuse not to move forward with your life. Phobias and obsessions.

# Your Inner Phoenix: Pluto

Life offers us plenty of things to fear. We fear our own deaths, and the deaths of our loved ones. We fear illness, losing our jobs, or finding out our spouses have been unfaithful.

But there's something else that we fear even more, I think, and that's the fear of feeling small and helpless. We fear the kind of freakish Twilight Zone scenario of waking up one day to find that nobody cares about us as individuals—a prisoner in an internment camp, a poor child starving to death in Kenya, or a poor person clinging to the roof of a house in New Orleans.

We fear powerlessness, and we fear being treated inhumanely by those who have power over us. But when we're faced with life's most terrifying and threatening situations, we can surprise ourselves by transcending the fear and emerging stronger than ever, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. In astrology, the fear and the transcendence of that fear share the same symbol: Pluto.

Pluto is symbolically connected to Scorpio, the powerful sign of transformation. The signs of Pluto's exaltation and fall have not been determined; it's in its detriment in Taurus, a sign whose need for stability and security place it fundamentally at odds with Pluto's message of transformation.
