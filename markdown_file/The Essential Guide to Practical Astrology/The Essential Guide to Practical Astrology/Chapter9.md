## Celestial Navigation: Angular Houses

The angular houses: first, fourth, seventh, and tenth

Each angular house is associated with one of the cardinal signs

The first house: self, personality, and physical body

The fourth house: home, family, and roots

The seventh house: partners, close friends, and open enemies

The tenth house: career, authority, and reputation

Opinions vary about what happens to us before birth and after shucking off the mortal coil. But one way to think of it is that when you're born, your spirit gets attached to the corporeal world, like a butterfly pinned up in an etymology exhibit. The angular houses of the chart, representing observable points in space, symbolize the primary experiences that "pin" you to a particular place and set of circumstances.

Your physical body (first house), family and nation (fourth house), vital primary relationships (seventh house), and career or calling (tenth house) are the orienting points on your personal compass. When things change in these areas of your life—even when you initiate the change, as is often the case in these cardinal-energy houses—the entire compass of your life shifts. Such are the consequences of being human: you're no longer free to go where you wish on a whim, and walking into walls is going to get you a big lump on your head. On the plus side, you get to wiggle your toes, enjoy a good meal, and hug your loved ones.

The cusps of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth houses are considered especially powerful and sensitive points. Also referred to as the "angles" of the chart, these cusps, unlike the cusps of the other houses, have special names. Defined in your birth chart by the time and location of your birth,they are the compass points that help you figure out where you are and to navigate the waters ahead.

# First House: The House of Self

Imagine for a moment what it must have felt like to be a newborn baby. You've left the soothing comfort and security of your mother's womb in a bloody, terrifying process, ultimately landing in a bright, cold, scary new place. You're tiny, you're naked, and you don't speak the language of the natives. How will you protect yourself? How will you get fed? How will you survive? The first house of the horoscope marks the alignment of the western horizon with the zodiac at the moment you drew your first breath. Had you been born someplace else, or slightly earlier or later, a different part of the zodiac may have been rising. The first house describes what makes you unique from all the other babies being born on the same day. And it symbolizes how you, a tiny, naked, terrified infant who's scrambling to get a handle on a new environment, will figure out how to get your needs met.

Babies have a standard repertoire of attention-seeking behaviors—crying, laughing, and grasping. But as a baby grows—as you grew—you developed other strategies for keeping yourself safe, getting what you needed, and figuring out what makes you different from every other baby in the nursery. We find a description of those strategies in the first house of the birth chart.

# Rulerships and Key Concepts

The first house is associated with Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, and with its ruling planet, Mars. Like Aries, the first house belongs to the cardinal quality and the fire element.

Key concepts of the first house : Self, identity, physical body, personality, appearance, beginnings, thresholds, self-defense, war.

# The Ascendant
The angle associated with the first house is called the Ascendant, and it refers to the degree and sign that was rising in the east at the moment and location of your birth. The Ascendant describes your physical body, which is your most instantly recognizable personal characteristic. But it also describes your sense of personal identity, your assertiveness, and how you go about getting what you want. The Ascendant symbolizes the way you handle the world. It's the welcome mat at your door, the receptionist that limits the world's outside contact with you, and your personal body guard. The sign on the Ascendant, as well as its ruling planet, tell us a great deal about what we'll experience when we shake your hand, knock on your door, ask you out on a date, pick a fight with you, or interview you for a job. The Ascendant may or may not reflect much about who you really are inside; it's essentially a Halloween costume you wear year-round.

# Signs

The first house of the chart covers much of the same territory as the sign Aries. In your chart, the first house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the Ascendant and signs contained in the first house
* Planets in the first house
* The planet that rules the sign on the Ascendant

## Aries in the first house

Born with Aries in the first house, you're conditioned to live life on the offensive. You tend to move fast, talk fast, and take action without hesitation. You exude self-confidence and seldom second-guess yourself, traits that make you a magnetic leader. You do have a formidable temper and, when you're feeling insecure, can be pretty domineering. Because you're often in a hurry, Aries rising can tend to be accident prone, especially when angry.

## Taurus in the first house

With Taurus in the first house, you think carefully before speaking or acting. You exude sex appeal and quiet confidence, and win others over with your easygoing charm and magnetism. Others instinctively feel that they can rely on you. Taurus rising can find it difficult to get moving, but once set on a course of action nothing can stop you. You have a long fuse, but when you lose your temper people take notice. The placement of Venus in your birth chart can modify all of these traits. 

# Gemini in the first house

Gemini in the first house is restless and sensitive to external stimuli. You may find it difficult to sit still for long and enjoy the stimulation of sitting in public, people watching and eavesdropping on conversations or chatting with your own friends. With Gemini rising, you rely on your quick wit to defend yourself; you can often get away with saying things that others can't. You're prone to irritability, especially when you've been sitting in one place for too long, but rarely show real anger. When you do, your favored weapon is fast-talking sarcasm.

# Cancer in the first house

Cancer in the first house radiates warmth and humor, but is excruciatingly sensitive to perceived hurts. Because you're vulnerable, you prefer to take an indirect approach in most situations and are a bit wary and defensive with new people. When you trust enough to open up, though, you endear yourself to others with your sweetness, your sense of humor, and your desire to take care of them. You withdraw when you feel threatened, but when you're cornered you defend yourself by getting very snappish; those claws can draw blood!

# Leo in the first house

When you walk in a room, people notice—you have regal bearing, dignity, and charisma. You're friendly with new people, but you're slow to trust them, and you loathe familiarity from strangers. You have a quick and ferocious temper but are generally forgiving of minor transgressions. It's when you become icy that you should really be feared! You generally go on the offensive only to protect those you care about, but you never back down when someone directly threatens you.

# Virgo in the first house

Quirky but quietly attractive, you radiate intelligence, competence, and self-sufficiency. If pressed, you would admit that you find the world pretty tiring and prefer to spend time alone, preferably engaged in some constructive activity. Because you appear to be a substantive person with high standards, others want to please you. Like your fellow Mercury-ruled Gemini Ascendant, you tend toward irritability rather than anger. Unlike Gemini, though, you have a volcanic temper when angered, and your Mercurial facility with words becomes a fearsome weapon.

> **Astro Tip**
>
>The degree on the Ascendant changes approximately every four minutes, and a new sign is rising about every two hours (depending on the sign of the zodiac and the latitude of your birthplace). That's why it's important to know the exact time of birth before calculating a birth chart. Even a few minutes can make a big difference, especially when you are working with predictive tools (see Chapter 23).

# Libra in the first house

You're smooth, Libra rising. You're assertive and proactive, but you're so charming and flattering that others rarely notice what you're up to! The original steel magnolia, you learned early on that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. You're competitive, and good at getting what you want—often because you know whom you need to sweet-talk. Libra rising does get angry, but you're adept at using strategy to disarm your opponent. To paraphrase President Abraham Lincoln, you destroy your enemies by making them your allies.

# Scorpio in the first house

Scorpio in the first house is sign of the secret agent. You may be reasonably friendly, but you don't give away much information about yourself; information is power, and you don't willingly give power to anyone. In a threatening situation, your unerring ability to detect an opponent's weak spots, combined with your control over your emotions, gives you a distinct advantage. You simply devastate your opponent with a withering observation about his Achilles’ heel, then coldly engineer his destruction.

# Sagittarius in the first house

Friendly and open, you never met a stranger and you have nothing to hide. You don't keep secrets because you value your freedom too much to risk being controlled by someone who threatens to expose them. Sagittarius rising often developed self-deprecating humor as a defense mechanism, and deals with threats by making jokes. Sagittarius, like his fellow fire signs, has a quick temper—usually triggered by someone impugning his knowledge or beliefs—but rarely stays angry for long.

# Capricorn in the first house

Your preferred method of dealing with the world is by being a grown-up who handles the pragmatic challenges that daunt lesser mortals. Even when you were young, you probably had to take care of younger siblings—or even your parents. Consequently you grew up fast, and others—including people older than you are—look up to you. Capricorn rising, like his fellow earth sign Ascendants, is slow to anger but scary when he's worked up—cold, sarcastic, and harsh. And other than Scorpio, few signs hold a grudge longer.

# Aquarius in the first house

Aquarius rising is cool and poised, but doesn't quite fit in anywhere—either because you're a little quirky and eccentric, or simply because you're not who others expect to be dealing with a particular situation (male when they expect female, black when they expect white, young when they expect old). Your personality is somewhat reserved, yet everyone seems to know you and most of them like you. You're threatened by attempts to control you, and your weapons are your willingness to cut offenders out of your life permanently, and to take your enemy down even if it means suffering setbacks yourself.

# Pisces in the first house

You're sweet and a little dreamy, and others like you but have a tendency not to take you seriously. You're bubbly and eager to please, and generally quite popular because everyone feels you'll be nice to them. When you’ve been pushed too far, however, you will defend yourself; your main weapons are your ability to escape—you just seem to disappear from the person’s life—and of course, the element of surprise. No one expects you to get angry, and when you do, they’re astonished and a little ashamed of themselves for having offended such a nice person.


# Fourth House: Bloom Where You're Planted

"Where are you from?" In certain parts of the world, that's a question even more ubiquitous than the well-worn "And what do you do?" (which is a question related to the tenth house, opposite from the fourth). And, of course, where you were born and raised, the family in which you spent your formative years, and the rich genealogical loam from which you sprang have an enormous impact on the person you become.

Unlike the first house, in which you fashion your own identity and individual mythology, the fourth house is the umbilical cord that fed you the impulses to create that myth in the first place. Who were "your people"? How did they see themselves, and how did they treat you? Maybe you learned kind lessons from them, and maybe some of the lessons weren't so benign. Certainly, though, they had a big hand in making you what you are.

Many of us never drift far from our familiar beginnings and the people we've known all our lives. Others can't wait to escape the tyranny of our personal history and start over. Can you ever really do that, though, even if you wanted to? If your earliest memories were of magnolias and soft, drawling accents, will you ever feel truly at home in Maine? If you were born in poverty, is it reasonable to assume you'll ever have the confidence of one born to wealth and privilege?

If the first house tells us about the persona you created to handle the world, the fourth house tells us the motivation behind that persona. Where are you from? Are you likely to leave, or is more likely you'll dig in your heels, determined to bloom where you've been planted?

# Rulerships and Key Concepts
The fourth house is associated with the sign of Cancer and its ruler, the Moon. It belongs to the cardinal modality and the water element.

Key concepts of the fourth house: Home, mother, history, birthplace, genealogy

# The IC or Imum Coeli

The angle associated with the fourth house is called the IC, or imum coeli ("lowest heavens"). This angle specifically refers to the degree and sign at the northernmost point in the sky (the lowest point in the chart); it's sometimes called the nadir.

The IC is a sort of umbilical cord that connects you to your home, family, personal history, and subconscious. Think of the IC as a cosmic homing device, helping you find your way to safety whenever you've wandered too far into dangerous territory. The sign on the IC, and its ruling planet, tell us what you need to feel safe and secure, what you're like in your private life, and a lot about your basic motivations. Planets near the IC in your birth chart suggest additional family baggage and emphasize the importance of home, family, or privacy to you.

# Signs

The fourth house of the chart covers much of the same territory as the sign Cancer. In your chart, the fourth house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the IC and signs contained in the fourth house
* Planets in the fourth house
* The planet that rules the sign on the IC

# Aries in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to conflict; you may not have always felt safe. Perhaps there was a military influence in your family; an importance placed on weapons, hunting, or self-defense; or just an environment that forced you to learn to defend yourself. You’re motivated to use what you learned about conflict to help yourself and others find peace and harmony.

# Taurus in the fourth house

Your early home life was likely secure but a bit dull and materialistic. The early emphasis on money and possessions and discomfort with emotionally sensitive subjects motivates you to live simply and honestly, and to develop interests and relationships that you feel passionate about.

# Gemini in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive about your intelligence, competence, and ability to communicate effectively. Perhaps you were considered exceptional in these areas, whether highly intelligent or rather slow. Your primary motivation is to use your intelligence and learning to pursue knowledge and to find meaning in life.

# Cancer in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to nurturing; you may have felt smothered, or else not closely supervised enough. Because you learned to take care of yourself at an early age, or perhaps because you long to prove you can be self-sufficient, your primary motivation is to be independent, worldly, and respected for your competence.

# Leo in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to being noticed; you may have gotten too much special attention, or not enough. Feeling (or wanting to feel) special can be isolating and lonely; your primary motivation is to seek like-minded allies who appreciate your unique gifts while also making you feel as though you fit in.

# Virgo in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to orderliness and health. Whether you lived in a very orderly, health-conscious household or a chaotic one where you lived on junk food, your early environment motivates you to seek a reasonable balance between order and chaos, and between practical affairs and spiritual fulfillment.

# At Home in the Fourth House

The fourth house symbolizes your physical home, and signs in the fourth house describe the kind of home that makes you feel comfortable:

* Aries—New construction, with an office, workshop, and/or fitness room
* Taurus—Comfortable and unpretentious
* Gemini—A home on wheels, or a duplex
* Cancer—Cozy, with pets and family photos
* Leo—Luxurious and impressive
* Virgo—Simple and tidy
* Libra—Harmonious and tasteful
* Scorpio—Dramatic and private
* Sagittarius—On a large lot surrounded by nature; filled with books
* Capricorn—On a hill, classic and well built
* Aquarius—Quirky and unorthodox
* Pisces—Peaceful, quiet, restful

## Libra in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to fairness, good manners, and getting along. There may have been a message at home that being nice is more important than getting ahead. This early emphasis on being nice and playing by the rules motivates you to become more assertive, by using your social skills to help you go after whatever you want out of life.

## Scorpio in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to secrecy and power. You learned from an early age to read between the lines and figure out what was really going on in any situation; you're able to use these skills to improve your security and financial standing. Your primary motivation is to develop relationships with people you can trust and to enjoy life instead of dwelling on its dark side.

# Sagittarius in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to strong beliefs, foreignness, and higher education. Your family may have been immigrants, strongly religious or ideological, or zealous about the importance of higher education; it's likely you always felt like an outsider. Your primary motivation is to cultivate open-mindedness—to question the beliefs you grew up with, and to find a place where you feel like you fit in as part of a community.

# Capricorn in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to responsibility and self-sufficiency. Perhaps you had to care for younger siblings, or maybe strict and even harsh discipline overshadowed nurturing in your family. Your primary motivation is the desire to help others learn to take care of themselves—emotionally as well as materially.

# Aquarius in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to disruption and not fitting in. Your family might have moved often, or an early trauma may have caused considerable upheaval at home. Whatever the reason, your primary motivation is to maintain stability, prepare for the unexpected, and feel as though you belong somewhere.

# Pisces in the fourth house

Your early home life left you sensitive to discord, suffering, and untidiness. There may have been illness or an untimely death in your family, something that undermined the peace, order, and guidance that a young child craves. Your primary motivation is to develop practical confidence and emotional stability that will give you the inner tranquility.

# Seventh House: Meeting the Other

"Like attracts like." "Opposites attract." "Out of sight, out of mind." "Absence makes the heart grow fonder." Platitudes about love and relationships are confusing, and offer numerous mixed messages. Which is it, then: are we meant to be with someone who is like us, or someone who is different enough to balance our weaknesses with their strengths? Is it healthier to spend a certain amount of time away from our partner, or is that inviting estrangement and indiscretions?

There's no single answer to these questions, of course, which is why the language, music, literature, and art devoted to the topic of love and relationships are so contradictory.

Sometimes, we expect a partner to fill in the gaps of our own development—assertive where we're timid, witty where we're dull. This approach can work, but it can also backfire in a string of relationships with people who are temperamentally incompatible. The seventh house's message of balance suggests that the ideal partner is one who encourages you to fill in your own gaps, someone who teaches by example but who insists that you strive to be your best, most complete self. It's interesting that the seventh house, along with symbolizing marriage, partners, and close friends, is the house of "open enemies." A wise person once told me that "your enemies are your treasure. They show you the best and worst of what you can be." Pay attention to the best qualities of your rivals, because those are the qualities you need to develop in yourself. Then find a partner that can help you be those things.

The seventh house is associated with the sign of Libra and its ruling planet, Venus. Like Libra, the seventh house belongs to the cardinal modality and the air element.

Key concepts for the seventh house : Partners, marriage, close friends, open enemies, customers, the public marketplace, negotiation, balance.

# The Descendant

The Descendant, opposite the Ascendant, is the cusp of the seventh house and represents the western horizon, where the Sun sets. This is the pivotal relationship point of the chart. Planets close to this angle in your birth chart, or crossing over it by transit and progression, symbolize relationship timing.

# Signs

The seventh house of the chart covers much of the same territory as the sign Libra. In your chart, the seventh house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The sign on the Descendant and signs contained in the seventh house
* Planets in the seventh house
* The planet that rules the sign on the Descendant

## Aries in the seventh house

Your rivals are assertive and decisive, and your ideal partners help you develop these qualities in yourself. Because you tend to avoid conflict and approach others diplomatically, you're often drawn to partners who are very assertive and direct, even abrasive. As they teach you to be more assertive, you teach them how to be more diplomatic.

## Taurus in the seventh house

Your rivals are calm and stable, and your ideal partners help you develop these qualities in yourself. Because you are intense and secretive, you're often drawn to partners who are easygoing and uncomplicated. As they guide you toward greater stability and emotional security, you help them confront uncomfortable emotions and find their passion.

## Gemini in the seventh house

Your rivals have an open mind and the gift of gab; your ideal partners help you develop these qualities in yourself. You can have a tendency to be a bit naive and trusting, and to pretend you know more than you do, and so you're drawn to partners who are canny, skeptical, and questioning. They help you keep an open mind, and you help them figure out what believe.

# Cancer in the seventh house

Your rivals are nurturing and giving, and your ideal partners help you develop these qualities in yourself. Because you're pragmatic and ambitious, you're drawn to partners who are sensitive and nurturing. They help you keep in touch with the emotional side of your decisions; you encourage them to pursue their goals and to take things less personally.

# Leo in the seventh house

Your rivals are confident and know how to get noticed; your ideal partners help you develop these qualities. You have the ability to get along with just about anyone in any situation, and you're drawn to partners who demand to be acknowledged as special. They help you realize that being true to oneself is as important as fitting in; you remind them that individuals can have greater impact when they form alliances with others.

# Virgo in the seventh house

Your rivals are capable and discriminating; your ideal partners help you develop these qualities. Because you empathize with everyone and aren't terribly practical, you're drawn to partners who make sure the bills get paid on time and are choosy about the company they keep. They teach you to be more practical and avoid getting taken advantage of; you teach them to enjoy life—and other people—more.

**Astro Alert**

"There are no planets in my seventh house," you moan. "Does that mean I'll never get married?" No, an "empty" seventh house doesn't mean that at all. (Actress Elizabeth Taylor has been married eight times, despite having not a single planet in her seventh house!) Look to the planet that rules the sign on the Descendant to tell the story of whom, how, and when you'll marry.

# Libra in the seventh house

Your rivals are charming and cooperative, and your ideal partners help you develop these qualities. You're a "shoot first, ask questions later" kind of person, and you're drawn to partners who are polite and have good social skills. They teach you about the power of using charm and persuasion to get what you want; you teach them to be assertive and decisive in pursuing their goals.

# Scorpio in the seventh house

Your rivals are passionate and intense; your ideal partners help you develop these qualities. You're an easygoing, self-effacing type who is drawn to passionate, emotionally dramatic partners. They teach you to understand what's going on beneath the surface of your life, while you help them develop trust, patience, and humor.

# Sagittarius in the seventh house

Your rivals have strong beliefs and the ability to laugh at themselves; your ideal partners help you develop these qualities. You're a restless, curious, wisecracking jack of all trades; you're drawn to partners who are focused, intellectually confident, and knowledgeable. They encourage you to see the big picture; you help them from becoming a know-it-all.

# Capricorn in the seventh house

Your rivals are ambitious and worldly; your ideal partners help you develop these qualities. You wear your heart on your sleeve and are preoccupied with home, family, and security; you're drawn to partners who keep their feelings to themselves and have worldly ambitions. They help you open your mind to a larger world beyond your little corner of it, and you help them remember that ambition isn't everything.

# Aquarius in the seventh house

Your rivals are iconoclastic and independent; your ideal partners help you develop these qualities. You consider yourself special and a bit extraordinary, and you're drawn to partners who treat you like an equal. They help keep you from becoming imperious and self-important; you teach them that everyone is special—at least, to their partner.

# Pisces in the seventh house

Your rivals are fun-loving and empathetic; your ideal partners help you develop these qualities. You have high standards and a low tolerance for frivolity, and you’re drawn to partners who are accepting of others and who live in the moment. They help you loosen your tight hold on perfectionism and enjoy life; you help them untangle problems and take a responsible approach to the practical side of life.

# Tenth House: Who's Your Daddy?

My teacher used to say that the first house and the Ascendant describes the impression someone gets when they meet you face-to-face. But the tenth house and the Midheaven symbolize the reputation that precedes you—what someone perceives to be true about you based on your public persona, including your job, your father's work, or where you went to school.

When I occasionally visit the small farming community where I was born and where my family had lived for generations, I'm recognized immediately, no matter how much older I've gotten. Most of the people I meet don't know me at all. But they knew my parents, what my father did for a living, what fraternal lodge he belonged to, and how much land we owned. Based on all that, they probably feel they have a pretty good idea of who I am.

The tenth house describes this inherited reputation. But it also symbolizes the need to create your own reputation, one that's deliberate, and earned: to be the author of your own life. One way this is done is through your work, or more specifically what used to be called a "calling." You might be called to raise a family, to raise wheat, or develop iPhone applications. A calling doesn't necessarily pay the bills; in fact, you may have to take a job to support pursuing your calling. But whether you earn money with it or not, you'll only feel like a success if you heed the tenth house's call.

# Rulerships and Key Concepts

The tenth house is associated with the sign of Capricorn and its ruling planet, Saturn. Like Capricorn, the tenth house is associated with the angular modality and the earth element.

Key concepts for the tenth house: Career, status, authority, being the boss, being a paternal and mentoring figure.

# The Midheaven

The angle associated with the tenth house is called the Midheaven; it refers to the degree and sign that was directly overhead at the moment and location of your birth. The Midheaven symbolizes the way the world sees you. It's the angle of career, calling, authority, and reputation; if you were famous, it's the kind of information about you that appears in magazines, subject to distortion and misunderstanding.

The Midheaven describes the way you approach your career, and possibly something about the nature of your career. But it also symbolizes the heights you aspire to reach, some qualities of character that, if you were to realize them, would make you feel that your life is a success.

# Signs

The tenth house of the chart covers much of the same territory as the sign Capricorn. In your chart, the tenth house is also strongly influenced by the following:

* The ruling planet of the sign on the Midheaven
* Planets in the tenth house Aspects from other planets to the Midheaven
