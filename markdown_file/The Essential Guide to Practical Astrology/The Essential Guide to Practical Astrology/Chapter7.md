## Water Signs

Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces are the water signs: sensitive, empathetic, and intuitive

Cancer is home-loving, protective, and nurturing
Scorpio is perceptive, probing, and fearless
Pisces is compassionate, intuitive, and artistic

Why are waterfront properties generally much more valuable than their landlocked counterparts? It's because we find the view soothing and inspiring. Beyond its hypnotic and restful powers, water also plays an essential role in sustaining life. We humans can live without food for a couple of weeks, but only three to five days without water. Perhaps something in us—maybe the 60 percent of our bodies that are composed of water—finds it subliminally reassuring to be close to a ready supply.

Water is an element that nurtures us both physically and spiritually.

The signs of the zodiac associated with the water element are nurturing as well, and they're also known for their power to inspire through music, poetry, writing, and other forms of art. Theirs is not the self-expressive creativity of the fire signs, but rather an ability to tap into and reflect what others are feeling. A water sign really does feel your pain. And because they have the gift of sensitivity, they also bear the burden of vulnerability. If water signs sometimes seem defensive, it's because they're so easily hurt by the choppy waves of modern life.

Each of the three water signs has distinct characteristics all its own. But they all share in common the qualities of sensitivity, receptivity, empathy, artistry, and contemplative spirituality.

# Cancer, the Crab

The Sun's ingress into Cancer marks the summer solstice, when the sun appears to stand still in its movement across the horizon, then turn around and move the other way. In the midst of summer vacations and trips to the beach, the Sun's journey through Cancer calls for reflection.

Who we are is a construction of the family, culture, and moment in history into which we're born. But there's also a core element that makes you uniquely you. It's the job of Cancer to locate that inner compass point.

The Chaldeans, who developed a 12-constellation system that was a precursor to the zodiac, considered Cancer, the sign of the Sun's greatest elevation, to be nearest to the highest point of heaven. In his book *Star Names, Their Lore and Meaning* (Dover Publications, 1963), R. H. Allen wrote that the constellation was known as "the Gate of Men," the portal through which souls made their way to earth. Not surprisingly, Cancer is the sign associated with motherhood.

The formidable matriarchs in all our lives orient us in the world by insisting on the importance of things essential and irreplaceable: history, family, lineage.

You are most likely to identify with the sign of Cancer if

* You were born with the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant in Cancer, or with the Sun or Ascendant in close aspect to the Moon.
* You were born with a number of planets in the fourth house.
* You were born with the Moon in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house.

# What Makes Cancer Tick

I love vintage Airstream trailers—so cute, cozy, and self-contained. Shiny, portable shelter, these little land dinghies have always made me think of a crab's shell: a way of carrying home with us even as we cruise the continent. There's no more apt metaphor for the home-loving sign of Cancer would rather be at home (or at least surrounded by loved ones) than visit the most exotic locations on earth. Familiar objects, food, and landmarks comfort you and make you feel safe. "There's no place like home," was the magical refrain of The Wizard of Oz's Dorothy, one of the most Cancerian characters in film history.

Nor is it accidental that Cancer is named for the crab, a creature prized for its delicious meat and for which self-protection, therefore, is understandably a high priority. The crab's tough shell, erratic movements, and formidable claws provide some protection, and the astrological Cancer is metaphorically equipped with similar weaponry—a reticence with strangers, an indirect manner, and a tendency to get snappish when you feel threatened.

**Cancer at its best**: Family-oriented, nurturing, intuitive, domestic, maternal, sensitive, sympathetic, emotional, patriotic, retentive, traditional

**Cancer on a bad day**: Moody, touchy, oversensitive, negative, manipulative, overly cautious

## How to Spot a Cancer

A Cancerian, male or female, is as comforting and nurturing as the mom in a 1950s sitcom. You find yourself wanting to confide in this kind person with the soft eyes, who offers you a cookie and agrees that the world has been pretty mean to you, all right.

Cancer evokes images of the full moon in a summer night sky, reflected in the shimmering waters of the ocean. But think for a moment about the warm days of Cancer's season, and you'll understanding the comforting warmth and charisma of these tender souls.

When Cancer is feeling threatened, though, the defenses kick in. First, disappearing into the shell—the body language stiffens, the face becomes an impassive mask. Second, the erratic movements so you can't exactly tell what he'll do next. Finally, if you ignore these signals and keep approaching, the claws make their appearance, and Cancer can be quite nasty when cornered.

The Cancer archetype: The universal mother

The Cancer stereotype: The smothering mother

## Cancer in Love

In matters of the heart, Cancer is sweet, nurturing, and a bit old-fashioned. You'll do anything for the one you love; you'll cook dinner, press a shirt, take care of invalids, work two jobs. All you ask in return are loyalty and appreciation.

When Cancer is young, you often fall in love fairly quickly, usually with someone who isn't very nice. But getting your heart broken a few times usually teaches you that even when you fall fast, you should reveal your feelings very slowly. It takes you awhile to feel safe with someone; your trust has to be earned.

In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, singer Linda Ronstadt, born with the Sun in Cancer, talked about how she had learned to cope with having had her heart broken so often.

"I try to walk that fine line between being strong and trying to avoid becoming callous. As soon as you're callous you not only shut out all the pain, but all the good stuff too. You either close the door or you open it. I keep the door open with the screen door slammed and a strong dog at the door. That's the policy of my heart."

Only a cruel person toys with the heart of the vulnerable crab. And when you've been crossed, you buy a screen door and a big, strong dog. For Cancer, old grudges become part of the fortress that you think will protect you from further injury—but if you're not careful, it can also prevent you from forming satisfying relationships.

Most compatible signs: Your fellow water signs, Scorpio and Pisces, who understand your sensitive heart and tread lightly around your feelings; earth signs Taurus and Virgo, who soothe you with their practicality and solid support

Most challenging signs: Your fellow cardinal signs. Capricorn, your opposite sign, is as tough as you are tender; Aries is too independent to take kindly to mothering; and Libra has a breezy cerebral quality that can feel overwhelmed by your emotionalism.

# Cancer at Work

Cancer is the sign of family, and if you've ever worked for a small, family-owned business, you know both the blessings and hazards of the Cancerian workplace. Cancer creates a work environment that's nurturing and protective, and flourishes in occupations that thrive on these qualities. Because of Cancer's tenacity, willingness to sacrifice, and loyalty to employees and customers, you have the capacity to build strong organizations.

All of my favorite local business people have a couple of things in common. First, they share a warm, welcoming spirit that makes me feel appreciated. And second, every one of them is wildly successful. They include a hairdresser who is booked a month in advance, a mechanic who is so busy he had to rent a new building last year, and a family-owned restaurant that always makes me feel welcome and at home when I stop by for enchiladas. They epitomize the Cancerian approach to work: creating both financial and interpersonal success by treating their customers like family.

But the Cancer energy can also turn stifling and tribal, with overt favoritism shown to intimates. Cancer can find it difficult to be assertive and direct, and this can lead to workplace misunderstandings. And Cancer's tenacity can become a liability if you refuse to let go of past conflicts, or to move on to new ways of doing things as the business environment changes.

Cancer-friendly careers: Cancer's family-loving side is taken with genealogy, history, and memorabilia; your domestic side does well in food-related careers like catering, nutrition, or restaurant management. If medically inclined you might be drawn to nursing, midwifery, obstetrics, gynecology, or pediatrics. Naturally frugal, you'd be a good financial manager, and your feel for homes gives you the edge in real estate, property management, or feng shui.

# Scorpio, the Scorpion

The Sun moves through Scorpio in the second month of autumn, when the leaves have already mostly fallen from the trees and cold weather creeps in. The celebrations of Halloween, Samhain (Celtic New Year, which includes harvest themes and festivals to honor the dead), and Dia de los Muertos (the Mexican "Day of the Dead") fall during the Sun's season in Scorpio, and there is a long tradition linking this sign to death, decay, and regeneration. Some things must end before new things can begin, and Scorpio symbolizes this process.

Death is an uncomfortable, even taboo subject. But Scorpio understands that life and death are two sides of the same coin, as incomplete without one another as day is incomplete without night. We see the call and response of life and death in agriculture, in the lunar phases, in the seasons; life carries a price tag of eventual death, and death is, perhaps, the portal to another kind of life. Of all the signs, Scorpio grasps that without the knowledge of death, life loses its urgency and its value.

Scorpio teaches us that life, like a temperamental lover, sometimes likes to test our commitment by showing us its ugly side. It's easy to love life when it is kind to us, when it makes sense and makes us feel good. But can we love it when it is harsh and disappointing and determined to break our hearts? Scorpio answers, "Yes." Scorpio commits to life with passion—to dancing with that temperamental lover, and to tasting every dish at life's banquet table—with spirit and with joy.

You are most likely to identify with Scorpio if

* You were born with the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant in Scorpio or in close aspect to Pluto.
* You were born with a number of planets in the eighth house.
* You were born with Pluto in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house.

# What Makes Scorpio Tick

Of all the signs of the zodiac, Scorpio is almost certainly the most misunderstood—both by its detractors and its advocates. Its defining characteristic is its need for trust. If you're born with this sign strong in your birth chart, you constantly test people to make sure they deserve your loyalty. You have an unerring instinct for identifying others' sensitive spots, and you don't hesitate to probe them as an engineer might test a support beam with a sharp tool to gauge the extent to which termites have undermined its strength.

It's this probing quality that makes others uncomfortable around Scorpio. If you are a strong and secure Scorpio, this quality can be put to excellent use in helping others confront their own weaknesses and transcend them, often as a counselor, therapist, or hypnotist—but just as often, as a good and loyal friend or family member. But Scorpio, like all signs, has weaknesses, too. If you feel threatened, you lash out at others with a stinging, sarcastic tongue. When you're insecure you can be manipulative, secretive, and extremely jealous. This is the weakened wood in your own support beam, and must be confronted and transcended if you're to be your best self.

Scorpio at its best: Determined, probing, brave, passionate, insightful, empathetic, penetrating, investigative, powerful

Scorpio on a bad day: Jealous, suspicious, sarcastic, secretive, vengeful, manipulative

# How to Spot a Scorpio

Generally, there seem to be two distinct varieties of Scorpio. There are those who proudly proclaim their sign, thinking it has menacing and powerful cache; these people tend to wear black and have a lot of body piercings. Then there are those who are reluctant to reveal anything about themselves, either out of a sense of self-protectiveness or because they simply find it more interesting to focus on others. You'll recognize them by their sunglasses and close-lipped demeanor.

The Scorpio person is deeply loyal. He doesn't give his trust easily, but if you've earned his, you have a friend for life. It's rather like having Don Corleone, the eponymous capo of The Godfather, on your side.

The Scorpio archetype: The magician, able to transcend the laws of nature to achieve transformation
The Scorpio stereotype: A secret agent, skilled at investigative work and most comfortable working behind the scenes

# Scorpio in Love
If you're born with Scorpio prominent in your chart, you may fall in love regularly—you are a sensitive water sign, after all, and you're especially susceptible to lost souls who appear to need your help. But before you really commit to another person, you have to know you can trust them completely. That means they must prove their honesty and their loyalty. They also need to demonstrate that they can deal with the menacing side of your nature, and won't be too impressed by your temper tantrums or vows to seek revenge.

Once you've determined that someone meets these criteria, you are a passionate, if somewhat possessive lover. As long as you are sure you can trust your partner, you will be their fiercest advocate.

**Most compatible signs:** Fellow water signs Cancer and Pisces, who understand the sensitivity that underlies your tough exterior; earth signs Virgo and Capricorn, who have keen minds that you respect and who refuse to be intimidated by you

**Most challenging signs:** Your fellow fixed signs. Taurus, your opposite sign, can be too nonchalant and low energy for you; Leo and Aquarius are so gregarious and sociable that you get tired of being part of their entourage.

Over time, Scorpio has been associated with three symbols: the scorpion, the eagle, and the serpent. Modern astrologers feel that the scorpion and serpent symbolize Scorpio's lower nature, while the eagle symbolizes the proud and soaring nature of the evolved Scorpio type.

# Scorpio at Work
Because you are drawn to absorbing, probing work requiring a high degree of analysis, you do your best work alone. Careers that allow you to dig deep into the core of things will always keep you interested. Because few can match your intensity or earn your trust, you're not usually a good team player, and you're quite protective of your ideas and of the work you've done.

You're drawn to the kinds of work that others may find unpleasant or frightening, from plumbing to crime scene investigation. You're talented at understanding what makes people tick, and if you're inclined, you would do very well in careers that help others understand themselves better.

Scorpio-friendly careers: You're a natural sleuth, so research and detective work might suit you. You also have a knack for getting inside people's heads, so you may be suited to hypnosis, psychology, or astrology. Scorpio is associated with shared resources, so you could also work in insurance or as a bill collector. You have a cool head in emergencies, so you could be a good surgeon, EMT, lifeguard, or security guard. Mars's rulership of your sign indicates an affinity for knives, so you could be a butcher or, if artistically inclined, a sculptor. And Pluto's rulership gives you a penchant for jobs involving what's hidden or taboo, such as plumber, locksmith, mortician, coroner, embalmer, or mortician.

In March, the season when the Sun moves through Pisces, the days grow longer but the late winter light is weak and flat under cloudy skies. March weather is notoriously changeable and unreliable, yielding an uneasy melange of delicate late-winter flowers and tempestuous storms.

In the Pisces season, nature offers a tantalizing glimpse of a vernal paradise, then delights in blowing it down and washing it away.

When we're young we lack a truly mature root structure to hold us in place. Consequently, we're a bit like March saplings that snap under a forceful gale: we can be felled with a strong breath or a harsh word. The older we get and more set in our ways, the more water and wind it generally takes to knock us down. Our sense of self grows stronger; we learn what to tune out, and how to regulate the amount of negativity we'll pay attention to. But this is a bit like tuning in to a favorite radio station: you're sure to hear something you like, but often lose some interesting possibilities in the static-y never-never land between frequencies.

As the last sign of the zodiac, Pisces symbolizes endings, illness and recuperation, imprisonment, and spiritual enlightenment. However, Jupiter, the king of the gods, was considering the ruling planet of Pisces before the discovery of Neptune, and Pisces people—like the tender saplings that take root during their season—are rarely as delicate as they seem.

You are most likely to identify with Pisces if
* You were born with the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant in Pisces or in close aspect to Neptune.
* You were born with a number of planets in the twelfth house.
* You were born with Neptune in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house.

Pisces is the only one of the water signs that's symbolized by a creature without an exoskeleton—fish are protected only by scales. This symbolizes Pisces' vulnerability and occasional difficulty with maintaining personal boundaries.

Contrary to pop astrology clichés, Pisces is no more spiritual, psychic, or saintly than any other sign—but he is more vulnerable. The symbol for Pisces is two fish, the most tender of creatures; Cancer and Scorpio swim in the same empathetic waters, but only Pisces navigates them without a protective shell, completely exposed to both danger and ecstasy. Pisces teaches us divine vulnerability—how to lower our defenses, the better to fully empathize and blend with everyone we meet.

Like every sign, Pisces walks a razor's edge between its nobler and its baser sides, which in the case of Pisces can make itself felt in a certain lack of constancy. Pisces is compassionate and supportive; but if you lean too hard on him, he'll swim away in the blink of an eye. On one hand, this is an admirable survival skill. You can't absorb the whole world's pain and misery 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and stay sane. You've simply got to get away from time to time, whether in a nap, a bottle, a song, or a massage. The strongest and wisest of Pisces pay close attention to their need for healthy escape. Pisces is tempted by the notion that we are one with everything, a limitless river; but without boundaries, the river overflows, often with destructive consequences.

At its best, though, the Pisces experience is one of pure enchantment. I admire Pisces as I admire water, for its quickness and its stillness, its adaptability and shape-shifting abilities.

Pisces is the exotic music we hear faintly, through static, between the stronger frequencies; it is the fragile pre-spring flowers outside my office window, their seeds scattered here by the wind, pale and pretty in the flat, gray light of late winter—they are the youngest and most tender of flowers, yet they stand up to sudden storms with surprising strength, refusing to be blown down or washed away.

Pisces at its best: Sympathetic, compassionate, emotional, intuitive, musical, artistic

Pisces on a bad day: Impractical, timid, procrastinator

# How to Spot Pisces

One of my favorite examples of Pisces is the character of Cosmo Kramer on the long-running television series Seinfeld. While eccentric, Kramer was also kind and helpful and had the uncanny ability to fall into sync with whoever was around him, unknowingly voicing precisely the same sentiments another character has expressed in an earlier scene. Pisces is so good at assuming the mood and posture of whatever situation he's in that he's rather like a chameleon—you have to work hard to notice him.

On the other hand, there are clues. Pisces tends to have a rather fluid sense of time, so it's possible that friend who is consistently late for every lunch date has a strong Pisces influence in his birth chart. On the plus side, that fluid sense of time allows Pisces to accomplish an enormous amount in a given day, because he's not worried about whether he has time to do everything.

Pisces is also the gentle clown who leads sing-alongs around the campfire, who drives an old VW bus plastered with bumper stickers like "Imagine whirled peas," who gives you a sentimental birthday card. He's Everyman—and yet he's not like anyone else you've ever met.

The Pisces archetype: The mystic 
The Pisces stereotype: The flake

# Pisces in Love

You're exceedingly sentimental and idealistic, plying the objects of your affection with flowers, goopy cards, and romantic mix tapes. Yours is a sunny, accepting, celebratory attitude toward love. But because you want to believe the best of everyone, you're not always the best judge of character, and the sensitivity and compassion that make you so dear can cause problems. You're more susceptible than most to adopting a rescuer mentality, and your early relationships are often with negative, irresponsible, even abusive partners.

What Pisces brings to a relationship is a whimsical sensibility, a joyful approach to life, surprising strength, and a warm and empathetic spirit. What you need in a partner is someone who is gentle and kind, but who can still help you cope with the knotty, practical, inconvenient details of everyday life.

Most compatible signs: Your fellow water signs, Cancer and Scorpio, who understand your sensitive nature and are naturally protective of you; earth signs Taurus and Capricorn, who provide a grounding influence and help you cope with the practical demands of daily life.

Most challenging signs: Your opposite sign, Virgo, shares your compassion and adaptability but lacks your gentle imagination. Gemini and Sagittarius can injure your feelings with their witticisms and bluntness.

# Pisces at Work

The trick for Pisces is to find work that plays to your strengths. You're good with people, you understand the latest trends in whatever field you're involved with, and when you set your mind to it you can squeeze an amazing amount of productivity out of a single day.

The problem is getting you to set your mind to it. It can be a challenge for you to be punctual or to hew to tight deadlines. Your best bet is to find a career in which these things just aren't as important as being sweet, inspiring, and helpful—all of which are qualities you possess in spades.

You're a natural in the helping professions, especially those with a spiritual dimension. And you usually have at least one or two social or humanitarian causes that are extremely dear to your heart that would benefit from your involvement. For instance, you have a wonderful knack for putting together social events that generate fun and excitement and could easily put those skills to work as a party planner, entertainer, or fund-raising coordinator.

Pisces-friendly careers: You'll thrive at anything that allows you to help others—counseling, guiding retreats and meditations, working for charitable or nonprofit organizations, the ministry, working in hospitals or in health care. You've got a metaphysical bent, particularly toward clairvoyance, scrying (reading crystal balls), or tarot, and you're artistic with a particular flair for painting, photography, and music. Fishermen and others who work on boats come under the purview of Pisces, as do prison workers, bartenders, and podiatrists.
