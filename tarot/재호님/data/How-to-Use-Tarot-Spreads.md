# Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION TO TAROT

THERE HAS BEEN MUCH INFORMATION AND conjecture on the beginnings of Tarot, but no conclusive proof of its origins. Many people believe that Tarot was discovered in the fourteenth century and have woven stories around this idea in order to support their premise. One thing is for sure—the Tarot works! The cards have been in use for centuries and that is proof enough of their authenticity.

As a beginner, the more books you read about Tarot, the more confident you will become. The Tarot cards are ideal tools for meditation, and by working with the cards this way you will discover further information about them that you will not find in books.

The following pages provide thumbnail sketches of the upright and reversed meanings of each card based on a system I developed in my book *How to Read the Tarot: The Key Word System*. Some readers prefer to use the cards in their upright meanings only. If it works for them, great! If you wish to use reversed cards in your reading, cut your deck into two parts, turn one in the opposite direction and shuffle the cards together. Have faith, the cards work no matter if upright or reversed. Enjoy the spreads and be sure to try the Magical Lottery spread. Who knows, you could win!


# PREPARING A READING

Reading Tarot spreads is easy. Follow the steps outlined below for a positive Tarot reading:

* Select a type of spread that best fits the circumstances the querent (the person you are reading for) would like to examine in the reading.
* Have the querent shuffle the deck of Tarot cards. Ask the person to make a wish and concentrate on their question. If they desire, they can cut the cards.
* Have the querent hand the cards back to you, the reader.
* Lay the cards out according to the format of the selected spread.
* Look over the spread and check for repeated elements:
    * How many Wands appear?
    * How many Cups?
    * How many Pentacles?
    * How many Swords?
* Check the numbers of each card and notice if those are repeated.
* Are there many Major Arcana or Court Cards? If there are, then too many people are involved in the querent's life.
* Read the cards either right side up or reversed, depending on how they fall in the spread. Some readers will read the cards using only the upright meanings. If it works, fine!
* Try to end the reading on a positive note, but be as truthful as possible.
* Do not read too many spreads for the same person on a single day—it will create confusion in that person's mind. Tell this individual that they must wait a week before you read for them again.

**Note:** If any cards falls out of the deck during shuffling, be sure to read those as well. All of these cards have information concerning the querent. Check the bottom card of the deck after you have laid out the spread; there is a message there as well.

**Beginner Tarot readers:** Read through the book first and then try your skill at reading the spreads. Experience is the best teacher and reading for others hones your talents and enhances your intuition. Trust yourself always.

The reader has an obligation to the client which must not be taken lightly. Be responsible with the information and be blessed.

At times the Page indicates a feminine male child or a strong female child. The Pages can be deceptive!

## A New Lover for Rachel

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD

lst    position       Queen of Pentacles 
2nd    position       10 of Pentacles 
3rd    position       King of Pentacles 
4th    position       Temperance 
5th    position       7 of Wands (Reversed) 
6th    position       Ace of Cups (Reversed) 

### READING
**Question 1:** Will there be a new relationship for me soon?
**Answer:** Queen of Pentacles. This Queen is involved with making money and interested in health and healing. Rachel is an idealist and a perfectionist. She is now enrolled in college where she will meet lots of new people. Rachel is only seventeen, and quite shy. The potential for a relationship during the winter could prove interesting!!

**Question 2:** What astrological sign will this person be?
**Answer:** 10 of Pentacles. All Pentacles refer to Earth signs. Rachel is a Capricorn and perhaps she will attract an Earth sign into her life!

**Question 3:** Will we be compatible?
**Answer:** King of Pentacles. This is an Earth sign (Taurus). They can be compatible as long as he is financially stable. Rachel seems interested in social services and she would like a partner who cares about others. Earth sign relationships can be compatible if they are practical and sharing. Capricorns wish for success and can push their partners to attain their own goals.

**Question 4:** Will this be a lasting relationship?
**Answer:** Temperance. Rachel needs self-control, harmony, and balance. This card is ruled by Sagittarius, which is a freedom sign. They rarely stay in relationships for long periods of time. Learning about partners or mates takes time. Take a trip now!

**Question 5:** Will this person be my soul mate?
**Answer:** 7 of Wands (Reversed). This is the first reversed card in this spread. This card shows no victory and feeling socially inferior or incompetent. Path unclear for the future. Rachel may be disappointed with this individual and find he is not what she thought he was.

**Question 6:** What is the outcome of my desire?
**Answer:** Ace of Cups (Reversed). Rachel does not foresee any new beginnings in love relationships for herself. There is emotional instability and she feels drained. She is ready to begin her first semester in college and feels uncertain. Rachel is seventeen and talks of waiting a year before entering college.

**Comment:** Rachel's parents insist she go to school or work. She does not drive, so work may be difficult. Rachel is a Capricorn and she needs a career focus. A good education can teach her to become financially independent. It is hard for young adults to make decisions with so many possibilities.

## A New Lover for Denny 

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st position Ace of Pentacles (Reversed)
2nd position Knight of Wands
3rd position 5 of Swords
4th position 9 of Pentacles (Reversed)
5th position Page of Wands
6th position 10 of Pentacles (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** Will there be a new relationship for me soon?
**Answer:** Ace of Pentacles (Reversed). This card tells Denny that there will not be any new beginnings especially in money matters. It takes money to go places and do things with a new relationship—now is a time to conserve resources and balance the budget.

**Question 2:** What astrological sign will this person be?
**Answer:** Knight of Wands. This Knight, a Leo, brings messages concerning work and social activities. Good news relating to work, a trip, or a change of residence. Relationships or other happy events are coming soon. If the new lover is a Leo, this person will expect attention—to be at center stage. Leos have great expectations, are very creative, and have a great sense of humor.

**Question 3: Will we be compatible?**
**Answer:** 5 of Swords. Compatibility means getting along well with others. This card indicates Denny believes in problems and has the desire to overcome others due to his ego needs. This type of rash behavior may be the cause of his lack of friends and relationships. Denny has many desires and this clouds his judgment. Leos are extremely powerful people and Denny should be aware that they can be powerful adversaries.

**Question 4: Will this be a lasting relationship?**
**Answer:** 9 of Pentacles (Reversed). Denny seems overly concerned with money matters. When reversed, this card indicates feelings of dependency. It also reflects a lack of wisdom gained through past experiences, loss through friends, or unwise investments. This relationship will last as long as it does not need money to keep it going.

**Question 5: Will this person be my soul mate?**
**Answer:** Page of Wands. This Page is a fire sign, as is the Leo from question 2, eager to experience work and social life. They desire freedom, want independence, and love to travel. Action is the aim and goal of this Page. Denny stays close to home, is bound to his job, and will not spend his money without just cause. Perhaps they can teach each other significant experiences to polish each other's character. It is possible they are soul mates!

**Question 6:** What is the outcome of my desire?
**Answer:** 10 of Pentacles (Reversed). There will not be any significant change in Denny's financial picture. The only difference will be in his mental attitude. Be happy!

**Comment:** Half of the cards in this spread are reversed, which shows a negative focus. Denny seems more interested in freedom and money than in a new and lasting relationship. He needs time to grow and mature. Denny's values have not been formed and his sense of responsibility must be activated.

### READING
**Question 1:** What is the attraction?
**Answer:** Sun. Susan sees this man as open, honest, energetic, and youthful. He wants attention, has great expectations (not unreasonable, according to Susan), and wants to be a shining star!

**Question 2:** Is this person loving?
**Answer:** Queen of Cups (Reversed). Susan feels he is intense but has an emotional drain regarding women. This Queen can be an implacable enemy—mean and hateful if wronged. This man does not love easily.

**Question 3:** Can we have fun together?
**Answer:** 5 of Wands. There could be ego problems between Susan and her new friend. This card indicates a belief held by Susan that she wants her way in work and socially. This could lead to confrontations between Susan and her new relationship. Fighting can be fun but what will the results be for them?

**Question 4: Can we work together and support each other?**
**Answer:** 2 of Wands (Reversed). Susan does not know how secure she is in this relationship. She does not know this person very well or for any length of time, however, they had an instant rapport. Unfortunately he lives out of state, which poses problems. Only time will tell!

**Question 5: Will there be sexual compatibility?**
**Answer:** High Priestess (Reversed). Susan indicated that it was too early to be involved with this man in a sexually intimate way. She has some fears regarding this relationship and has decided to be cautious. Susan said she did not know when she would see him again.

**Question 6: Will our families get along?**
**Answer:** 2 of Cups (Reversed). Susan feels that both families may try to come between her and her new love. This would create an emotional drain and force Susan and her partner to make decisions they are not ready to make. Susan must understand that a good loving relationship is very healthy and worth fighting for, regardless of family interference.

**Question 7: Are there religious differences?**
**Answer:** 9 of Pentacles (Reversed). There are no problems with religious beliefs, but Susan feels she lacks wisdom with money and there may be a fear of having to confront that issue. She does not feel like an independently wealthy woman and her new love comes from a very wealthy family.

**Question 8:** Will we have problems with power and money?
**Answer:** 4 of Swords. Susan is creating her own problems and troubles. She must realize that her insecurities are driving her to distraction. Now is the time for her to rest, pray, and have faith in herself. If she and her new love are in balance they can work out any problems.

**Question 9:** Is this a long-term relationship?
**Answer:** 9 of Swords. Susan is in crisis. She can only see problems and troubles in regard to this relationship. It is almost too good to be true. This man is young, attractive, and he has money! There could be a fear that she does not deserve this wonderful relationship, but why not? If Susan is not careful, it will be over before she has a chance to get involved.

**Question 10:** What is the outcome?
**Answer:** King of Cups (Reversed). Susan is feeling drained emotionally and is afraid of losing control. She has a fear of loving and giving her heart away and being hurt in the process. Susan must understand that she must take a chance and believe that it will work.

**Comment:** Love is the answer to Susan's dilemma. Everyone deserves happiness in life and if money comes with it, all the better! However, since this reading Susan spent time with this person, but the relationship has ended.

## A Romantic Attraction for Larry

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
lst    position    3 of Swords 
2nd    position    King of Pentacles 
3rd    position    Ace of Wa nds (Reversed) 
4th    position    8 of Swords 
5th    position    7 of Wands 
6th    position    Page of Pentacles 
7th    position    6 of Pentacles 
8th    position    The Lovers (Reversed) 
9th    position    Page of Wands 
1Oth   position    5 of Pentacles 

### READING
**Question 1:** What is the attraction?
**Answer:** 3 of Swords. With this card we see jealousy and problems, and a potential love triangle. Is this romantic attraction a married person, and does Larry enjoy being involved in a relationship he cannot have? Larry must like controversy, but it can lead to serious confrontations and even injury.

**Question 2:** Is this person loving?
**Answer:** King of Pentacles. This individual is independent, loving, financially astute, and stubborn. She is not a dependent female but an experienced business person, good with money, and successful. She likes to help others in many different ways.

**Question 3:** Can we have fun together?
**Answer:** Ace of Wands (Reversed). At this time Larry is not happy because he does not have much free time to go on trips, begin new projects, or institute new experiences. This is not the time to make new plans for relationships. He needs to focus on work primarily and let his social life rest. If Larry can be light-hearted about this affair then fun can be had with no harm to either party!

**Question 4:** Can we work together and support each other?
**Answer:** 8 of Swords. Larry has the strength to cope with this situation, but it may cause more problems than it is worth. He is on unsafe ground and does not want to recognize the danger. Larry should meditate and go within for answers to his questions. He must make his own decisions regarding this relationship.

**Question 5:** Will there be sexual compatibility?
**Answer:** 7 of Wands. As long as Larry relies on his mental capacities he can have success no matter what he does. Whether in business or socially, Larry must use his own judgment and express his own ego and willpower. He can have compatibility if that is his desire. Question 2 spoke of the other person as being loving although not dependent. Sex will be a problem if love is missing on Larry's part.

**Question 6:** Will our families get along?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles. If Larry is interested in schooling, has a career focus, or the potential to reach the top of his profession, he will be acceptable to the family of his romantic attraction. He must be ambitious, traditional, and a good provider with a positive attitude about making money. He is not yet sure about this relationship, but the questions still pester him.

**Question 7:** Are there religious differences?
**Answer:** 6 of Pentacles. This card indicates that Larry must make some kind of choice regarding finances, being fair, and sharing resources. There could be religious differences between Larry and his love and they must both make adjustments.

**Question 8:** Will we have problems with power and money?
**Answer:** Lovers (Reversed). This card shows Larry has a lack of trust in himself and problems involved with commitment or little self-confidence. Larry is apprehensive about making decisions—perhaps he fears making wrong ones. It appears that problems with power and money could lead to alienation. Honesty and trust are essential ingredients in any relationship.

**Question 9:** Is this a long-term relationship?
**Answer:** Page of Wands. This Page is eager to experience work and social life. Either Larry or the object of his romantic attraction desire freedom; both are headstrong and independent. They both wish to travel, study foreign cultures, and enjoy life. This relationship may be short and sweet or become a long-term affair that is on and off again and again.

# Question 10: What is the outcome?
**Answer:** 5 of Pentacles. This card indicates that either Larry or his romantic interest may get bogged down with too much work soon. Larry treats money as a god, which is not a healthy attitude and can cripple a person through negative beliefs. This card shows poverty-mindedness without any trust in an inner source. Perhaps neither Larry nor his love feel as supported as they wish to be. The potential for drug use is indicated.

**Comment:** Any relationship can work if there is love, trust, and a desire to be together. There seems to be many difficulties to overcome in this relationship but with perseverance, it can work out. If she is available, then Larry has a good chance to win the hand of the fair lady. If he cares, nothing will stand in his way!

8th position 10 of Wands (Reversed)
9th position Ace of Cups
10th position 4 of Cups (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** Does my lover care for me?
**Answer:** Temperance. Doris must balance her emotional needs and have patience during this difficult period of her life. Temperance shows fire, which is action and energy. She needs to slow down and enjoy her life, which is not easy for a fire sign (she is a Leo). Doris' lover cares for her, but is not ready to commit to a lasting relationship.

**Question 2:** Are we compatible?
**Answer:** Wheel of Fortune (Reversed). There are no changes in Doris' relationship. She should not gamble or take any risks with her lover, instead just go with the flow. Doris desires to be admired and loved, and her lover gives her what she needs when they are together.

**Question 3:** Do we have similar desires and goals?
**Answer:** Page of Cups. Both Doris and her lover are 48 How to Use Tarot Spreads very sensitive, creative, and have psychic ability. This Page can bring good news regarding love relationships, parties, births, and marriages (not necessarily one's own). The card can indicate that both Doris and her lover are immature, illusory, and possibly troubled with liquor or drug problems. Their goals may not coincide.

**Question 4:** Is my lover faithful and true?
Answer: Fool. Doris' lover wants adventure, new experiences, and being out and about. Since there is no commitment, her lover is free to do as he pleases.

**Question 5:** Are we attracted to each other sexually only?
Answer: Knight of Wands. The Knight brings information concerning work and social activities. There are plans for a trip or change of residence. Doris is trying to do both—she is buying a condo and travels for her job. These activities do not give her much time to indulge in building a future for herself and her lover.

**Question 6:** Will my lover consider marriage?
Answer: High Priestess (Reversed). Doris does not think so. She feels he has a closed mind, fears commitment, and lacks self-confidence. He may not want an overly intelligent female in his life.

**Question 7:** Does my lover have high standards and good values?
Answer: Hierophant (Reversed). Doris thinks her lover is a pleasure seeker, indulgent, and materialistic. He enjoys sexual pleasures and being with Doris but does not seem to want a closer relationship. The Hierophant reversed shows a rebellious person who does not abide by the rules. If his standards and values are not high, Doris must re-evaluate this relationship.

**Question 8:** Can we share our finances and material possessions?
**Answer:** 10 of Wands (Reversed). Doris feels burdened at this time with her own needs, including trying to buy a condo for herself. She may not be keen on sharing her resources without a show of good faith from her lover.

**Question 9:** Will my lover stay with me or leave?
**Answer:** Ace of Cups. This card tells Doris that she will have new beginnings in her love life. She will have a new residence within the year, happiness and pleasure will follow! This card also relates to new emotional involvements. Perhaps this lover will depart from Doris' life?

**Question 10:** What is the final outcome?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups (Reversed). Doris is not realizing how she feels emotionally. She is disappointed in her love relationship; she has great expectations but fears commitment or rejection. She has been married and divorced and does not wish to repeat the experience.

**Comment:** With all the reversed cards in this spread, it does not seem likely that this relationship will continue and result in marriage. This agrees with Doris' thinking, but that can change in an instant—perhaps her real love is waiting in the wings? Since this reading, Doris has moved to Australia with a new love!

**Answer:** 8 of Wands. Suzanne has the strength to work and have social activities. She can overcome any problems if she desires.

### READING
**Question 1:** Will I ever find my true love?
**Answer:** High Priestess (Reversed). Denis says he does not know the meaning of life or how to make a good relationship. He has a closed mind and fixed attitude. His parents were divorced when he was very young and now he fears a commitment. Denis could be too critical or over-analytical in his relations with others. True love sees only perfection in the loved one!

**Question 2:** Will I feel safe and secure with this person?
**Answer:** Sun (Reversed). Denis will feel safe and secure with anyone if he feels that way about himself. He lacks courage and may have low self-esteem, which does not help his needs. Denis must learn to accept himself first. He is a handsome young man and must have confidence in himself, be open and honest, and not fear rejection. Reversed, this card speaks of little ego and less energy—something that can be overcome.

**Question 3:** Is marriage a potential for me?
**Answer:** 3 of Pentacles. The 3 of Pentacles refers to the master craftsman—a person successful in their chosen field and very creative. Denis makes money because he is good in his work. His talents will eventually bring him rich rewards, but he wants everything now. This card indicates that Denis wants a partner who has creative talents and can make money. Marriage is more than a potential if he can find a female who supports herself and shares her resources with him.

**Question 4:** Will this new love be similar to my past lovers?
**Answer:** 9 of Cups (Reversed). Denis is a Scorpio and very intense regarding his desires, but if he lacks the wisdom of his experiences in love, then he is doomed to repeat his past. If he is not aware of his emotional drains, he will bring the same type of relationship into his life. Without new information or the refusal to evaluate past experiences, repeat performances are inevitable in every area of a person's life. It is time to change beliefs.

**Question 5:** Will commitment be possible with this new love?
**Answer:** 6 of Cups (Reversed). This card reversed warns to be careful, as someone is making decisions for you. If Denis is not making his own choices with this new love, he will feel trapped. There is a potential for this experience to be emotionally draining for Denis. Commitment is possible but is it practical?

**Question 6:** Can the magic last between us?
**Answer:** 7 of Pentacles. The path to magic is financial for Denis. His mental focus is on financial responsibilities and feeling secure—having money in the bank. Life is magic, but people tend to look for flaws, making the magic disappear. If Denis loves himself and accepts himself, he can make a wonderful relationship and the magic could last forever.

**Question 7:** What can I do to make this person part of my life?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles (Reversed). This Page is not interested in schooling, setting goals, or earning money. It indicates that Denis may want the easy life, preferring to not work too hard, and resenting authority figures. If Denis wants a lasting relationship he must make some changes in his thinking. By paying attention to his thinking and beliefs, he can change his life. Remember—what you believe, you manifest. This is true for everyone.

**Comment:** Denis has had several relationships but none lasting. His parents were divorced and his early conditioning did not give him a feeling of security. Denis is thirty and does not feel successful. He has returned to school (medical) since this reading and hopes to become a physician's assistant. He has also begun a new relationship. Three cheers for Denis!

## Magical Love for Adele

6th    position       Hierophant 
7th    position       Queen of Swords (Reversed) 

### READING
**Question 1:** Will I ever find my true love?
**Answer:** Hanged Man. Adele feels she has been sacrificed to the will and desires of others. She must learn to have faith in herself and stop living in fantasy. She will find true love after she learns to love herself. She must also learn to meditate.

**Question 2:** Will I feel safe and secure with this person?
**Answer:** 5 of Pentacles (Reversed). Adele has not made money her god. She is surrounded by ambitious family members and wishes to live her life differently. At seventeen, she may feel she needs to get a job and be independent. If Adele enters a relationship, she will accept this person on her terms, not based on what others want her to do. Adele is beginning to have faith in her own talents and also herself. Feeling secure must come from within oneself. She is a Leo with a mind of her own.

**Question 3:** Is marriage a potential for me?
**Answer:** Ace of Wands. Marriage is always a potential for anyone who desires it. Adele is slated to have new beginnings in work and socially. There will be new contacts for her and perhaps some new opportunities. Adele's parents are divorced and both have remarried. She may crave excitement and bring someone new into her life, but love and marriage may take time.

**Question 4:** Will this new love be similar to my past lovers?
**Answer:** 10 of Pentacles. Adele remarked that she was too young to have had a past lover. She is waiting to see the type of relationship she will attract. This card indicates a change of fortune and foretells better times ahead for her.

**Question 5:** Will commitment be possible with this new love?
**Answer:** Ace of Pentacles (Reversed). The potential of this first relationship ending in commitment is not likely. The card signifies that Adele must conserve her resources during this period. Perhaps her first love will not have resources of his own and must finish school before accepting a commitment.

**Question 6:** Can the magic last between us?
**Answer:** Hierophant. This card indicates Adele is looking for a teacher. At this time, Adele should seek an inner teacher and meditate—going within herself to find answers to her problems. Her beliefs may be creating negative experiences in her life. She longs for approval and resents authority. The magic can last if she is not criticized in this relationship.

**Question 7:** What can I do to make this person part of my life?
**Answer:** Queen of Swords (Reversed). Adele's mother is a Libra and so is this card. Adele's mother has had a dramatic effect on her. Mom is successful and works hard. Adele has two sisters and sibling rivalry may be part of the problem. Adele has lived with her dad and stepmother the last few years and is not very happy with this arrangement. The Queen of Swords reversed shows that the person does not wish to be alone, they prefer to be in relationships. At this point, Adele must meet someone before she needs to worry about how to make them a part of her life. She does not want to stay single for long even though she is only seventeen.

**Comment:** Adele insisted on doing this particular reading. She is not involved with anyone but seems to be in a hurry to find someone who will love her and rescue her from her family. She has had a rough childhood and had problems as a teenager. Time will tell whether she changes her thinking and beliefs and decides to have a good life in spite of her past experiences. As of early 1997, Adele has an apartment with a female roommate. She works and goes to college. She's a non-conformist, through dress, no hair, and rings in her ears, nose and tongue.

## Magical Love for Julie

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD

3rd  position High Priestess 
4th  position 5 of Pentacles 
5th  position 7 of Pentacles 
6th  position King of Swords 
7th  position Queen of Pentacles

### READING
**Question 1:** Will I ever find my true love?
**Answer:** Page of Wands. Julie is a Sagittarius and this card is her. She is a freedom lover, loves new experiences, is independent, and desires to travel. Perhaps Julie does not want a permanent relationship due to her need for freedom. She disclosed her desire to find a younger man and I agreed with her.

**Question 2:** Will I feel safe and secure with this person?
**Answer:** The World (Reversed). No. The financial picture does not look promising. Julie will not feel supported and this will create problems.

**Question 3:** Is marriage a potential for me?
**Answer:** High Priestess. The High Priestess says Julie is intelligent and has the answers within herself. She will know whether a relationship is right.

**Question 4:** Will this new love be similar to my past lovers?
**Answer: 5 of Pentacles.** The 5 of Pentacles infers the lover desires money and may be into liquor or drugs. She feels this person is crippled in some way which may relate to financial aspirations. The belief in money rather than faith in the self is not positive. Julie must ask herself if past relationships had money problems.

**Question 5:** Will commitment be possible with this new lover?
**Answer: 7 of Pentacles.** The 7 of Pentacles reveals Julie's desire to be in charge of her own money and its dispersal. She works for her money and does not want anyone to tell her what to do with it. She has her own financial path. The seven does not indicate commitment unless it is on Julie's terms.

**Question 6:** Can the magic last between us?
**Answer: King of Swords.** This card may refer to legal proceedings or her lover (Gemini). Julie desires a partner with career potential and intelligence. The magic seems to be in the finances rather than in love. A prenuptial agreement can remove the magic.

**Question 7:** What can I do to make this person a part of my life?
**Answer: Queen of Pentacles.** With the Queen of Pentacles, sex and money seem to be the solution. This is the card of pregnant money or a child. Julie feels if she has more money, she will attract a lover, but she doesn't want to share resources or be dependent. This is a dilemma!

**Comment:** Look at your dependency needs. Learn to trust yourself and decide to have a happy life.

## Family Problems for Tom

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD

3rd position World
4th position 7 of Swords
5th position 9 of Wands
6th position 8 of Swords
7th position 8 of Cups (Reversed)
8th position 6 of Wands (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** Who is primarily involved with the problem?
**Answer:** 10 of Wands (Reversed). Tom feels he is carrying heavy burdens at work and socially. All the people involved are family and Tom thinks he is trapped in the situation. He does not see any possibility for changes at the present time. He spoke of the obstacles to any plans that are frustrating him.

**Question 2:** What is the conflict regarding your security or safety?
**Answer:** 9 of Pentacles (Reversed). Tom is realizing his lack of wisdom in money matters. He does not think the family backs him in his decisions but feels dependent now that his money is tied up in the family business.

**Question 3:** How is dysfunctional behavior an issue in the problem?
**Answer:** World.** One member of the family has back problems, which is creating emotional turmoil, and another is not carrying a fair share of the responsibilities, according to Tom. But with the World card here, it is indicated that success in all endeavors will be the outcome. Tom has support from his inner resources and can maintain balance through any crisis.

**Question 4:** Has this person had similar problems in the past?
**Answer:** 7 of Swords. Tom remarked that problems are part of the picture. The individual with back problems has had them before, and the other person was not interested in tying himself down to work. The situation may be temporary and can change quickly. Tom feels cheated or that others are stealing from him.

**Question 5:** What steps must be taken to resolve this matter?
**Answer:** 9 of Wands. Tom needs to use wisdom at work and socially. Tom must use fair tactics and achieve his goals through intelligence while learning to protect himself and his interests at work and socially.

**Question 6:** Are there situations you should avoid?
**Answer:** 8 of Swords. There is no way for Tom to avoid his problems. He feels in bondage and on unsafe ground, but he will get his footing soon. Fortunately he has the strength to cope with his situation and should look within for answers. Tom must maintain his health in order to keep the business flourishing.

**Question 7:** What effect do these problems have on your health?
**Answer:** 8 of Cups (Reversed). Tom cannot leave this situation. At this time, he feels all right but the emotional drain will have an effect eventually.

**Question 8:** What are the end results?
**Answer:** 6 of Wands (Reversed). Tom must take care not to make unwise choices due to his frustrations. Avoiding setbacks by taking right actions is important, and negative use of energy will create worse problems. Tom should be prepared for delays and frustrations until he can set new moves in motion.

**Comment:** It is difficult to separate a family involved with business—everyone must share the blame when problems arise. In this case, the family issues are tied to a business in which these people are involved. Matters have become so intense that the health of at least one member and the emotional body of another have been affected. The only solution is to "wait and see" what will happen, otherwise the financial aspect of the business will suffer and everyone will lose.

## Family Problems for Gerry

7th position 8 of Cups (Reversed)
8th position 6 of Wands (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** Who is primarily involved with the problem?
**Answer:** 7 of Cups (Reversed). Gerry feels negative because her love and emotional needs are not being fulfilled. She is not using her abilities for creative visualization, which might help her get over this negativity. There is a potential for drugs or liquor that could be part of the problem in the family.

**Question 2:** What is the conflict regarding your security or safety?
**Answer:** The Fool (Reversed). Gerry does not want to do anything foolish, but she is anxious about her financial status and her health. Staying in a negative situation is not usually positive.

**Question 3:** How is dysfunctional behavior an issue in the problem?
**Answer:** 9 of Cups. This is the wish card and when it is up, it means the person will get their wish. Gerry was pleased to hear this. Gerry is gaining wisdom through her experiences, and this can help her in future relationships. She is also gaining confidence in her emotional life. If drugs or liquor are involved, she will know how to handle the experience without feeling like a victim. As they say, "experience is the best teacher."

**Question 4:** Has this person had similar problems in the past?
**Answer:** King of Pentacles (Reversed). This King indicates someone who is lazy, selfish, a speculator, and impractical with money. This person may be dishonest and can use shady business practices. Gerry sees this individual in her family as sensual, loving luxury, and desiring pleasure. This person is not willing to share resources, and Gerry feels unloved. This individual will not change and Gerry must make her own decisions about what is best for her.

**Question 5:** What steps must be taken to resolve this matter?
**Answer:** Ace of Cups (Reversed). Gerry does not see any new beginnings in her life at this time. She is having an emotional drain and her love is turning into bitterness. Gerry will soon need to make some decisions, discuss the matter openly with this individual, or leave. Confrontation is sometimes the only way to resolve a situation.

**Question 6:** Are there situations you should avoid?
**Answer:** Knight of Swords (Reversed). This Knight carries news of problems and troubles. This message, which is an unreliable source of information, may or may not concern Gerry. She must avoid becoming depressed or feeling like a victim. She can always make a decision to leave the situation and go out on her own, away from the family. The ties that bind can be severed!

**Question 7:** What effect do these problems have on your health?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles. This Page refers to the student. By going to school and getting a better education, Gerry's life can improve and her health will be good. Now is the time for a change in focus to something positive, which will also keep her healthy.

**Question 8:** What are the end results?
**Answer:** 2 of Wands (Reversed). Gerry does not have enough confidence in herself. She needs more education—she feels she doesn't know her work or her place in society. Gerry is afraid of failure and perhaps needs to return to her family, but she does not want that to happen. This indicated that Gerry has a closed mind, is critical, and has little ambition.

**Comment:** Looking at the cards in this spread and seeing that six cards are reversed lets the reader understand that the person has a negative outlook on life. There is fear and guilt within this mind, which causes Gerry to be overly cautious in her actions. Lack of self-confidence and an inferiority complex are playing large parts in her life, as well. The big question is "when will Gerry learn to enjoy life and be happy?" Perhaps the reading will give her some insight into her thinking and she will change her life.

**Answer:** 3 of Pentacles. This is the card of the master craftsman who makes money because he is good at what he does. Think about your worth when it comes to earning money and don't be swayed. The number 3 refers to creative visualization, which can be used to overcome any problem or fear.

**Question 3:** Will I ever be happy?
**Answer:** Judgment. It will be up to Cory to make himself happy. Awareness and understanding must be used, and being in touch with the inner self is important. As Cory put it, "Arise and come from the grave of ignorance."

**Question 4: Past feelings of guilt and resentment?**
**Answer:** 9 of Wands (Reversed). Cory says he did not use wisdom through his experience at work and is now suing his boss for wrongful termination. The allegations have created some health problems for Cory, but nothing long-lasting. He did not protect himself at work with his employers, and there was a great deal of jealousy with the other staff. Cory had many steady customers who appreciated his dedication to service.

**Question 5: Past feelings of depression or unhappiness?**
**Answer:** The Devil (Reversed). Cory is not willing to chain himself to the devil for materialistic gain. Cory has been in spiritual work most of his life and when negative experiences happen he is shocked. He has become unhappy due to his character being maligned. Some of his friends have depressed him also. Crisis periods can relieve boredom and Cory needed a change whether he was aware of it or not.

**Question 6: Past health problems?**
**Answer:** High Priestess. The High Priestess knows all about health and everything else. Cory has good health with no history of major illness. Because he believes in health as a natural outcome of life, he does not bring negative thoughts about health into his life.

**Question 7: Do I need formal medical attention?**
**Answer:** 8 of Cups (Reversed). When Cory doesn't have the strength to turn his back on an emotional situation, he takes an aspirin. He told me during the reading that he drinks lightly to combat an over-abundance of sensitive feelings. He is very open psychically and tends to "pick up" on other people's thoughts. He claims that meditation helps him overcome negativity around him.

**Question 8:** Will my physical health affect my financial health?
**Answer:** Ace of Cups (Reversed). This card shows an emotional drain and no new beginnings. Cory does not like inactivity! He will initiate new experiences, including financial ones, through his will. Being spiritually aware, Cory knows only "wellness" and is focused on this attitude.

**Question 9:** Will spiritual awareness aid in overcoming any health problem?
**Answer:** Queen of Wands (Reversed). Cory has a need for ego-recognition and wants attention. He is an Aquarian and this is a Leo card. (These signs are the opposites of each other.) His spiritual understanding keeps him from going overboard in his desires and his attitude keeps his health problems to a minimum.

**Question 10:** Outcome?
**Answer:** The Star. Cory must set new goals and "hitch his wagon to a star." He should raise his expectations to create a healthy environment. There is a potential for new directions in Cory's life.

**Comment:** If Cory continues his spiritual inclinations he will stay healthy. The trial is over and he won! He is going to school for retraining in a new direction.

## Health Spread for Lacie

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st position 10 of Cups
2nd position Ace of Swords (Reversed)
3rd position 3 of Cups (Reversed)
4th position Temperance (Reversed)
5th position Death (Reversed)
6th position 4 of Pentacles (Reversed)
7th position Lovers
8th position 5 of Swords
9th position 4 of Swords (Reversed)
10th position 7 of Swords (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** Should I worry about my health?
**Answer:** 10 of Cups. Lacie will have major changes in her life regarding love and emotions. She could have joy in the home and with her family. Lacie needs back surgery again (Sword and Pentacle cards can indicate health problems and potential operations). Worry does not solve anything, having faith does.

**Question 2:** How do I overcome my fears?
**Answer:** Ace of Swords (Reversed). This card indicates no new beginnings in problems because the old ones are not finished. Lacie has had two back surgeries on the same disc and now needs a third, which is dangerous. Any back problems indicate a lack of support. Lacie is a Capricorn and a very determined person. The way to overcome fear is to have faith in one's inner source.

## Question 3: Will I ever be happy?
**Answer:** 3 of Cups (Reversed). This card shows Lacie does not make herself happy. She is having problems in her relationships, which is creating an emotional drain with the potential for depression and loneliness. Lacie and her husband spend too much time in their business and do not have much time for a social life.

## Question 4: Past feelings of guilt and resentment?
**Answer:** Temperance. Lacie is self-indulgent, restless, and lacking patience. Her desires can lead to waste, loss, or misfortune at this time. Lacie is having back surgery soon and her negative attitude has resulted from past feelings of guilt and resentment.

## Question 5: Past feelings of depression or unhappiness?
**Answer:** Death (Reversed). Lacie is in her sixties and has four children of her own and three children from her second marriage. She has had many years of experience, some not so happy and others quite depressing. By holding on to these negative experiences a person has the tendency to repeat them. If Lacie has a materialistic focus, which is natural to Capricorns, she must decide when she feels secure enough to relax and be happy. Lacie's back problems, which indicate a lack of support from those around her, started in her past and have again recently manifested.

## Question 6: Past health problems?
**Answer:** 4 of Pentacles (Reversed). Lacie has had other medical problems and visited the doctor quite frequently. This card indicates a potential to have health problems due to financial matters, but money problems have not always been the cause of her health afflictions. Lacie has a tendency to have fixed ideas and she is very traditional and does not realize that she is responsible for her condition.

## Question 7: Do I need formal medical attention?
**Answer:** Lovers. This card refers to choices that must be made regarding health matters. She has decided to have a third operation on her back to relieve the pain. Lacie refuses to listen to any alternative suggestions and she must take the responsibility for her actions.

## Question 8: Will my physical health affect my financial health?
**Answer:** 5 of Swords. At this time, Lacie does not have a healthy attitude. She meets the public every day and must wear a happy face. Lacie is in constant pain and this is affecting her adversely. She has had a pleasant demeanor with customers, but that is difficult to maintain with health problems. Lacie's financial affairs will be affected if her operation keeps her bedridden for any length of time. Her husband will need other people to help run their business, which will cut into their profits.

**Question 9:** Will spiritual awareness aid in overcoming any health problems?
**Answer:** 4 of Swords (Reversed). This card indicates that Lacie does not realize her problems and troubles. She is burning the candle at both ends. Lacie and her husband say they cannot find good help. Neither of them is interested in spiritual responsibility or information that could change their lives.

**Question 10:** Outcome?
**Answer:** 7 of Swords (Reversed). This card reveals that there will be no victory regarding Lacie's problems. The situation is stagnant, and there is potential for jealousy and a lack of love and harmony. Lacie feels she is in an unhappy relationship that may never end. The path she is taking is material, which shows a lack of faith in her inner source. Lacie should re-evaluate her situation and seek answers she may have overlooked. Peace and happiness can happen!

**Comment:** This situation between Lacie, her son, and her husband must be resolved in order for her health to improve. Lacie and her husband must spend less time working and more time playing. When they straighten out their finances and the time they spend at work, life could be beautiful!

## A Thief in the Home for Stephen

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st    position      2 of Wands

3rd    position      Chariot

7th    position      3 of Cups 
8th    position      8 of Wa nds (Reversed) 

### READING
**Question 1:** Why did I/we attract a thief into the home?
**Answer:** 2 of Wands. Stephen knows his work and social life. He has the world in his hands and has worked hard to attain this position, but he may fear that he does not deserve all the good coming his way.

**Question 2:** Is this thief related to me or my spouse?
**Answer:** 6 of Cups. Stephen thinks the thief is someone he knows and may be distantly related to his wife. This card can indicate someone returning from the past, which could be a relative. He gave this person a key to their home, which was an irresponsible action. Stephen and his wife need to be more discriminating and responsible in the future.

**Question 3:** Is it possible the thief will return?
**Answer:** Chariot. This card indicates victory and by controlling desires and guiding himself mentally, Stephen will be successful. Stephen must meditate and turn to his Higher Self to find out why he attracted the thief in the first place. This can bring positive results to overcome negative experiences.

**Question 4:** Would an alarm system help in the future?
**Answer:** Knight of Pentacles. This Knight brings positive messages concerning money. If Stephen and his wife want to install an alarm system the finances will be available. If they continue to give keys away, the alarm system will be useless.

**Question 5:** What can I/we do now to change the feelings in the home?
**Answer:** Queen of Swords. This card refers to problems and often indicates a divorced or widowed woman. Stephen is married to a divorced woman and she is now pregnant with their first child. They both feel violated by this thief and are trying to decide what to do. Perhaps the marriage is not as smooth as it should be and both partners are feeling pressured. It is time to evaluate their feelings and be honest with each other.

**Question 6:** What responsibilities did I/we overlook?
**Answer:** Sun. Stephen needs confidence in his abilities to make life work out. He must be open to new thoughts and have the courage to carry through. Stephen must seek truth, use his creative talents, and bring success into his life now.

**Question 7:** What did I/we learn from this experience?
**Answer:** 3 of Cups. This card refers to pregnancy, a celebration, and good use of creative talents. Stephen has the desire to be happy and enjoy his marriage while he awaits the arrival of his first child. His emotions are positive and he loves his wife. The lesson is learning to think positively and be responsible.

**Question 8:** The outcome?
**Answer:** 8 of Wands (Reversed). Stephen lacks strength socially or in his work and feels that the delays and setbacks in his life are keeping him from success. Stephen felt insecure and his thinking was not balanced. He was focused on one person being responsible and was not interested in hearing about the possibility of anyone else being the thief.

**Comment:** Unfortunately, Stephen has been robbed again since this reading. He is a healer and has worked very hard to be successful in his career. He is in his forties and married for the first time—something he did not expect to happen. As a bonus, they recently had a son. Stephen's life has changed dramatically in less than a year and he now has new responsibilities that may have been overwhelming for him. Stephen will make it through with flying colors if he gives himself the opportunity.

## Business Spread for Sam

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st position Queen of Pentacles
2nd position Queen of Wands
3rd position Page of Swords (Reversed)
4th position 9 of Cups
5th position Hermit
6th position 7 of Pentacles (Reversed)
7th position King of Wands (Reversed)
8th position 2 of Cups
9th position Page of Pentacles
10th position The Fool (Reversed)

## READING
**Question 1:** Should I begin my own business?
**Answer:** Queen of Pentacles. This card is involved with making money and being critical or judgmental. Sam has started his own business, which has been time consuming and demanding. It has already created a health problem for him that he fortunately has overcome.

**Question 2:** Should the business be a partnership?
**Answer:** Queen of Wands. Sam has two partners and is not comfortable in this position. One partner might have been fine, but not two. Sam is ambitious and he is seeking success at work and in his social life. His ego needs are involved with this business and he wants admiration and attention.


**Question 3:** Will the public be receptive to my product?
**Answer:** Page of Swords (Reversed). This card indicates that Sam does not pay attention to his problems. The public has been receptive to their products and the business is doing well. Sam is anxious and wants success but seems to neglect his personal life.

**Question 4:** Will the work be difficult?

**Answer:** 9 of Cups. This is the wish card and when upright in a spread says "Your wish is granted." Sam has enough confidence in his work and is able to put in long hours periodically. There are other people in the business who work full- and part-time. The work itself is not difficult.

**Question 5:** Are there changes I need to make now?
**Answer:** The Hermit. Sam owned a business for thirty years, but not in the same field. He has gathered wisdom through that experience and can apply some of that knowledge to his new venture. The partners are enlarging the store to accommodate more customers, so the changes are being made now. Sam is an Aries, and they usually have good ideas, but they don't always stay for the finish.

**Question 6:** Are there responsibilities I have overlooked?
**Answer:** 7 of Pentacles (Reversed). This card refers to an uncertain path to money. The number 7 can pertain to legal matters, as well. Through a lack of confidence or feeling little support, this business could suffer. Sam must accept responsibility, but he must also share with the other partners. There can be pettiness and jealousy among the partners now.

**Question 7:** Will I be successful?
**Answer:** King of Wands (Reversed). This King is an Aries, as is Sam. If he is being childish, selfish, domineering, and a petty tyrant then the other partners will work against him. Having relationship problems or being overbearing and unyielding will not bring success; working together for the common good will.

**Question 8:** Will I make money through this business?
**Answer:** 2 of Cups. Sam knows about his emotions and his ability to love. He understands that a good relationship is healthy. With this knowledge and application, the business, which has shown its potential in the last few years, could prosper.

**Question 9:** What method of advertising should I use?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles. This Page is a Capricorn—the student who goes to school to learn about a career. Capricorn and Aries (Sam) can work well together. Earth and fire. The fire takes action and Earth stays to clean up. Capricorn is financially focused and Aries, as a rule, has great ideas about making money. Sending messages out to schools or places where there are young people is one method. Putting out flyers is another. Hiring young people to work with the customers is a third possibility. Trying different methods to see which works is the solution.

**Question 10:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** The Fool (Reversed). This card refers to balance. Sam must balance his pleasures, sexual needs, and any other desires. He must curb his anxieties, have faith in the future, act maturely, and be responsible if he wants his business to succeed. Sam fears being made a fool of, which keeps him unsettled.

**Comment:** Sam's business is doing very well. The problems seem to stem from relationships. If these three partners do not resolve these issues then chances of success are limited. Life is about people living and working together in harmony. Let's hope these three learn this lesson soon.

### READING
**Question 1:** Should I begin my own business?
**Answer:** 5 of Cups. Don believes in love but his love is not based in truth. There is the potential for his relationship to suffer due to the strain in his business. Don started his own business several years ago and he spends long hours at his work. He is not sure about keeping the business if it costs him his marriage.

**Question 2:** Should the business be a partnership?
**Answer:** 10 of Wands. Perhaps if Don had a partner he could share the burdens at work. With this card there will be major changes in Don's life, which could include new business methods or new opportunities. Don's social life may also become active.

**Question 3:** Will the public be receptive to my product?
**Answer:** 5 of Wands. Don believes in his work, but his ego may cause some problems. He wants his own way and if he decides to take a partner there could be conflicts of will and ego. Don has good products and is proud of his business.

**Question 4:** Will the work be difficult?
**Answer:** The Tower. Don must overthrow his false ideas and get rid of his old habit patterns. The work is not difficult at this time, but with the additions Don wants to make it could become so. This would create more strife and discord in his relationship at home and with the rest of his family.

**Question 5:** Are there changes I need to make now?
**Answer:** The World. Don would be wise to understand that there is success and attainment in all of his endeavors. If Don knew that he was being supported by his inner source he could relax and allow himself to enjoy the fruits of his labor now. The changes he needs to make: to have more faith in himself, become more balanced, and trust his ability to succeed.

**Question 6:** Are there responsibilities I have overlooked?
**Answer:** The Star. The Star card speaks of goals for the future. Perhaps Don needs to set new goals, accept new opportunities, and be optimistic about the future. There are also relationship obligations that must be taken into account. Success at the cost of relationships is not a positive attitude.

**Question 7:** Will I be successful?
**Answer:** Judgment. Don has the potential to be very successful. With new understanding comes more self-confidence. Don's health will improve with awareness of his potential. He may move his residence, take a trip, or just learn to relax. Accepting our inner source and realizing that there is always help will bring joy and happiness into our lives.

**Question 8:** Will I make money through this business?
**Answer:** Wheel of Fortune. Now is the time for Don to take a chance, be a gambler, make changes, seek new experiences, and enjoy the family and other relationships. Don must be positive during this period and he will stay healthy and make money.

**Question 9:** What method of advertising should I use?
**Answer:** 7 of Wands. This card indicates that Don should rely on his own judgment. He wants to express his ego at work or in social events. Don would prefer a magazine for his ads as well as hand-bills carried to individuals. Don must trust his own choices in this matter.

**Question 10:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** 9 of Wands (Reversed). Don must have more confidence in the business and himself. There could be abuse from outside sources, or even from family. Don may be encountering jealousy and negative feelings from those around him.

**Comment:** Success is there, but Don must feel he deserves it.

### READING
**Question 1:** Is the career I have chosen what I really want?
**Answer:** The Chariot. The path Janice took in her career was her choice. She mentally guided herself in the direction of her choice. Janice enjoys her work.

**Question 2:** What steps can I take to improve my career?
**Answer:** 5 of Swords. Janice realizes her problems and troubles and is continually bringing more of the same into her life, especially at work. She needs to control her speech and temper for better results. Others may find her aggressive manner difficult to deal with. Janice must learn to balance her ego needs with patience and understanding.

**Question 3:** Are there aspects to my career I cannot change?
**Answer:** The Moon. This card indicates progress and attainment cycles. Janice may be living in fantasy and illusion, and her emotions are on overdrive. When an individual works for the government, as Janice does, they are not able to make career changes on a whim, tests must be taken and movement is only possible if positions become open.

**Question 4:** Do I feel I am doing my best in my career?
**Answer:** Knight of Cups. Messages of love are coming to Janice that indicate she is doing a good job. She has fifty people working for her in her department and most of them feel she is a good boss and considerate. If she is insecure about doing her best in her job, it is her problem.

**Question 5:** What changes can I make personally that will help my career?
**Answer:** 9 of Cups (Reversed). Janice has many wishes concerning her job, but they will not materialize at this time. There is also a lack of wisdom in love which affects her emotional state. Janice needs more faith in herself in dealing with other people. It would be wise of her to love and accept others and herself.

**Question 6:** What blocks in my past are affecting my career now?
**Answer:** The High Priestess (Reversed). This card reversed reveals a closed mind and a fear of new information. Janice may not want to know truth, anything about the future, or information regarding herself. She can be stubborn, superficial, and opinionated. Janice did not feel supported by her parents when she was a child and she set out to prove to them that she could be successful—and she is. Her parents are both deceased, but old habit patterns are hard to break. This card, when it appears in a spread for a female, may indicate a need to accept the dependent side of her own nature to create a balance within.

# Question 7: Outcome?
**Answer:** The Emperor. The Emperor is dressed for war, but he is sitting passively. He realizes that he can always fight, but he is going to think before he makes any decisions. This is good advice for Janice. Janice is a mature woman with grown children and she has experienced life. Maturity comes through experience and then applying the knowledge you've gained. The marketplace is usually run by the male population and this is true in Janice's case. For Janice, change will occur only if the boss gets transferred or dies. Janice must enjoy her life and be proud of her position because she has come a long way!

**Comment:** Janice has done a great deal with her life. She raised her two children without help from her ex-husband, she finished her education while she worked. Now she has a good job as a CPA. She deserves to respect herself—she has mine!

## Career Spread for Harvey

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st position 4 of Wands
2nd position Judgment
3rd position Page of Swords
4th position High Priestess (Reversed)
5th position Magician (Reversed)
6th position Hanged Man
7th position 3 of Wands

### READING
**Question 1:** Is the career I have chosen what I really want?
**Answer:** 4 of Wands. This card indicates a fruitful life, marriage, and balance in work and social life. Being an Aries, Harvey does not enjoy being tied down in any one place for long. He feels his choices are not always fruitful or balanced. He has had many job changes in the last year and has not focused on future goals.

**Question 2:** What steps can I take to improve my career?
**Answer:** Judgment. Awareness and awakening to truth are both part of the Judgment card. Harvey should learn all he can about his work, then he will reap his rewards. Harvey is impatient, another Aries trait, and wants to experience everything now! He must pay attention to his inner self—understanding does not occur overnight.

**Question 3:** Are there aspects to my career I cannot change?
**Answer:** Page of Swords. This card indicates that Harvey will not pay attention to his own problems but will try to solve other people's difficulties. He can be a friend to the world—but at what cost? In order to make any changes in his life he must first work on himself. This Page suggests that Harvey is not as mature as he thinks. Perhaps being more responsible to his own needs will bring maturity. Change is as natural as breathing and will happen regardless of what a person thinks.

**Question 4:** Do I feel I am doing my best in my career?
**Answer:** The High Priestess (Reversed). This card infers that Harvey does not know if he is doing his best. He may not be open to new information, tending instead to be closed minded or prejudiced. The High Priestess reversed can indicate fear, guilt, and a refusal to go inside oneself to find truth. Harvey remarked that he felt he was going nowhere—with this attitude, Harvey is not doing his best work due to a lack of self-confidence or self-esteem.

**Question 5:** What changes can I make personally that will help my career?
**Answer:** The Magician (Reversed). Harvey feels that there are no new beginnings in any direction and he is frustrated. He would like to force the issue and, through his own will, make events take place. This is not positive at this time. Harvey desires a new job but must wait until something becomes available in his field. One major change he can make—to control his impulsiveness.

**Question 6:** What blocks in my past are affecting my career now?
**Answer:** The Hanged Man. The Hanged Man symbolizes the sacrificial lamb. There is a Neptunian attitude surrounding this card which could mean Harvey is into fantasy and illusion. He has old habit patterns he is still dealing with and may be into liquor or drugs, or feeling like a victim or martyr. Meditation—quieting the mind in order to see truth—would help him to get in touch with his blocks.

**Question 7:** Outcome?
**Answer:** 3 of Wands. This card is a sign that creative visualization might be an answer. It says "I make or create my work and social activities." Harvey wants a partner in his personal life but does not see this happening in the near future.

**Comment:** Creative visualization seems to be stressed in this reading and Harvey could benefit from this activity. It is difficult for an Aries person to sit for any length of time, but the rewards could be an incentive. The sooner Harvey gets involved with his own life, the better it will be for him. Since this reading, Harvey has had three different jobs, several girlfriends and has turned thirty.

7th     position       3 of Wands 

### READING
**Question 1:** Is the career I have chosen what I really want?
**Answer:** Strength (Reversed). Linda feels she is lacking the strength to overcome her difficulties. She may feel lazy, deny herself the good life, and have low self-esteem. Linda is not focused on a career and is in a job she does not like.

**Question 2:** What steps can I take to improve my career?
**Answer:** Knight of Pentacles (Reversed). Linda needs to look for a new job while she has her present one. She is waiting for news about money, which she will not receive. If messages do come, they will not contain news about money. The longer Linda waits, the more depressed she will become.

**Question 3:** Are there aspects to my career I cannot change?
**Answer:** 4 of Pentacles. Linda must realize her focus is on money, not her work. She should understand that when you do the work that you love, the money will follow.

**Question 4:** Do I feel I am doing my best in my career?
**Answer:** World (Reversed). This card shows no success or material gain at this time. Linda knows she is not doing her best at work. She lacks vision, fears change, is frustrated, and feels she doesn't get the support she craves. Linda is a Pisces, which shows illusion and fantasy as a part of her thinking. She is also overly emotional.

**Question 5:** What changes can I make personally that will help my career?
**Answer:** 9 of Wands. Linda has gained knowledge through experience in her work and social life. She also knows how to protect herself in both areas of her life. She must find a job she loves, use her intelligence, and not feel as though she must be on the defensive.

**Question 6:** What blocks in my past are affecting my career now?
**Answer:** High Priestess. Linda feels she knows the secrets of the universe. She desires a relationship to be supported, nurtured, and cared for. By discussing her early years as a child, Linda became nervous and upset. It was simple to point out to Linda that she was still laboring under past habit patterns. She has great expectations but she denies herself because she feels she doesn't deserve the best. Linda must forgive herself and others—this will change her life.

**Question 7:** Outcome?
**Answer:** 3 of Wands (Reversed). Linda thinks she doesn't make her own work or social life. She is lacking faith in her creative abilities and is not balanced. This card relates to creative visualization and Linda should have no trouble with this. She must make up her mind regarding her career and the direction she wishes to go. With creative visualization, she will reach her goals soon. However Linda must stay away from liquor or drugs, as Pisces are into fantasy and illusion from birth.

**Comment:** Linda appears to be love-starved. She has little faith or trust in relationships, which is also affecting her work. As a Pisces, she is extremely psychic but not using this talent for her own good. When she realizes that her past experiences and attitudes about them are creating obstacles, she can forgive herself and find success.

2nd position 4 of Cups
3rd position 3 of Wands (Reversed)
4th position Knight of Wands
5th position Sun (Reversed)
6th position 7 of Cups
7th position 2 of Wands (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** In what way are you concerned with your job?
**Answer:** 6 of Pentacles (Reversed). Lee has a fear of not earning enough money and is concerned that other people make her financial choices for her. She could be a spendthrift without realizing it.

**Question 2:** Is the conflict beyond your control?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups. Lee has been given a new position at work but she has not been told her new salary. Lee has put in a lot of extra time in the last month and was informed that she will not be paid for her efforts. She can't let this depress her and put her out of balance, causing an emotional drain and making her feel used. Unfortunately, there is nothing she can do about the situation.

**Question 3:** Should you communicate your feelings to your boss?
**Answer:** 3 of Wands (Reversed). Speaking to her boss would not be productive. Lee does not have faith in her own abilities and feels that she does not create her own reality. She must learn to creatively visualize what she desires in her life if she wants to change her situation.

**Question 4:** Is the work causing physical problems?
**Answer:** Knight of Wands. This Knight brings information concerning work and social activities. This Knight shows activity and energy—he is on the move. There is good news relating to work, planning a trip, or a change of residence. At this time Lee does not have any physical problems due to her job.

**Question 5:** Will there be changes in the job soon?
**Answer:** Sun (Reversed). Lee is a teacher and her school is on a year-round calendar. She is on vacation now and is traveling through northern California with her family. When she returns to work, she will have additional work to do as a mentor. She will need to allocate her time differently, creating changes in her daily schedule.

**Question 6:** Should you look for a new job?
**Answer:** 7 of Cups. This card refers to creative visualization. Lee must learn to have mental control over her emotions. She loves her students and refuses to contemplate leaving them. Lee understands that nothing stays the same forever, so she will bide her time and stay where she is. Lee is a Taurus, which is a sign of patience, and she has plenty of that!

**Question 7:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** 2 of Wands (Reversed). Lee does not wish to take action in her work or social life if she does not have all the answers. She knows that hasty decisions may not be in her best interest. She can be too critical of herself and her abilities—this trip is providing her with breathing space.

**Comments:** Lee has been a teacher for about ten years and loves what she does. She is a good teacher, bilingual and creative. She is also dedicated to her students. No matter where one works there are always problems and adjustments to be made. Lee needed to get away from all the turmoil going on at her school and this trip was ideal. Spending time with her husband and children will be good for everyone.

## Work Spread for Jeff

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD

lst     position      Star (Reversed) 
2nd     position       Queen of Pentacles 
3rd     position       5 of Swords 
4th     position      5 of Wands 
5th     position      High Priestess 
6th     position       6 of Wands (Reversed) 
7th     position       7 of Swords 

### READING
**Question 1:** In what way are you concerned with your job?
**Answer:** Star (Reversed). Jeff does not see any future in his job. He is the manager of his company, the highest position he can hold. Jeff must set new goals and use creative visualization to make progress in his life.

**Question 2:** Is the conflict beyond your control?
**Answer:** Queen of Pentacles. The owner of Jeff's company is very critical and judgmental. Jeff gets his share of abuse, but the owner gives it to all the help. The owner's wife tries to smooth things over and make life more bearable at work for all concerned. Jeff feels he is doing a good job and would like affirmation from his boss. Jeff has a choice—stay where he is or find another job.

**Question 3:** Should you communicate your feeling to your boss?
**Answer:** 5 of Swords (Reversed). Jeff does not believe in creating problems and troubles. He sees no change in the situation. His boss has his own ideas about running the business and Jeff must obey orders from him. Jeff claims he has tried talking to his boss, but to no avail.

**Question 4:** Is the work causing physical problems?
**Answer:** 5 of Wands. Yes. He is having problems with his right knee (the knee relates to career and social standing). Each employee is fighting for recognition at work, and socially he has ego needs that may not be met. Perhaps Jeff needs to evaluate his work situation and make other decisions.

**Question 5:** Will there be changes in the job soon?
**Answer:** High Priestess. Jeff said he did not know. Business has been up and down so much lately that he isn't sure. But the High Priestess says he does know. Does this mean that Jeff does not want to see because he might have to make a decision?

**Question 6:** Should you look for a new job?
**Answer:** 6 of Wands (Reversed). This card indicates that Jeff should not make a choice at this time or someone else will make his choice for him. Success is not possible at this time but the situation could change.

**Question 7:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** 7 of Swords. The 7 of Swords can show positive growth. It also means to have faith in your inner self and ask for guidance. The path Jeff is taking is a mental one, but it is also temporary. He feels cheated in some way or believes that something is being stolen from him. Maybe a new job would be more satisfying for Jeff.

**Comment:** Jeff feels he is not making progress toward his goal at this time and that he must wait for a better or more clear answer. This analysis may be right, but not if Jeff continues to have physical problems related to his work that are detrimental to his well-being.

## Work Spread for Joyce

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st position Queen of Swords
2nd position 2 of Wands
3rd position 9 of Wands (Reversed)
4th position 9 of Swords (Reversed)
5th position 6 of Pentacles

7th position Lovers

### READING
**Question 1:** In what way are you concerned with your job?
**Answer:** Queen of Swords. Joyce is a strong-willed woman and determined to make her business successful. She needs a back operation but feels the business is understaffed. Joyce works very hard and desires to be a winner.

**Question 2:** Is the conflict beyond your control?
**Answer:** 2 of Wands. Joyce knows what the conflict is in the work area and she has the control in her hands. Problems in the business have manifested a negative health situation for Joyce. She is one of three owners and each feels they know what is best for the business. Joyce must feel somewhat powerless with limited control for her back ailment to have flared up again. Back problems will occur when a person does not feel they are getting the support they deserve.

**Question 3:** Should you communicate your feelings to your boss?
**Answer:** 9 of Wands (Reversed). Joyce is not using the wisdom of her experiences in business and feels unprotected. There are two other owners to contend with and each has an ego that must be satisfied. The situation is not healthy and Joyce reflects that unhealthiness.

**Question 4:** Is the work causing physical problems?
**Answer:** 9 of Swords (Reversed). It is time to make changes now. Joyce's past experiences have not brought her wisdom or understanding and she is heading toward a crisis. Problems may become insurmountable, but the lessons must be learned. No time for rest and too many bosses are the factors involved in her physical problems. The work is not the culprit, but the mental strain Joyce is laboring under is the cause of her physical problems!

**Question 5:** Will there be changes in the job soon?
**Answer:** 6 of Pentacles. Joyce must have an operation on her back. While she is gone, at least two new employees must be hired to replace her. She will have to learn to be fair and share her resources with these new people. There will be changes and Joyce could visualize different ways to make money.

**Question 6:** Should you look for a new job?
**Answer:** Ace of Pentacles. Since Joyce owns a share of this business, she is not interested in a "job." One of her business partners is her husband and she must 128 How to Use Tarot Spreads understand that their relationship is based on financial security. They are enlarging their work place and this card indicates that this is a successful move. This card shows new beginnings in money and prosperity and speaks of better health for Joyce.

**Question 7: Final outcome?**
**Answer:** Lovers. Joyce must choose what to do with her life. She must use discrimination, be responsible, and have faith that she will make good decisions. Whatever Joyce decides, it will affect her husband and her own family. Removing herself from the combat zone will not solve the problems, only postpone them. She must decide.

**Comment:** The three bosses of this business are related to each other, and all of them seem to have short fuses. To help their relationship, it would be wise to sell the business. However, it seems this is not possible at this time although the problems are mounting. Getting more help, which would allow Joyce to spend less time working, may defuse the situation.

### READING
**Question 1: What is the problem?**
**Answer:** Queen of Pentacles (Reversed). Joanie is a spendthrift and would prefer not to work. She wants to be taken care of and has not found a person to lean on who will support her in the style she wishes.

**Question 2: The conflict?**
**Answer:** King of Wands. Joanie has many Aries traits. She wants everything now, to be independent and free. She is ambitious, with executive talents and leadership qualities. Her conflict is in bringing the same type of male into her life who wants her to take care of him and support him. This is very frustrating for her.

**Question 3: Did I create the problem?**
**Answer:** 7 of Wands (Reversed). Joanie has an inferiority complex and may feel incompetent. These attitudes can undermine any relationship. Joanie also has a physical and material focus which is not a sound basis for a good relationship. She does not drink, smoke, or indulge in drugs and will not tolerate anyone who does. Due to Joanie's ego needs, if she does not get attention she will end the affair. She understands that she creates her own reality but is determined to find that special person who will fulfill her dreams.

**Question 4:** Am I refusing to see my part of the problem?
**Answer:** 6 of Swords. Joanie has been tempted to run away from her problems but she understands that she must stay and face the music in order to advance in life. Joanie had problems with her father when she was a child, and this has colored all her relationships with men. She has begun reading self-help books and wants to realize her part in the situation.

**Question 5:** Past experiences with my partner?
**Answer:** 3 of Swords (Reversed). In the past, Joanie believed that she did not create her own problems. She was unhappily married and finally divorced her husband and has not had a long-term relationship since then. Joanie does not respect men due to her negative experiences with her dad.

**Question 6:** Are we abusive to each other?
**Answer:** The Hanged Man. Up to this point, Joanie feels that she has been sacrificed to the will of others. She feels in bondage, that no matter what the issue, she will not win. Fantasy and illusion cloud her reasoning and some of her ideas are without substance. Joanie wants something from her relationships but she must learn to let go—in this way she frees herself. No one can abuse her if she won't let them.

## Question 7: Are other people involved with our problem?
**Answer:** 6 of Wands (Reversed). Joanie has siblings and other relatives with whom she is involved. Her dad died recently and she is caught up in an inheritance battle. At this time she wants what she can get from her dad—it may finally resolve her negative feelings about her father and she can get on with her life.

## Question 8: Are there financial problems affecting our relationship?
**Answer:** 10 of Swords. For Joanie there will be big changes in her problems when she receives her inheritance. Many burdens will be lifted and some of her more serious problems will be taken care of. Joanie did not have pressing financial difficulties in her last relationship, but there were emotional ones that undermined it. A new cycle is beginning for her, which can affect her emotionally and bring happier times.

## Question 9: Will this relationship end?
**Answer:** Page of Wands. This Page desires freedom—so did Joanie. The relationship ended soon after the reading.

**Comment:** Joanie is studying spiritual work in earnest and is now more aware of her attitudes and how they worked against her past relationships. She vows to do things differently in the future.

**Answer:** 3 of Cups (Reversed). Ann feels she is having an emotional crisis. There is depression, unhappiness, and a lack of creativity in her life. She is also having problems in her relationships.

**Question 2:** The conflict?
**Answer:** 2 of Swords. Ann knows her problems and troubles but she doesn't want to see them. She must meditate on her problems to find answers. Ann may need to take action instead of waiting passively for the situation to clear up.

**Question 3:** Did I create the problem?
**Answer:** 7 of Wands. Ann should understand that we create our own reality. This path is a mental one and can lead to success and victory professionally and socially. Ann needs to take responsibility, not feel superior, and use her ego and will in positive ways.

**Question 4:** Am I refusing to see my part of the problem?
**Answer**: 8 of Pentacles. By perseverance in learning new skills and having the strength to cope with all types of experiences, Ann will see that everything ties in together. When we are involved in difficulties, it is often impossible to see solutions!

**Question 5:** Past experiences with my partner?
**Answer**: Queen of Cups. This Queen is a Scorpio and associated with love and emotions. Ann is powerful, intuitive, and intense. She is a good friend and a dangerous enemy. She desires to be in control in relationships and is very loyal. Her husband is deceased and she continues to work and stay busy.

****Question 6:** Are we abusive to each other?
**Answer**: Emperor (Reversed). Ann is not realizing her potential. She must learn to follow through with her plans, not be lazy or fearful. She must accept the fact that she has to rely on herself and her inner source for guidance. Ann is a widow and independent.

**Question 7:** Are other people involved with our problem?
**Answer**: 6 of Cups. This card refers to choices Ann must make regarding love and emotions. She will be tempted to live in the past, but the present is a happier place for her. There are new responsibilities and a potential new relationship. Other people are involved in Ann's life at the present time.

**Question 8:** Are there financial problems affecting our relationship?
**Answer:** The Sun. Ann is seeking truth and happiness. There is a potential for financial gain, a trip, and an increase in self-confidence. There are certain limitations, but this card shows no material loss. Health and vitality are assured!

**Question 9:** Will this relationship end?
**Answer:** 5 of Cups (Reversed). Ann is still emotionally drained over the loss of her husband. There is some fear of the future and little trust in a relationship. She does not believe in love or romance. If there has been a relationship since her loss, it probably did not last.

**Comment.** Ann is still young enough to get involved in a good relationship. Companionship is the answer for senior citizens and can give new direction and meaning to life. Now is the time to take a chance!

## READING
**Question 1:** Will I ever marry?
**Answer:** Tower (Reversed). Laura is afraid to change her old habit patterns of thinking about marriage. She fears losing her freedom; she has had one failed marriage and does not wish to repeat the experience. Potential for a new marriage is now!

**Question 2:** What kind of mate is compatible?
**Answer:** Temperance (Reversed). This card shows an imbalance in Laura's emotional life. She is a Gemini and this card is a Sagittarius, the opposite sign.

**Answer:** Queen of Swords (Reversed). Laura is not open and honest with herself. She would like to be married but fears making a mistake. Laura must communicate this to her new love if she intends to build a lasting relationship.

**Question 4:** Will we both desire a commitment?
**Answer:** 5 of Wands. This card relates to strife and disharmony. Laura believes in her own ideas and has the will to see them through, but she believes she must fight to get her ego needs met. She is independent and may decide not to get involved with anyone. She may have a difficult time committing herself at this time.

**Question 5:** Will we have similar likes and dislikes?
**Answer:** Queen of Pentacles (Reversed). Laura and her new love have spoken of marriage and children. Laura is not interested in having children and this factor made her more fearful. She wants to enjoy her life and be free to travel. She and her new love have similar tastes, but not in regard to children.

**Question 6:** Will this person's family accept me?
**Answer:** 4 of Swords. This card shows an imbalance in Laura's emotional life. Her new love comes from a wealthy family from the East coast and she feels a little uncertain about being welcomed into this family and being hurt in love.

**Question 7:** How shall we find each other?
**Answer:** Page of Swords. Laura and her new love have found each other and they must stop paying attention to others. Listening to her heart's desire will show Laura the way to happiness. Only Laura knows what is best for herself—listening to others can confuse the issue. She can be childish with her fears of losing her freedom by getting married.

**Question 8:** Will we be able to share our financial resources?
**Answer:** Wheel of Fortune. The Wheel of Fortune says "take a chance, gamble, and travel." Her new love has money of his own and their financial picture looks very bright.

**Question 9:** What can I do while I am waiting for my mate?
**Answer:** 4 of Pentacles (Reversed). Laura must create balance in her finances and health. Money is not the most important issue here. Laura must realize that this could be her magical dream come true and go for it.

**Question 10:** Outcome?
**Answer:** King of Swords (Reversed). This reversed King is fickle and superficial. He is also a Gemini, like Laura. This indicates that the outcome is up to Laura and what she will decide.

**Comment:** With many cards reversed in this spread, it is apparent that Laura is not thinking clearly. She will have to make a decision, but she has time. This new relationship can work out if there is love between the two parties. Only they know the truth!

## Marriage Spread for Glenda

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st   position   Knight of Pentacles
2nd   position   5 of Wands
3rd   position   Page of Wands
4th   position   Hanged Man (Reversed)
5th   position   4 of Wands (Reversed)
6th   position   Wheel of Fortune (Reversed)
7th   position   Hermit
8th   position   King of Swords
9th   position   4 of Cups
10th  position   Queen of Swords (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** Will I ever marry?
**Answer:** Knight of Pentacles. Glenda wants to marry if she finds a man of means who can support them both. She is waiting for an opportunity to go on vacation with him if he is willing to pay the bills.

**Question 2:** What kind of mate is compatible?
**Answer:** 5 of Wands. This card refers to a belief that one must fight to get ideas across at work and socially. With faith, one does not need to fight aggressively. Glenda wants a mate who will seek higher goals, use his will to gain recognition, and make money. Glenda's beliefs will bring her success if she is thinking positively.

**Question 3:** Will we have good methods of communication?
**Answer:** Page of Wands. This card shows an immature person who wants to work and have an active social life. Glenda and her friend rarely speak with each other. Her friend travels a good deal and stays busy.

**Question 4:** Will we both desire a commitment?
**Answer:** Hanged Man (Reversed). Glenda must be realistic and not just hang in there hoping things will change. She could meditate on this relationship to see if it is positive or futile. Perhaps she is committed but he is not.

**Question 5:** Will we have similar likes and dislikes?
**Answer:** 4 of Wands (Reversed). Glenda does not realize her thinking is out of balance. This card reversed shows no marriage, a lack of stability, and an unfruitful relationship. Glenda and her friend may have similar likes and dislikes but no basis for marriage.

**Question 6:** Will this person's family accept me?
**Answer:** Wheel of Fortune (Reversed). This is not the time for Glenda to gamble that his family will accept her. She must first make a relationship. Her friend is divorced and has two daughters, which could also present problems.

**Question 7:** How shall we find each other?
**Answer:** Hermit. Glenda has been divorced and has gained wisdom through her experiences in finding a mate. She must get in touch with her inner source and find the light to guide her to a loving partner.

**Question 8:** Will we be able to share our financial resources?
**Answer:** King of Swords. This is the card of a lawyer. Glenda may feel that she will need to protect herself legally or sign a prenuptial agreement in the event she does marry. This is a mental card and perhaps she should think about her beliefs.

**Question 9:** What can I do while I am waiting for my mate?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups. Glenda must realize that she is still holding on to her past love affairs (or her marriage). She needs to look at what is coming her way now—a new beginning in love—and grab it! Glenda must become balanced and not be ruled by her emotions. By changing her beliefs she will change her life.

**Question 10:** Outcome?
**Answer:** Queen of Swords (Reversed). Glenda does not want to stay single—she wants a marriage with equality and balance. She has problems and troubles of her own but Glenda would feel better about herself if she were married. She desires a mate—and soon!

**Comment:** Glenda must give up her past attitudes about men in order to have a positive relationship. She must not seek ineligible men and then hope to change them. If she feels this man is immature why desire the relationship to continue? Glenda is a Virgo and perhaps more critical and judgmental than she realizes, especially about men.

## Pregnancy Spread for Marcie

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st   position   8 of Pentacles (Reversed)
2nd   position   High Priestess (Reversed)
3rd   position   8 of Wands (Reversed)
4th   position   3 of Pentacles (Reversed)
5th   position   Empress (Reversed)

7th   position   Queen of Cups (Reversed)
8th   position   10 of Cups
9th   position   Wheel of Fortune
10th  position   Fool (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** Am I ready for a child?
**Answer:** 8 of Pentacles (Reversed). Marcie lacks confidence in herself and feels she does not have the strength to have a child now. She also wants quick money but does not wish to work hard to get it. Marcie's new partner has money but there are conditions she may not be willing to accept.

**Question 2:** Do I have enough confidence to be a parent?
**Answer:** High Priestess (Reversed). Marcie does not know if she would make a good parent. She has some fixed ideas and tends to over-analyze her experiences. She is having an emotionally draining period trying to make decisions.

**Question 3:** Will I be happy being a parent?
**Answer:** 8 of Wands (Reversed). Marcie is lacking strength in her work and social activities. Her thoughts are unbalanced and could end her new relationship. Marcie is feeling vulnerable and insecure. She is definitely not committed to being a parent, so happiness is not the problem for her now.

**Question 4:** Will the other parent of the child be supportive?
**Answer:** 3 of Pentacles (Reversed). Marcie does not believe she creates her own money and has little faith or trust in her creative abilities, which would include a child. Her new love has money and the potential to inherit more, so he would be financially able to support a child.

**Question 5:** Will I feel boxed in or lack freedom because of a child?
**Answer:** Empress (Reversed). Marcie thinks she does not create her own experiences. She has problems with her mother and other women. She has a fear of losing her freedom and feels sexually unfulfilled, so she may not commit to a relationship now. The relationship may be over before it really starts. Without a relationship, she would not want a child.

**Question 6:** What past behavior do I need to change to be better prepared for parenting?
**Answer:** 6 of Swords (Reversed). Marcie has no choice about making changes—she must stay and face the issues and work them out. Marcie finds it difficult to make decisions, especially about having children. She is divorced and has no children.

**Question 7:** Will I be able to give this child a good education?
**Answer:** Queen of Cups (Reversed). Yes, if she marries this new love who has plenty of money and is a professional in his career. But Marcie is not being honest with this man—she is emotionally drained, resentful, and afraid to trust her heart.

**Question 8:** Is there a potential for the child to have health problems?
**Answer:** 10 of Cups. There could be a new cycle of change for Marcie. This card refers to love on a higher plane and, with the rainbow, some good luck. The scene is happy and healthy for the entire family. Marcie does not need to worry about the child's health.

**Question 9:** Will my parents be involved and supportive?
**Answer:** Wheel of Fortune. Marcie must take a chance on her life. Most parents welcome grandchildren and are supportive in many ways. Marcie must let go of old ties in her professional or personal life that have become a burden. It is time for new experiences and taking risks. The time is right for success!

**Question 10:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** The Fool (Reversed). Marcie is really not looking for new experiences of a lasting nature. She is lacking confidence, is sexually focused, and materialistic. Marcie needs to balance her pleasures, desires, and sexual attitudes realistically and have faith in the future.

**Comment:** Marcie is fearful of making another error in judgment. She has had a failed marriage and does not want to repeat that again. She confessed her need for freedom and to be able to get involved whenever she felt like it! Marcie's mother has not been a good example for stable marriages and Marcie is afraid she will repeat her pattern.

## Pregnancy Spread for Betty

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st   position   The Sun (Reversed)
2nd   position   6 of Cups
3rd   position   Queen of Wands (Reversed)
4th   position   10 of Wands
5th   position   Knight of Cups (Reversed)
6th   position   Ace of Swords (Reversed)
7th   position   10 of Swords
8th   position   9 of Cups
9th   position   Death
10th  position   8 of Swords

### READING
**Question 1:** Am I ready for a child?
**Answer:** The Sun (Reversed). Betty lacks courage and confidence at this time, which means she should not have a child now. Her low energy may be detrimental to herself and the child and lead to health problems in the future. Betty has been disappointed in her relationships and this may be one of the reasons she is not ready to commit to becoming a mother.

**Question 2:** Do I have enough confidence to be a parent?
**Answer:** 6 of Cups. Betty has made her own choices in love relationships. This card shows the potential to live in the past, or to bring someone from the past into her life again, and that may not be positive. Betty is divorced, but she does not want to be a single parent. She is waiting for the right man to ask that important question, then she may consider having a child.

**Question 3:** Will I be happy being a parent?
**Answer:** Queen of Wands (Reversed). This Queen is a Leo, and people of this sign usually love children. They have great expectations and want their children to do well, as it is a reflection on the Leo ego. Betty is also career minded, so having a child may be a barrier to her ambitions.

**Question 4:** Will the other parent of the child be supportive?
**Answer:** 10 of Wands. According to this card the answer is "yes." Betty would not have to carry the burden alone and her job could get better along the way. The other parent will help Betty in many ways and also support the child.

**Question 5:** Will I feel boxed in or lack freedom because of the child?
**Answer:** Knight of Cups (Reversed). The lack of freedom is Betty's greatest fear. Just thinking about having a child has created an emotional drain and a strain on her relationship. Betty may be a procrastinator and not always honest. The Knight indicates that she did not get the message she was expecting and now she prefers not to make any decisions.

**Question 6:** What past behavior do I need to change to be better prepared for parenting?
**Answer:** Ace of Swords (Reversed). Betty must change some of her negative beliefs. Meditation and creative visualization can help her do this. She has little self-confidence or self-esteem, something that must be dealt with and resolved. All parents are apprehensive and want to do a good job raising their children. First-time parents feel a great deal of stress at this time, but experience is the only teacher when dealing with babies.

**Question 7:** Shall I be able to give this child a good education?
**Answer:** 10 of Swords. This card indicates big changes in store for Betty. Burdens will be lifted and her negative cycle is passing. There is plenty of time to be concerned with a complete education for a child who is not born yet.

**Question 8:** Is there a potential for the child to have health problems?
**Answer:** 9 of Cups. The wish card upright means you will get your wish. As she was thinking about health matters in regard to the child, I would say that the child would be in excellent health.

**Question 9:** Will my parents be involved and supportive?
**Answer:** Death. Betty's father is dead but her mother is alive and well and will be supportive, accepting the child under any circumstances. This child would show an end to a situation and a change for the better. This is the time for transformation, so let go of old experiences that have no meaning now in your life and grab new opportunities.

**Question 10:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** 8 of Swords. Betty has the strength to cope with all her experiences, and especially with her problems. She has a fear of making changes or taking risks. This can be a frustrating time for her, but only she can make the final decisions.

**Comment:** It is difficult to raise a child as a single parent, but many are attempting to do so. Betty is in her forties and will soon run out of options. Feeling she has made one "mistake" in marriage, she is reluctant to try again. These decisions are very personal and Betty is the only one capable of making them for herself. Her desires will win the day!

# Chapter 6: ON THE MOVE

IN THIS CHAPTER, TRAVEL AND MAKING changes are highlighted. There are four spreads, three with sample readings and one without. The spreads are:
    Desire to Move
    Taking a Trip
    Relocation
    Planning a Trip

The last spread, "Planning a Trip," uses only six cards and should provide enough information in the reading to satisfy the querent. Each spread relates to changes of some kind for the individual and will allow them to make choices. Once an idea has been planted in a person's mind, it must be thought over until a conclusion is reached. New ideas propel us forward and are always healthy. They take us out of our ruts and into a new realm of hope and curiosity. Looking forward to a new adventure can be very stimulating and the Tarot cards can give us these new ideas.

## DESIRE TO MOVE
This spread is used to explore the desire or intention to relocate, whether it's moving homes, changing environments, or shifting life directions.
It compares the current situation to the imagined future, and highlights both emotional and practical factors, as well as spiritual guidance.

10th  position   Page of Pentacles (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** What are my concerns involving this move?
**Answer:** 2 of Pentacles (Reversed). Andrea is a free spender and does not like to budget her money. She feels this makes her happy. Andrea fears the move will be expensive and she has only been in her new place about two years.

**Question 2:** What is the conflict?
**Answer:** 4 of Pentacles. Andrea, a senior citizen, does not know whether to rent or buy. Her conflict is trying to rent a nice place inexpensively. Andrea would like to hold on to her resources for security reasons. She also owns property that she has rented to others. Balanced energy is important now, due to her sudden desire to move.

**Question 3:** Will I be happy when I make this move?
**Answer:** 7 of Cups. This could be the path to happiness! Creative visualization can create an environment that makes all your dreams come true. If Andrea surrounds herself with positive thoughts, she will find the perfect place.

**Question 4:** How will my new home, new area, and work affect me?
**Answer:** 9 of Pentacles (Reversed). Andrea is not using wisdom in her finances. She has been a widow for several years and is still learning through experience about money matters. Andrea does not feel independent or able to do things on her own, but she is learning.

**Question 5:** What are my options about the move in the next few weeks?
**Answer:** Lovers. Andrea has the choice of staying where she is or moving back to her old stomping grounds. She is living close to her son, his wife, and Andrea's two grandchildren at this time. Her concern is for the two little ones, but she must decide soon.

**Question 6:** What choices did I make in the past that are affecting me now?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups (Reversed). Thinking about leaving her two grandchildren leaves Andrea emotionally drained. She admitted that her services were not being utilized by her daughter-in-law, and that was the reason she moved near the family. The decision Andrea made in the past was not a positive one for her.

**Question 7:** Will I learn new skills at work or home?
**Answer:** High Priestess. Andrea is smart and she knows a lot that she could teach others. It will be a happier experience for Andrea to be among her old friends and making new ones.

**Question 8:** What does my financial future hold?
**Answer:** Ace of Pentacles. It appears that Andrea will have new beginnings with money providing some new financial aspect in her life that will be positive.

**Question 9:** What are my hopes and fears about the move?
**Answer:** 8 of Wands (Reversed). Andrea felt a lack of strength in dealing with her son's family. They did not meet socially and Andrea felt rebuffed at any other meetings with her daughter-in-law. Andrea fears she will not have much contact with this family if she moves. She hopes that all goes well with them and if she can help them, she will.

**Question 10:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles (Reversed). This card refers to the student who refuses to make money for schooling. The Page is an earth sign, practical and material. Andrea's two young grandchildren are both Taurus, and one will be entering school in September.

**Comment:** Regardless of what happens in her son's life, Andrea must still make decisions concerning her own. She can stay in touch with her grandchildren and do the best she can. This spread has shown a great deal of thinking about money, which is not healthy. Alice needs other interests to keep herself happy and involved with living her life to her fullest potential.

**Answer:** Justice (Reversed). There could be legal problems and Sylvia's health could be affected. She feels her landlord is very unfair and has had problems with other landlords; she dreads getting involved with a new one. Sylvia prefers owning her own home and has negative feelings about renting.

**Question 2:** What is the conflict?
**Answer:** Hermit. This card reflects an ending to some situation which has been handled in a positive manner. Sylvia must remember her past landlords and bless them—if she has negative feelings about them, the lesson is repeated. Using wisdom gained through experience brings success.

**Question 3:** Will I be happy when I make this move?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles. This is the card of the student who is interested in making money, having a career, and reaching the top in their chosen field. Sylvia is ambitious, materialistic, and somewhat traditional. She sees greater opportunities for her career by making a move, as well as a chance to find happiness in a new area.

**Question 4:** How will my new home, new area, and work affect me?
**Answer:** 7 of Cups (Reversed). This card reversed does not assure success for Sylvia. There could be a loss through love or an emotional drain due to the move. Sylvia needs to do creative visualization and bring positive experiences into her life. She needs more faith and trust in her inner resources also.

**Question 5:** What are my options (about the move) in the next few weeks?
**Answer:** 2 of Cups (Reversed). Sylvia does not know she is in an emotionally stressful time. She is uncertain about her direction and there are no easy answers to her questions. Perhaps the move will take longer than she anticipated or her health will be affected by stress.

**Question 6:** What choices did I make in the past that are affecting me now?
**Answer:** 9 of Wands (Reversed). This card reversed refers to delayed plans and a lack of wisdom through experience. Sylvia was not open to new information in the past and may have been intolerant, critical, and judgmental. Some of the choices she made were not as positive as she thought.

**Question 7:** Will I learn new skills at work or at home?
**Answer:** Temperance. Sylvia has the potential to learn positive outlets for her energy, to have self-control, and achieve harmony with herself. She could also learn to have more patience and temper her ego needs. Sylvia will be able to learn new skills and perhaps get involved with a hobby or two.

**Question 8:** What does my financial future hold for me?
**Answer:** Knight of Wands. This messenger is bringing Sylvia information concerning work and social activities. There is good news relating to work, planning a trip, or a change of residence. The potential for a bright future and financial well-being seems to be the answer for Sylvia through this card.

**Question 9:** What are my hopes and fears about the move?
**Answer:** 5 of Wands (Reversed). Sylvia may fear some loss in her business if she moves. She does not desire to fight for her ideas and there is a lack of belief in her thinking. Sylvia's fears are focused on work and her social life. These fears may be keeping her from moving. Sylvia must use creative visualization about her business and believe that her inner source will guide her in the right direction.

**Question 10:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** Wheel of Fortune. This card indicates it is time to make changes, take a chance on a new venture, or travel. Gambling for fun or profit is also an option now. This would be a good time for Sylvia to make herself happy. The success that Sylvia is seeking is there for her—she needs a positive attitude and the desire to win!

**Comment:** There are many people involved with Sylvia, in her business and in her life (there are four Major Arcana cards and two Court cards, all telling of people affecting the querent). Sylvia is interested in change and her life has been full of it. Looking back at her experiences she sees that she has been successful in many areas of her life and that it need not change now. In the end, Sylvia is the one who must make the decision.

### READING
**Question 1:** Where do I want to go?
**Answer:** Knight of Wands (Reversed). This Knight brings negative news regarding work and social activities, which brings delays and frustration at work and socially. She and several of her friends were planning a ship tour, but two of them have been fighting and refuse to go. They all want to back out, but Tara had her heart set on this trip. Tara is upset and angry over the turn of events.

**Question 2:** Do I have enough money for a trip?
**Answer:** High Priestess. Tara can afford this trip. She also has enough money to board her dog, whom she loves dearly and is not sure she wants to leave him.

**Question 3:** Should I go with friends or family?
**Answer:** Fool (Reversed). Tara needs more confidence and must take responsibility for making her own decisions. Tara's friends are acting immaturely and will miss out if they don't go. Tara has waited a long time for this trip and would be foolish to give it up.

**Question 4:** Would I be happier on a tour?
**Answer:** Page of Wands. This Page is eager to experience life and to be out in public. Tara needs change, new experiences, and excitement in her life as she rarely goes anywhere. She really wants to go on this cruise, which is a tour.

**Question 5:** Shall I go by plane?
**Answer:** 2 of Swords (Reversed). Tara does not want to fly. Although she's never flown before she has a fear of flying—a cruise is ideal for her. It is a leisurely way to travel with accommodations and food. Tara loves food, so all of her needs will be met! She does not want to face any problems, she just wants to go on her trip.

**Question 6:** Shall I go by boat or train?
**Answer:** 6 of Pentacles (Reversed). This vacation is already planned and a ship is the method of travel. Tara did agree to go and she can afford it—though she may fear losing her deposit. If her friends don't stop feuding, she may not go at all.

**Question 7:** What are the obstacles to my trip?
**Answer:** Queen of Swords. This card refers to a Libra woman—Tara is a Libra. Libras often have problems making decisions, fearing they are not right. This means that she creates her own obstacles and is hesitant to spend money on pleasure trips. Tara is used to being involved with problems and rarely takes time to be nice to herself.

**Question 8:** What kind of experiences will I have?
**Answer:** 9 of Swords (Reversed). Tara fears she will not enjoy herself on this trip. She is not in crisis, but she could create her own drama due to her insecurities, low self-esteem, or indecision (a Libra trait).

**Question 9:** Will I meet someone special on this trip?
**Answer:** 5 of Cups (Reversed). This card indicates that Tara refuses to believe in love or romance. She feels emotionally drained by her family and the loss of her parents. Tara is still playing old tapes about relationships and feels she has passed her prime. Tara is a loner, but still young enough to have a good relationship if she wants it.

**Question 10:** Outcome?
**Answer:** 4 of Swords (Reversed). Tara says she does not realize her problems and troubles. She is doing too much, she just got transferred on her job, and now this problem of "are we going or not." As of yet no decisions have been made and the trip is in limbo.

**Comment:** It has been a long time since Tara has done something nice for herself. After the reading she was almost convinced that she should go. One of her friends said she would go if Tara wanted to, and if only two take the trip, it will be fine. Of course, it is always more fun to have a group, but if that doesn't work, then go, even if you're alone. Why not? With all the reversed cards in this spread, chances are the trip will not be taken.

### READING
**Question 1:** Where do I want to go?
**Answer:** Ace of Swords. Jody has been thinking about taking a vacation but is not sure where she would like to go. Jody feels there are new problems for her to resolve in her personal life and taking a trip would not be possible.

**Question 2:** Do I have enough money for a trip?
**Answer:** The Lovers. Jody must make decisions in her life. By accepting her responsibilities and having faith in her inner source she will realize her abundance. Now is the time for a trip or other happy events. This card is also a flag that Jody should take care of health needs now.

**Question 3:** Should I go with friends or family?
**Answer:** The Moon. Jody has all kinds of fears and she must decide if she will be more comfortable among friends or family. Jody is swayed by her emotions and ends up feeling victimized. She does not always want to see the truth, and some of her friends are not loyal.

## Question 4: Would I be happier on a tour?
**Answer:** 4 of Wands. This card relates to marriage, work, and social activities. Perhaps Jody would consider a tour where she could meet other people. She must realize it is her right to choose where to go and with whom. The affair will be balanced and fruitful, and that is good news!

## Question 5: Shall I go by plane?
**Answer:** Queen of Pentacles. Jody will investigate the costs of the trip. She is an idealist and a perfectionist, so all the details will be worked out first. Jody works to make money and spending it is difficult for her. Her decision to go by plane will be predicated on cost.

## Question 6: Shall I go by boat or train?
**Answer:** Devil (Reversed). Jody does have a preference. She wants to take a trip but she does not want to spend a lot of money. A boat trip would be Jody's choice, if the price is not exorbitant.

## Question 7: What are the obstacles to my trip?
**Answer:** 3 of Swords. Jody must understand that she is creating her own problems. Her siblings want to take the trip too, but they can't agree on the time. Her decision must be based on her needs or she may miss her opportunity to go at all. Jody also feels that some members of her family are cheating her out of her vacation.

**Question 8:** What kind of experiences will I have?
**Answer:** 10 of Cups. Jody will have major changes in her love and emotional life. A trip is definitely slated for her at this time. There could be a new relationship, happiness, and harmony for Jody if she makes a positive decision for herself.

**Question 9:** Will I meet someone special on this trip?
**Answer:** The Hierophant. There is a potential that Jody will learn a great deal on this trip. It may be her inner source or someone she gets involved with. It will be a time to meditate, be silent, and trust her intuition.

**Question 10:** Outcome?
**Answer:** Death. Past situations are ending now and Jody has new ideas and plans for the future which indicate a change for the better. She must be open to love, let go of old habit patterns, and release resentments. She can use her energy to manifest a richer and fuller life.

**Comment:** Getting rid of old habit patterns is an important matter for everyone. Meditation and creative visualization will change a person's life. Jody must have faith in herself and her inner source to know she is never alone.

## Relocation Spread for Marty

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st   position    Ace of Swords 
2nd   position    Page of Pentacles 
3rd   position    King of Pentacles (Reversed) 
4th   position    Ace of Wands 
5th   position    Queen of Wands (Reversed) 
6th   position    2 of Pentacles (Reversed) 

### READING
**Question 1:** Why do I wish to relocate?
**Answer:** Ace of Swords. Marty ended a relationship and had a loss in his family which made him very unhappy. Aces always indicate new beginnings and Marty could see new problems arising for him.

**Question 2:** Is there a potential for a new job?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles. The potential for a new job is great, as is further schooling to go along with the job. It could mean "on-the-job training," which Marty would accept.

**Question 3:** Is there a problem with my health in this area?
**Answer:** King of Pentacles (Reversed). There could be health problems for Marty if he becomes lazy, too focused on sensual pleasures, or impractical with money. Marty is a Virgo, and work and health issues are their main drives. Balance is the answer. Pentacles refer to Earth. These signs are Taurus (King of Pentacles), Virgo (Queen of Pentacles), and Capricorn (Page of Pentacles). Earth signs are material and practical when positive, but greedy and grasping when negative.

**Question 4:** Will this move be successful financially?
**Answer:** Ace of Wands. Marty will have new beginnings in his work and social life. There will be opportunities and potentials for him in this move both financially and socially. Marty should look forward to an exciting time during this period.

**Question 5:** Will I be happy in this new location?
**Answer:** Queen of Wands (Reversed). This card can indicate a domineering, demanding, and controlling boss. Marty will need to do good work, be punctual, and be efficient to please this person. If Marty pays attention to his job he can be happy.

**Question 6:** Is it possible that this will be a permanent relocation?
**Answer:** 2 of Pentacles (Reversed). Marty must learn as much as possible about his work, take care of his finances, and stay healthy. This card can indicate a lack of balance in money matters which Marty must overcome. It is possible!

**Comment:** This move could prove beneficial for Marty. It would change his environment and job and give him more potential options for new relationships. Now is the time to risk the move and make a new start.

## All About Me for Kerry

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD 
1st   position   8 of Pentacles
2nd   position   9 of Swords (Reversed)
3rd   position   The Empress
4th   position   10 of Swords (Reversed)

8th   position   2 of Cups
9th   position   Judgment (Reversed)
10th  position   5 of Swords

### READING
**Question 1:** How do I get my ego needs fulfilled?
**Answer:** 8 of Pentacles. Kerry is a school teacher and has the strength to do a good job at work. Kerry is learning about politics and ego needs. She ran for the office of coordinator at her school, but lost by a narrow margin. Kerry was an apprentice at that time but is knowledgeable now. She must try another direction to fulfill her ego needs.

**Question 2:** What influence does my mother still have on me?
Answer: 9 of Swords (Reversed). Kerry lacked wisdom regarding her mother. She was in crisis regarding her problems but would not discuss them with her mother. There are ten children in Kerry's family and she wants her mom to love and accept her even though she is a rebel. The question is—what can her mom do to prove she loves Kerry?

**Question 3:** Am I reacting to my father's influence?
**Answer:** The Empress. Kerry's father is kind and gentle, and she loves him, but she may not have respected him. When dad is kind and gentle and mom (The Empress) rules the roost, a child is confused about who is the boss in the home. If Kerry needed protection as a youngster and her dad failed to be there, Kerry would feel vulnerable to males. This distortion occurs as dad is the male role model for all females in the home. Kerry's problems with men stem from this early conditioning and is changing some of her beliefs.

**Question 4:** Do I use my value judgment against myself?
**Answer:** 10 of Swords (Reversed). Kerry is still carrying her problems as a burden. She wants change, but the only way that can happen is if she changes her thinking. This card indicates that she may be judging herself too harshly.

**Question 5:** Is my response to sex and my physical body positive?
**Answer:** 10 of Cups. Yes, it is. Since Kerry has been working with Tarot her focus has changed and she has placed herself on a higher emotional level. The rainbow in the card is a sign of good luck and her home life has improved. The changes Kerry is making are healthy.

**Question 6:** Are my choices regarding relationships good for me?
**Answer:** Temperance (Reversed). Kerry's choices in relationships are not positive. There is a lack of balance in her or her partner. This has caused an emotional drain and much unhappiness for Kerry. She must realize that she has manifested her relationships and should reconsider her needs before she gets involved with a new partner.

**Question 7:** Success is my goal. Do I have enough faith to succeed?
**Answer:** 3 of Cups. This card verifies that Kerry makes her relationships, that she says, "I make my love and emotions, I make myself happy, and I make my pleasures." Her relationships do not seem to be positive and she shows a lack of faith in that portion of her life. Her ability to be successful in her job is without question.

**Question 8:** Are my financial affairs affected by my belief in lack?
**Answer:** 2 of Cups. Kerry knows that being in a good relationship is healthy, but she does not have a partner at this time. There seems to be a desire to help others and be loving, but not get too entangled herself. Perhaps she does not wish to spend money on a relationship just to have one. Kerry admitted that her finances are in sad shape and during the summer she intends to do extra work rather than spend her resources.

**Question 9:** Why do I feel victimized?
**Answer:** Judgment (Reversed). Kerry is not paying attention and lacks awareness in her affairs. She does not understand her own nature but is studying the Tarot now, which will give her insight into herself. She is beginning to realize what part she is playing in her own life and that she is victimizing herself.

**Question 10:** In what way can I change my life?
**Answer:** 5 of Swords. Kerry believes that relationships are too much trouble. She must not fight with others to get her own way all the time. She needs to feel confident and do what is right for herself. Changes will happen!

**Comment:** Kerry must release her pressures and enjoy life now. Let go of the battles and learn to love yourself!

### READING
**Question 1:** How do I get my ego needs fulfilled?
**Answer:** 3 of Wands (Reversed). Gail does not use creative visualization to get what she wants at work or socially. She does not make herself happy, go on trips, or communicate her desires. Gail must ask herself what her ego needs are in order to fulfill them.

**Question 2:** What influence does my mother still have on me?
**Answer:** The Devil. Gail feels oppressed by her mother. Her mother is focused on materialism and Gail is caught up in this influence. She can release herself any time by considering what she still wants from her mother.

**Question 3:** Am I reacting to my father's influence?
**Answer:** 6 of Cups. Gail's parents were divorced when Gail was a little girl and she must make a choice—whether to hold on to past hurts and feelings of rejection or to forgive her dad. Gail is still waiting for love from her dad and it stands in the way of her relationships now.

**Question 4:** Do I use my value judgment against myself?
**Answer:** Ace of Pentacles (Reversed). Gail is judging herself and denying herself many life experiences. She just got a new job and makes more money but still feels insecure about her finances. Gail must ask herself how she values her life and whether she feels worthy. With these answers she may change her life.

**Question 5:** Is my response to sex and my physical body positive?
**Answer:** Lovers (Reversed). No. Gail may be refusing to seek a new partner because her last relationship is not completely over. She has no choice in the matter, except to finish it. Gail claims they are now friends.

**Question 6:** Are my choices regarding relationships good for me?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups. Gail is reflecting on her past relationships and not paying attention to what is being offered her. If past partners have not been positive, then she is not making good choices. By changing her beliefs, she also changes her choices. Gail must realize that she is out of balance and afraid to trust her heart for fear of being hurt. She, like the Emperor, is the boss—independent, the initiator and full of good ideas. She is in charge of her life at all times.

**Question 7:** Success is my goal. Do I have enough faith to succeed?
**Answer:** 7 of Swords (Reversed). Gail is on the material and physical path. She does not have the faith in herself and often feels cheated. Gail also feels that other people are creating her problems rather than taking responsibility for her own actions. Success is always possible when a person has faith and trust in self.

**Question 8:** Are my financial affairs affected by my belief in lack?
**Answer:** 6 of Pentacles (Reversed). Gail feels she has no choice in financial matters and believes others are in control of her money. In fact, Gail may not want to share her resources and feels guilty. Sharing is natural, but a child forced to share may grow up resentful and refuse to be charitable. This attitude leads to belief in lack.

**Question 9:** Why do I feel victimized?
**Answer:** The Hermit. Gail feels unloved and alone. The Hermit is a Virgo card and her father is a Virgo. Dad is very critical and judgmental. Gail rarely sees him and she would like to have a better relationship with him. She is searching for a teacher or an inner guide.

**Question 10:** In what way can I change my life?
**Answer:** 6 of Swords (Reversed). Gail thinks she does not have a choice in changing her life, but she does. She must work her life out by changing her beliefs. Meditation and visualization are both methods that work. Thinking is destiny!

**Comment:** Parents are here to guide us, not carry us through life. Ask yourself what you want from them and then release them. Love and forgiveness—try it!

**Question 1:** How do I get my ego needs fulfilled?
**Answer:** 10 of Swords. This card indicates that Ruth will have big changes in her problems and troubles. She feels pinned down and unable to move, but soon some of her burdens will be lifted. While these changes are taking place, her mental attitude will also change. If she is waiting for someone else to fulfill her ego needs, she will not be satisfied and perhaps disappointed. She must fulfill her own ego needs, not wait for others to do it.

**Question 2:** What influence does my mother still have on me?
**Answer:** 3 of Swords (Reversed). Ruth feels she does not make her own problems, that others are responsible for her trials. She has a rejection complex and 
Ruth feels insecure. Some of her friends are proving untrustworthy and she is confused. Ruth has always had problems with her mom and has never felt accepted by her. Ruth and her two daughters are now living with her mom and she feels some guilt about this. Ruth and a friend were planning to go on a cruise. Perhaps Ruth feels she should not go on this trip, spending her money on pleasure and enjoyment.

**Question 3:** Am I reacting to my father's influence?
**Answer:** Justice. Ruth admitted she felt abandoned by her dad. She is divorced and was upset to learn that her two daughters also felt abandoned by their father. As a child, Ruth loved her dad but felt rejected by him which set up a pattern for her in relationships with other men. Old habit patterns are difficult to break, especially when a person refuses to notice they keep repeating the same kind of experiences. Ruth agreed with this analysis.

**Question 4:** Do I use my value judgment against myself?
**Answer:** Knight of Pentacles (Reversed). This Knight does not bring good news about money or indicates that messages were not received. There are delays or failure of existing plans and Ruth may be denying herself sex, a home, or money due to her early experiences with her parents. She is using her value judgment against herself.

**Question 5:** Is my response to sex and my physical body positive?
**Answer:** 6 of Cups. Ruth is living in the past and her emories are not very positive. She must take responsibility for her sexual exploits. She is over-weight, which is not good for her body. If Ruth won't take care of her own needs, who will? She must make choices.

**Question 6:** Are my choices regarding relationships good for me?
**Answer:** Ace of Wands (Reversed). This card reflects no new beginnings in work or socially. Plans are canceled, there are delays and frustrations. Ruth does not respect males, so any relationship she attracts would be problematic. With understanding, she could change her attitude and change her life.

**Question 7:** Success is my goal. Do I have enough faith to succeed?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups (Reversed). Ruth does not realize she is keeping herself from success. She doesn't feel loved, fears a commitment, and has been disappointed in her relationships. She has unrealistic expectations, which stop her from getting involved. Ruth lacks balance, is not always honest, and admitted she was lazy. Faith to succeed comes from loving yourself and being willing to work toward your goals.

**Question 8:** Are my financial affairs affected by my belief in lack?
**Answer:** 7 of Wands. Ruth would like to feel she is doing superior work at her job. She has the ability to be successful in business or socially if she wants to be. She is a Cancer who needs to feel nurtured, safe, and secure. Having a home of her own is an important issue, yet she is living with her mother and working part-time.

**Question 9:** Why do I feel victimized?
**Answer:** Emperor (Reversed). Ruth does not realize her potential. She is fearful, immature, lacking balance, and not always honest. She could be a leader, boss, or in management. Ruth is not as warm and loving as she thinks and likes to control her environment. She is a good actress and believes the part she is playing. Ruth victimizes herself without realizing what she is doing. It is time to wake up and make changes.

**Question 10:** In what way can I change my life?
**Answer:** Devil (Reversed). Ruth must learn not to be so selfish, to feel secure, and not focus on material possessions. She could take more responsibility for her life and be an example for her daughters. Losing weight should be another priority and would make her proud of herself. If Ruth does these things she will change her life for the better!

**Comment:** What a person believes will manifest in their life. Consciousness is all we have to work with, and by paying attention to our thinking, we realize why our lives are the way they are. Ruth was able to see how she could change her life through the Tarot cards and their meaning as applied to the questions. If she takes a chance on herself, her life will become different and more enjoyable.

3rd position Devil (Reversed)

5th position Moon (Reversed)
6th position Hanged Man (Reversed)
7th position King of Cups
8th position 4 of Wands

### READING
**Question 1:** Will my life change soon?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles. This Page indicates a scholar. This person wants to earn money to go to college and get a good education. Eric is almost fifteen and is determined to have a career in math or science. He and his family are on vacation in northern California, so there are changes in his life now.

**Question 2:** Will a new relationship be exciting and sexy?
**Answer:** 7 of Swords (Reversed). Eric does not have a relationship at this time. He did not like leaving his friends and almost refused to go with his family on this trip. Eric is too involved with his school work and a little immature to have a boy-girl relationship.

**Question 3:** What chance is there for my ex-lover's return?
**Answer:** Devil (Reversed). There is no ex- or present lover for Eric. However, there is less selfishness or greed for material possessions. He is beginning to accept responsibility and face the reality of life. A change of diet will create better health.

**Question 4:** What is my potential to win or inherit money?
**Answer:** Star (Reversed). Eric is not optimistic about his career, life in general, or his goals. He has some vague ideas but gets bored easily. Eric must change his belief system now in order to have a more productive life. He is a Virgo, and people of this sign always feel they must "work" for anything they want. Winning would be against their belief!

**Question 5:** Is there a trip in my future?
**Answer:** Moon (Reversed). Eric is on that trip now. His mother is a teacher and plans family trips around educational destinations. This does not always please the rest of the family and they feel forced to go. Eric feels emotionally stressed not to have his way.

**Question 6:** Am I working out my karma?
**Answer:** Hanged Man (Reversed). This card refers to a person who does not trust their inner source, and does not accept new information easily. Eric is stubborn and physically and materially focused, which often puts him on the defensive. With maturity, some of these ideas will change and so will his life.

**Question 7:** Will I have a long and happy life?
**Answer:** King of Cups. This King represents an older man, so this would indicate a long life. When Eric grows up and becomes loving, caring, and nurturing, he will be happy. If Eric feels safe and secure in his professional life and within himself, he will have a good and joyous life.

**Question 8:** Will I marry more than one time?
**Answer:** 4 of Wands. Eric believes that when he gets married it will be permanent, balanced, and fruitful. He wants a solid relationship, for the two of them to work together, and to enjoy a good social life.

**Comment:** As can be seen, even at fourteen, a person's mind can be set with belief systems. Eric was apprehensive when I asked him to do this spread and all of the reversed cards indicate his unwillingness to participate. He is an intelligent youngster and works well with his hands. Eric has a lot of potential.

She may feel cheated or she could lose valuables and should take care when meeting new people. Valery must be prepared for new experiences by being open and honest.

**Question 3:** What chance is there for my ex-lover's return?
**Answer:** Page of Swords (Reversed). This Page has many troubles and is not a free thinker. Perhaps Valery's ex-lover is not a mentally stable person. She must examine her motives if she wants him to come back into her life.

**Question 4:** What is my potential to win or inherit money?
**Answer:** The Wheel of Fortune. This card indicates that it is time for Valery to take a chance, gamble, or take a trip. Now is the time to let go of old ties in business or relationships that are a burden. Valery must seek happiness, be positive, and stay healthy. Success in money matters is likely at this time.

**Question 5:** Is there a trip in my future?
**Answer:** 4 of Swords (Reversed). A trip for Valery at this time would be beneficial and rest could aid her health. She has been stretching the limits of her physical body and creating inner tension. She needs a change in her environment and a trip is the best answer.

**Question 6:** Am I working out my karma?
**Answer:** 5 of Wands. To work out her karma, Valery could try to be more loving and understanding of others. She has family strife and many challenges from co-workers. Valery wants to promote her own ideas at her work and social life, but ego needs can cause dissension in Valery's life and must be curbed.

**Question 7:** Will I have a long and happy life?
**Answer:** Queen of Pentacles. This Queen is involved with health matters and making money. She has critical views, is an idealist and perfectionistic. Valery is an Earth sign, and as a rule these people have strong and healthy bodies. She should have a long life and happiness will be her choice.

**Question 8:** Will I marry more than one time?
**Answer:** King of Cups. This King is emotional, loving, caring, and nurturing. When married, he is a good family man. As long as he feels secure in a situation, he will remain. Valery would do well to marry this type of man. If she does, one marriage is likely. If not, more than one marriage is probable.

**Comment:** Valery has a chance to change her life and be happy. She had three reversed cards in her spread, but overall the reading was positive. Her destiny looks very bright and shows a lot of potential. Valery should feel good about her future.

10th position 9 of Swords (Reversed)
11th position 10 of Cups (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** What am I afraid of?
**Answer:** 10 of Pentacles (Reversed). Olivia fears not having money and does not feel that lack of finances can ever change for the better. Olivia is not prosperity minded, and it stems from her early childhood.

**Question 2:** Is my safety or security at risk?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles (Reversed). Olivia did not continue her schooling and does not have a professional career. She feels that her earning power is limited and getting a good paying job is not possible. Olivia's security needs are in jeopardy and by going back to school her potentials can be increased. This will make her feel safe and secure in the future.

**Question 3:** Is there someone to whom I can communicate my fears and get help?
**Answer:** The Empress (Reversed). Olivia does not feel her mom will be of any assistance to her and has no relationship at this time, which leaves her feeling alone and vulnerable. Olivia needs a counselor and perhaps she can find one at school if she decides to go.

**Question 4:** Are my fears focused at my workplace?
**Answer:** The Fool. Olivia seems bored at her job. She wants new experiences, some activity and adventure in her life. Olivia must use caution because she does not have a relationship, is unhappy at home, and is not enjoying her life. She must pay attention to the environment and be confident that change will occur.

**Question 5:** Do my fears concern sex or injury to my personal self?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups. Olivia is hanging on to past experiences that were not positive. She may have been hurt emotionally and fears getting involved with the same type of experience. Olivia must change her mental attitude and trust her instincts.

**Question 6:** Are these fears creating health problems for me?
**Answer:** 9 of Cups (Reversed). This card indicates an emotional drain and unhappiness in love. Olivia suffered a loss through her relationship and by dwelling on this negativity, her health can be affected. She did not want to end this affair even though it was not positive. Olivia must learn to control her emotions and have a healthier outlook on life.

**Question 7:** Do my fears involve other people?
**Answer:** Ace of Wands. Olivia will be making new business and social contacts because she will have new beginnings and opportunities. If she fears these contacts, she will not be able to change her life.

**Question 8:** Do my fears stem from a lack of self-confidence or feelings of inadequacy?
**Answer:** Knight of Wands (Reversed). Olivia hates delays and frequently becomes frustrated both on the job and with her lack of social outings. She has not been very active socially, which makes her feel less self-confident.

**Question 9:** Why do I feel like a victim?
**Answer:** 7 of Wands. If Olivia feels superior on the job or socially, and she does not have a relationship, she may think others do not respect her. Olivia can have success and victory by treating her co-workers and personal relationships equally. Feeling like a victim is demeaning and Olivia must always respect herself.

**Question 10:** What type of changes can I make to overcome my fears?
**Answer:** 9 of Swords (Reversed). Olivia is in a crisis state that can soon come to a head. She must change her thinking and use wisdom in all situations. She must learn to trust her inner self and seek guidance from within. By recognizing her problems, answers will soon come to her—becoming aware is the first step toward a solution.

**Question 11:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** 10 of Cups (Reversed). Olivia's family makes her feel emotionally drained and she does not see immediate changes in her family affairs or relationships. Olivia must try to look on the positive side and do the best she can. She can only change herself but she wants to change others, which is impossible.

**Comment:** Olivia is going through a rough period in her life, but it will strengthen her resolve to make her life better. If she decides to go to school it could give her a new perspective. Her life is her choice and she must do the best she can.

10th position Wheel of Fortune (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** What are my past negative habit patterns?
**Answer:** King of Wands. Ellie has a good friend in business transactions and has some fears about trusting her own judgment. This King likes to start things but doesn't always stay to finish up, which Ellie enjoys doing. It should make her feel accomplished when she finishes any business deal in a positive manner.

**Question 2:** How are they affecting my life?
**Answer:** The Tower. This card indicates Ellie must throw out her old habits and learn to depend on herself. This friend may decide to leave and Ellie must be prepared to have faith in her own judgment. She may have sudden insights into future events—if she is aware of this possibility she will not feel abandoned.

**Question 3:** What methods can I use to become aware of these patterns?
**Answer: 6 of Pentacles (Reversed).** This card indicates that Ellie does not make decisions regarding her finances. This is not wise of her and she must change her attitude about money immediately. Ellie must take control of her life and not lean on others. Meditation and seeking truth can make it easier for her to institute changes now.

**Question 4:** Are other people involved with my past patterns?
s.** Ellie is in business and it is natural to assume that she has been involved with others. She enjoys being an independent woman of means and people are attracted to her because she is a winner. Although she has money, she seems to lack ideas that would increase her business, so she constantly seeks help from those who have creative skills.

**Question 5:** Will I be able to overcome these patterns?
**Answer: 4 of Wands (Reversed).** Ellie feels uncertain at this time. She fears her business may decline, that she will have a loss of finances, and that she will have no one to rely on. This is negative thinking, which can attract exactly those experiences she fears. Ellie can overcome these patterns by thinking positively, sending love to all, and having faith in herself.

**Question 6:** What decisions must I make now?
**Answer: The Moon.** Ellie must face the truth in all of her experiences and learn to control her negative thinking, fears, and doubts. Ellie would be wise to use her intuition to deal with her business. This card reflects attainment.

**Question 7:** Should I seek professional help?
**Answer:** 4 of Pentacles. Ellie needs a balanced attitude regarding money. If she feels she needs help, she should spend the money on herself. Ellie must look at truth and if it takes professional help, so be it!

**Question 8:** Do I have the confidence to confront these old patterns?
**Answer:** Hierophant (Reversed). At this time Ellie may not think she has the confidence, but this can change. She needs new information to help her grow and become a confident woman with faith in herself. Ellie has untapped inner resources and perhaps now is the time for her to become aware of her potential.

**Question 9:** What changes can I expect when I rid myself of these old habit patterns?
**Answer:** Queen of Cups. This Queen is powerful, intuitive, and intense. She desires control in her environment. Ellie can expect to be powerful, intense, and able to use her intuitive faculties. She can be in control of her life and make her own decisions. Then she can get in touch with her creative abilities.

**Question 10:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** Wheel of Fortune (Reversed). Ellie should not gamble or take risks at this time. No new ventures or serious relationships should be started now. Ellie needs to take care of her health and diet.

**Comment:** Ellie would be wise to seek professional help to become self-sufficient and in control of her life. She needs friends so she can enjoy herself away from work.

## INFORMATION SPREAD for the PAST—PRESENT—FUTURE

| Future | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Present | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| Past | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

----
The Past: These cards can refer to yesterday or several years ago, but the information still has an influence on the querent's life.
The Present: These cards refer to the querent's thoughts and beliefs now.
The Future: These cards represent the querent's subconscious mind. Events may happen immediately or within the next few months.

### TO BEGIN THIS SPREAD
Shuffle the cards and hand them to the querent. The querent should shuffle the cards and hand them back to you. They can cut the cards once, twice, or three times, whichever they prefer.

Place the first card face up on the first spot, beginning with the "Past" row, and then continue until all twelve cards have been laid out. Before you begin the reading, examine the spread. See which of the four elements are in the spread, check for repeat numbers (how many ones, twos, or threes, etc.) that appear in the spread. Also look at how many Major Arcana cards and Court cards are present. These indicate people involved with the querent. If there are many of these cards, this may indicate that there are too many people involved in the affairs of the querent. All of this information is helpful to you, the reader.

### TO READ THIS SPREAD
When you speak of the past, remember to use such past tenses and phrases as "in the past." For cards relating to the present, your sentences should begin with "now." Future information could begin with "in the future this or that may happen."

This spread will show you how this person is thinking and through the spread you will have the opportunity to provide them new information that may change their thoughts or beliefs. This is a responsibility for the reader due to the nature of the information. The reader must have integrity and confidence. Above all, treat everything lightly and enjoy your abilities as a reader!

# Chapter 8: SPIRITUAL SEEKERS

The different layouts are interesting to look at, and be sure to involve the querent in conversation during the readings. Try them out for yourself and see what interpretations you arrive at.

### READING
**Question 1:** How do I work with my physical and material concerns?
**Answer:** Emperor. Jenny realizes she is the boss, leader, and initiator of her actions. She is independent and has good ideas. Jenny works with her inner source to help her control her physical and material desires.

**Question 2:** How do I balance my desires?
**Answer:** 10 of Wands. Jenny balances her desires by refusing to accept the burdens of others. There are constant changes in Jenny's workplace and new people to deal with every day and she could have a lot of stress if she did not maintain this balance.

**Question 3:** Will I find a teacher soon?
**Answer:** High Priestess. This card infers that Jenny knows a great deal. She must listen to her inner source for guidance and then apply the knowledge. She must find her teacher within.


**Question 4:** What are the blocks to my enlightenment?
**Answer:** 8 of Swords (Reversed). Jenny does not feel she has the strength to overcome her problems and thinks she is in bondage. However, it is only a belief and can be changed at any time through meditation. The real problem could be fear of enlightenment and the ensuing responsibilities.

**Question 5:** What changes must I make now?
**Answer:** 7 of Pentacles. The mental path Jenny must take now is how to harvest the money she gets. She must not let her ego get in the way of her desire to be of service. Jenny might get in touch with her inner source and be guided to her wish.

**Question 6:** Do I have choices to make?
**Answer:** The Hermit (Reversed). Jenny has a lack of wisdom through her experiences. There could be fear or some insecurity that must be dealt with first. Jenny has choices to make, but they must be made with confidence and an open mind. She may not be in touch with her inner teacher at this time.

**Answer:** 6 of Wands. This is a card of victory! Jenny can be victorious by making right choices at work and socially. She must balance her desires and ego needs with faith in herself and her inner resources.

## Spiritual Aspiration for Lilly

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st position 2 of Pentacles (Reversed)
2nd position Knight of Swords
3rd position Wheel of Fortune
4th position Ace of Wands
5th position 9 of Swords (Reversed)
6th position 2 of Swords (Reversed)
7th position 4 of Wands

### READING
**Question 1:** How do I work with my physical and material concerns?

**Answer:** 2 of Pentacles (Reversed). Lilly feels she does not know how to handle money. She does not like to budget and she is materialistically focused. She likes to spend money on others as well as herself, so she is not greedy.

**Question 2:** How do I balance my desires?

**Answer:** Knight of Swords. Desires are overcome through realization. Lilly is a Leo and a very strong individual. She likes to help others who are not as strong or able as she. Lilly attracts people who have problems and then becomes embroiled in them herself. She has her own problems that she must attend to first. If Lilly would balance herself then she could be an example for others to follow.

**Question 3:** Will I find a teacher soon?
**Answer:** Wheel of Fortune. Now is the time for Lilly to make changes, to take a trip or a gamble. Let go of old ties—business or personal—that are a burden. Seek happiness during this peak period. Lilly should realize that life is experience and everything she does or has done makes her who she is today. Life has been her teacher and with the changes she makes she may find a teacher she could accept.

**Question 4:** What are the blocks to my enlightenment?
**Answer:** Ace of Wands. Lilly desires new beginnings in her work and social life. She wants excitement, pleasure, and relationships. Enlightenment comes through meditation, doing good works, and the inward search for one's source. When Lilly ends her focus on just the "outer" world she will begin her enlightenment.

**Question 5:** What changes must I make now?
**Answer:** 9 of Swords (Reversed). The changes Lilly must make include overcoming problems, trusting her intuition, and evaluating her experiences to gain wisdom. She must have faith in herself, meditate, and stop having great expectations that lead to disappointments. Leo is the sign of the ego, which must be controlled in spiritual work.

**Question 6:** Do I have choices to make?
**Answer:** 2 of Swords (Reversed). Since Lilly does not want to know or see her problems and troubles, she will continue to have them. She has a fear of seeing herself in a true light, which could give her freedom. Her illusory thinking about life and the world in which she lives gives her a materialistic focus, and she must choose between this and spiritual desires.

**Question 7:** Do I have enough faith in myself? Do I believe in a Higher Source?
**Answer:** 4 of Wands. Lilly realizes that her work and social activities are fruitful. She may desire marriage at this time rather than the pursuit of spiritual aspirations. She does not have as much faith in herself in relationships as she does in her work abilities. There is a possibility that she does believe in a Higher Source. But what she wants now is to buy a condominium!

**Comment:** Lilly is a stewardess and enjoys her work. She likes the excitement of going to foreign countries and meeting people. She is divorced but may want to get married again. She is not motivated to turn her full attention to spiritual work in the present.

### READING
**Question 1:** Who was I in my last life?
**Answer:** 7 of Swords (Reversed). Daniel was not happy in his last life. He was jealous, materially focused, and in relationships that were not positive. According to the cards in his spread, he had problems with work and money situations. Daniel may have been a woman (indicated by the presence of The Empress found in the 7th position of this spread).

**Question 2:** Was I married?
**Answer:** 5 of Wands (Reversed). This card shows the possibility that Daniel was married and they did not have a good relationship and he may not have fought for his rights. Daniel needed more faith and confidence in himself.

**Question 3:** Was I happy in this past life?
**Answer:** Hermit (Reversed). Daniel lacked wisdom or insight, was selfish and intolerant. He was focused on physical and material possessions. If he'd been happy, he would not have been greedy in his need for these things.

**Question 4:** What kind of work did I do in that life?
**Answer:** 2 of Cups. This card may indicate that Daniel sought marriage as a means to fulfill his life. If he was a female, that would have been the natural thing to do. Being a wife, mother, and nurturer would be the job during that period.

**Question 5:** Was I an honorable person?
**Answer:** Fool. This card would show that Daniel (in that life) was interested in new experiences, activity, and adventure and did not use his intelligence wisely. He may have been honorable, but others may have judged him harshly.

**Question 6:** What type of problems and challenges did I deal with?
**Answer.** Strength. Daniel had problems with leadership, controlling his passions, and resisting temptation. All of these things were challenges to his place in life. Daniel was also artistic and creative during that lifetime.

**Question 7:** Was I a famous person?
**Answer:** The Empress. This card would suggest that Daniel was a famous person, perhaps a female, and a powerful figure in that environment. Fame may have been Daniel's, but he was also creative, a communicator, and loving and nurturing.

**Question 8:** Was my health good during my past life?
**Answer:** 4 of Pentacles (Reversed). There may have been a lack of balance in Daniel's life and he may have been too busy enjoying himself. Excessive gambling and spending or money problems would have affected his health adversely.

**Question 9:** How did I die?
**Answer:** Page of Swords. This card indicates that Daniel might have died young by the sword or guillotine. He had many desires, was naive, unconventional, and extroverted. Daniel did not pay attention to his life and circumstances, and that may have cost him his life.

**Question 10:** Did I have a soul mate?
**Answer:** 2 of Pentacles. It appears that Daniel had a soul mate that tried to maintain a balance in money and health. If Daniel wanted material possessions, to live life to the fullest, or wanted new adventures constantly, the ability to juggle everything fell to the soul mate. The 2 of Cups and 2 of Pentacles in the spread could indicate a mate or close relationship.

**Question 11:** Is my present love relationship someone I knew during my past life?
**Answer:** 8 of Wands (Reversed). Daniel claims he does not have a love relationship at this time. He has had several involvements during this life but none that lasted. Perhaps he sensed some connection with past loves and fears repeating his experiences from his past life.

**Question 12:** Am I linked to my parents of today from my past life?
**Answer:** 6 of Wands. This card refers to making choices, being responsible and taking control of one's life. It states that Daniel made a choice about his parents in this life adventure. He can be victorious in his chosen work and social life.

**Question 13:** Are any other members of my family from a past life of mine?
**Answer:** 9 of Pentacles (Reversed). This card infers that some family members were connected through finances. Daniel is having to learn to work and take care of his own financial burdens. He cannot depend entirely on family, relationships, or others for support.

**Question 14:** What do I need to learn during this lifetime?
**Answer:** 9 of Cups. Daniel must use wisdom in his experiences. He will get his wish concerning his love and emotional needs. This is the "wish" card and when it appears upright, it means you will get your wish. Daniel must learn to love wisely, have self-confidence and self-esteem.

**Question 15:** Will I reincarnate after this life?
**Answer:** 9 of Wands (Reversed). Daniel feels that he would rather not. He does not like competition in the business world or in society, for he is more passive and would prefer to handle his affairs in a more spiritual way. With four of the number 9 cards present in this spread (including The Hermit) this may be his last trip into life.

**Comment:** It is all conjecture supported by very little proof, but there is information in our cells regarding past, present, and future. There are many reversed cards in Daniel's spread. It seems that he does not have a good memory regarding his past life. Work and money were issues for Daniel and it seems the same ones are happening to him again. What is the lesson, Daniel?

### READING
**Question 1:** Are there spirit guides for everyone?
**Answer:** 6 of Wands. The answer is yes for everyone who believes in spirit guides. Making decisions and winning is what this card is saying. Shirley is using her will and energy in positive ways mentally, physically, and emotionally. Perhaps she will contact her guides soon.

**Question 2:** How can I contact my spirit guides?
**Answer:** 7 of Pentacles (Reversed). It is possible that Shirley does not have enough faith in herself and she may be lacking confidence. Shirley is being positive in many ways, but her belief in spirit guides may not be included. Through meditation and concentration Shirley could contact her guides—it is a good way to get started.

**Question 3:** Will I make contact with my spirit guides soon?
**Answer:** The Hermit (Reversed). Shirley lacks wisdom through her experiences, can be closed minded and prejudiced. She must examine her fears in the event she contacts her guides as it could create problems for her mentally. Shirley must realize her guides are there to help, not injure her.

**Question 4:** Will we communicate mentally only?
**Answer:** 2 of Swords. Shirley says she knows about her spirit guides but she doesn't want to "see" them. She is not using her intuition, so things are not clear. If Shirley does not want to see her guides, when she does make contact, it can only be mentally.

**Question 5:** Have my spirit guides been with me always?
**Answer:** King of Wands (Reversed). The possibility is that your guides do not stay in one place all the time. This card is an Aries, and these people like to be on the go. It may be that Shirley has guides who like to play and have fun (Aries types can be like children). This could be a message for Shirley to lighten up.

**Question 6:** Will my guides give me information about my work, home matters, and relationships?
**Answer:** The Fool (Reversed). Shirley must take responsibility and balance pleasure, sexual needs, and the other desires in her life. Her guides will try to focus her attention on spiritual matters and let her make decisions about worldly issues.

**Question 7:** Can my guides teach me about other realities?
**Answer:** 10 of Wands (Reversed). Shirley must realize that her guides can teach her many things. She is seeking release from burdens in her professional and social lives but does not seem to be interested in spiritual information. Shirley feels this is a "fad" that will soon pass—but she is not right. Spirit is and will always be. The guides are with us if we acknowledge them.

**Question 8:** Do spirit guides appear in physical form?
**Answer:** The World. This card is called "Cosmic Consciousness." There is nothing that spirit guides cannot do. When miracles happen, the guides are involved. Usually, the guides are seen in consciousness, but who knows the truth? Shirley must have faith and trust.

**Question 9:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** Knight of Swords (Reversed). Shirley may not get any messages at this time regarding her spirit guides, but she should keep trying if she is sincere.

**Comment:** There are many new students in spiritual work and Shirley is one of them. Many are in a hurry to attain the knowledge others have spent years gathering. In time we shall all make the grade. Shirley will make it sooner or later.

### READING
**Question 1:** Are there spirit guides for everyone?
**Answer:** 5 of Swords. This card suggests that Penny does not believe in spirit guides. She desires to overcome others due to her own ego needs and this can lead to rash behavior on her part. Her mental attitude is not positive, and may bring empty victory.

**Question 2:** How can I contact my spirit guides?
**Answer:** Temperance. Penny must trust her inner source for guidance and have faith that she will be able to contact her own special guides—meditation is a very good way to do this. Patience is another virtue that Penny must cultivate as she balances her desires with wisdom.

**Question 3:** Will I make contact with my spirit guides soon?
**Answer:** The Chariot. This card indicates that now is the time to use one's mental powers to control destiny and be victorious. The Charioteer represents Penny's Higher Self and she must trust Him to guide her in all of her affairs. She must have faith that the source is within her and she will soon make contact.

**Question 4:** Will we communicate mentally only?
**Answer:** 7 of Wands (Reversed). Penny is too focused on her physical and material needs at this time. Her path is unclear and there is uncertainty about her future. There must be more faith and trust in the Higher Self in order to make any kind of contact—mentally or spiritually.

**Question 5:** Have my spirit guides been with me always?
**Answer:** 6 of Swords. Penny has a lack of knowledge or realization about her spirit guides. She is too focused on her problems and troubles and needs more faith in herself. Her Higher Self is always with her (as with all of us). Penny must acknowledge this Presence within her to realize It or They are there. Penny has a choice: run away from her problems and troubles or stay and see them through, knowing the Higher Self is helping her.

**Question 6:** Will my guides give me information about my work, home, and relationships?
**Answer:** 7 of Cups. This card indicates that through creative meditation it will lead her to correct responses. Her spirit guides are there to help her through all her experiences.

**Question 7:** Can my guides teach me about other realities?
**Answer:** 6 of Cups. Penny must make the choices about what she wants to know. She must be careful not to live in the past or focus her energies on past relationships. Penny has a world of knowledge within herself and her guides can give her this information if she has the ability to accept it.

**Question 8:** Do spirit guides appear in physical form?
**Answer:** Hanged Man (Reversed). Penny is easily fooled by others and she should be aware of living in fantasy or illusion. She does not have faith or trust in a Higher Self and wants visual proof of Its existence. This may not happen, but it does not mean the Higher Self does not exist.

**Question 9:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups. Penny realizes she lives in the past in her relationships. She must overcome depression and become aware that new opportunities await her. Old habit patterns must be discarded by her realization that she is the one in charge of her life, love, and emotional well-being.

**Comment:** Just as we take other things for granted we must be prepared to accept our inner guidance. Penny needs faith and trust in this concept. As it is said, "when the student is ready, the teacher appears."

### READING
**Question 1:** How do I contact my soul mate?
**Answer:** Justice. Meredith can contact her soul mate through acts of kindness, caring, and nurturing others. She must use discrimination in her experiences and treat others as she would like to be treated. Meditation and creative visualization are good ways to do this. Meredith must have faith in her inner source and then she will succeed in contacting her soul mate.

**Question 2:** Is my soul mate in the physical world now?
**Answer:** 3 of Pentacles. This card refers to the physical world (pentacles)—indicating the possibility of Meredith's soul mate being in the world at this time. The 3 of Pentacles speaks of a master craftsman—artistic and good at what they do. They have faith in their abilities and making money through their work. Meredith needs to get busy with her visualization now!

**Question 3:** Is it possible to communicate with my soul mate now?
**Answer:** Queen of Wands (Reversed). This card reversed depicts a Leo man. Anytime Meredith is ready, she can begin to contact her soul mate. Through meditation and creative visualization Meredith will be able to make this contact in a matter of weeks if she is persistent!

**Question 4:** What can I do to bring my soul mate into my life?
**Answer:** 4 of Pentacles (Reversed). Meredith must put herself in a balanced state. She may be a spendthrift, a gambler with a need to understand the value of money. Meredith may be involved with negative experiences that she must change, or possibly find herself dealing with health issues. Her beliefs need to be altered and her thinking directed into positive channels.

**Question 5:** Is my soul mate a free spirit?
**Answer:** 3 of Cups. The answer is yes. This soul mate is happy, has good times, and desires to travel. The soul mate is creative through the arts, music, and literature. Meredith could learn a great deal from her soul mate about enjoyment in life.

**Question 6:** Have we been in relationships in the past?
**Answer:** The Sun (Reversed). The Sun card is Leo, a sign also seen in question 3. If there was a past encounter it was not positive. Reversed, this card speaks of dishonesty, a lack of courage, and low self-esteem. Whether this information relates to Meredith or her soul mate, it does not show a great relationship. Meredith probably was not in a relationship with her soul mate in the past.

**Question 7:** Do I need to study or learn anything about soul mates?
**Answer:** 3 of Swords. Meredith may study and learn about anything that interests her. If her friends are into soul mates and she is jealous of them, she can follow the crowd. Meredith should know, however, that she makes her own problems and doing spiritual work can create more problems for her than she realizes. It would be healthier to know something about "higher knowledge."

**Question 8:** Will there be harmony and well-being between us?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups (Reversed). Meredith feels she will be disappointed in this relationship with her soul mate. She is inexperienced in relationships and does not have much faith or trust in them. There can be harmony and well-being if Meredith will relax and be confident that her soul mate cares about her.

**Question 9:** How can I learn to love and accept my soul mate?
**Answer:** 10 of Wands (Reversed). Meredith must make changes in her life. She feels stagnant both at work and in her social life and is looking for alternatives. If her life is dull, does she expect her soul mate to make her world thrilling? Meredith must evaluate her expectations and decide whether she is ready to accept her soul mate honestly.

**Question 10:** What changes can I make while I wait for my soul mate?
**Answer:** King of Pentacles (Reversed). Meredith must overcome some negative traits within herself such as selfishness and being lazy and impractical. She could learn to be honest, less stubborn, and more loving. Having more faith and trust in herself would also help.

**Question 11:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** 8 of Wands. Meredith has the strength to do all of the things suggested by this reading. She can work and have the active social life she seeks. The more positively she thinks and believes, the quicker her soul mate will arrive.

**Comment:** Creative visualization and meditation are two keys to success. A few minutes a day, every day, will bring your heart's desire to you. Meredith must be serious about wanting her soul mate in her life. If she is, she will prove it by using some of her time in meditation or creative visualization every day. Positive thinking and your beliefs manifest your life. Do it and reap your rewards now!

10th  position   King of Swords
11th  position   3 of Wands

### READING
**Question 1:** How do I contact my soul mate?
**Answer:** 2 of Pentacles. Josey must learn to balance her physical and material needs with her spiritual values. She must keep herself healthy and have faith in herself. The contact between Josey and her soul mate will occur when she is ready and balanced.

**Question 2:** Is my soul mate in the physical world now?
**Answer:** Ace of Cups (Reversed). According to this card, Josey is not receptive to the appearance of her soul mate. She is emotionally unstable, feels drained, and is quarreling with family members. This is not a time for new beginnings in love or new relationships.

**Question 3:** Is it possible to communicate with my soul mate now?
**Answer:** 3 of Cups. Communication with Josey's soul mate is possible and it will make her happy to make this contact. This can be an upbeat time for her, and getting involved with her creative side would be beneficial rather than the negative experiences that are happening to her through family members.

**Question 4:** What can I do to bring my soul mate into my life?
**Answer:** 3 of Pentacles (Reversed). Josey lacks faith in her abilities. Money will not bring her soul mate into her life experience. Josey must be happy, enjoying life, and feeling that life is worthwhile. She must believe that it is possible to encounter her soul mate.

**Question 5:** Is my soul mate a free spirit?
**Answer:** Queen of Swords. This Queen is independent, alone, and seeking a relationship. In this position, this card could indicate that Josey's soul mate is a passive, loving, and caring individual, while Josey is more aggressive and independent. Perhaps Josey can learn to control her aggression and spend more time exploring her feminine side.

**Question 6:** Have we been in relationships in the past?
**Answer:** Knight of Wands. This card indicates that Josey and her soul mate have communicated with each other, either in the past or in the present. This would show that they have had a relationship.

**Question 7:** Do I need to study or learn anything about soul mates?
**Answer:** The Hermit. Josey must learn to trust and respect herself and then she will be closer to encountering her soul mate. She would be wise to seek her inner teacher for spiritual guidance. Meditation can also help her contact her soul mate.

**Question 8:** Will there be harmony and well-being between us?
**Answer:** 2 of Cups (Reversed). Josey knows that she fears commitment and being hurt in love. She is not trusting and this has created emotional problems in her relationships. If there is no trust in a relationship, there is no need for that relationship, except to learn from it. How can there be harmony or well-being if there is no love or trust?

**Question 9:** How can I learn to love and accept my soul mate?
**Answer:** Ace of Swords. Josey must learn to love and accept herself first. Understanding herself is her first lesson and will change her beliefs. If she focuses her attention on her soul mate she is neglecting herself. Josey lacks trust—a main ingredient in a relationship. This card can show a loss, not a good beginning for a romantic relationship.

**Question 10:** What changes can I make while I wait for my soul mate?
**Answer:** King of Swords. Josey must use discrimination in deciding about changes. She must not get too emotionally involved with her family or other relationships. By maintaining her balance and learning to love, and respecting herself, she can attract her soul mate. She can make these changes by altering her beliefs and watching her thought patterns.

**Question 11:** Final outcome?
**Answer:** 3 of Wands. Creative visualization is a method that Josey could use to change her thinking. She is very creative and makes her professional and social lives. Now Josey needs to seek inner guidance for future plans that include her soul mate. New ideas will bring success and happiness to Josey if she believes in herself.

**Comment:** Josey is a Leo, sign of the ego. She becomes disappointed when her expectations do not turn out the way she wants them to. She is very creative and works at a job she loves. Josey has family problems and relationship blues—but problems are opportunities for growth and we must accept our experiences in a positive manner.

## Wish Spread for Lorna

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD

1st position Ace of Pentacles (Reversed)
2nd position Fool
3rd position Hanged Man
4th position 2 of Pentacles (Reversed)
5th position Emperor (Reversed)
6th position 7 of Swords
7th position Hierophant (Reversed)

### READING
**Question 1:** What is my wish?
**Answer:** Ace of Pentacles (Reversed). Lorna is involved in her neighborhood watch program and is very unhappy with the circumstances involved. She feels there will be no new beginnings regarding the problem and that it will not go away. Lorna also feels that the property values in her neighborhood are affected by the undesirables who roam the streets where she lives. The thought of moving has occurred to Lorna, but this card says "no new beginnings with money," which would make moving into a new area at this time unlikely.

**Question 2:** Do I feel I deserve my wish?
**Answer:** Fool. Lorna's wish is to have others participate as much as she does, but this is a vain hope. She deserves to have support from her neighbors because they are also at risk. Lorna has a full-time job and a fourteen-year-old son at home, which keeps her quite busy.

**Question 3:** Forces opposing my wish?

**Answer:** Hanged Man. Lorna feels she must dedicate a lot of time policing the immediate area and attending meetings, but does not think that others are doing their share. She is sacrificing her will to the desires of others and this is making her ill. Lorna must keep her balance through meditation and creative visualization.

**Question 4:** Forces working for me to help attain my wish?
**Answer:** 2 of Pentacles (Reversed). Lorna is depressed because she would like to move. Her financial affairs will not allow her to do so at this time. What Lorna must understand is that she must work out this problem where she is and not take it with her if she does move. This card indicates a person who does not know how to budget money. Either Lorna is a spendthrift or her husband handles their financial affairs. Money and health balance each other, and we all benefit from this balance.

**Question 5:** Are there changes I must make to get my wish?
**Answer:** Emperor (Reversed). Lorna does not realize that she is good material for being the leader, authority figure, and spokesperson for her neighborhood. It is natural for most people to let the other person do it. Lorna should not let resentment, fear, or immature thinking cloud her vision. Perhaps a meeting and an election would stimulate her neighbors to take a larger share in the watch program.

**Question 6:** Is this wish in my best interest?
**Answer:** 7 of Swords. This card shows the path to mental thinking and control. It refers to problems and troubles that Lorna creates for herself, which are temporary. Their house has been burglarized twice and Lorna feels uncomfortable whenever she is away. Her belief system is attracting her experiences but she is reluctant to accept the responsibility for events. She is capable of being the spokeswoman for the neighborhood watch program, but the choice is hers. Lorna would know what is going on if she stayed with the group and that would be in her best interest.

**Question 7:** Outcome?
**Answer:** Hierophant (Reversed). Lorna does not believe in an inner source. She is a Cancer and desires safety, security, and survival. This is a materialistic view and rarely satisfies the soul. Meditation and creative visualization could be the answer to her prayers if she would only try.

**Comment:** Lorna is a school psychologist and along with her job she has a husband, a son, and her big house to take care of. She may be pushing to move although she loves her home. Most of her friends live in a different area—perhaps this factor is the most important clue of all! There are four Major Arcana cards in this spread, which may indicate that four individuals play an important role in Lorna's life at this time. With faith, Lorna may get her wish and move!

6th   position   7 of Swords 
7th   position   Hierophant (Reversed) 

### READING
**Question 1:** What is my wish?
**Answer:** 4 of Cups. Fred realizes his ability to love and that he must balance his emotions. Fred is a Scorpio, a water sign, and very intense. There is constant turmoil in his life between his business and his family. Looking at the cards in this spread we see the focus is on love and emotional needs on one hand, and business on the other. Fred's wish is for balance in all areas. There is a tendency to hang on to past experiences that he must release now to get his wish.

**Question 2:** Do I feel I deserve my wish?
**Answer:** 2 of Wands. Fred knows his work and how to get along socially. He has the world in his hands. He is a successful businessman and his wife and sister are both involved in the business. Fred feels he deserves his good fortune and strives for balance all the time.

**Question 3:** Forces opposing my wish?
**Answer:** Moon. On some level, Fred will not face the truth. His wife and sister are in competition for his affections and this is creating problems. He needs to use his psychic abilities (water sign) to maintain peace and harmony between these two. Fred might be swayed first one way and then the other by his own emotional needs. The Moon card also refers to Fred's mother. Fred and his sister lost their mother when they were very young. This has created an emotional bond between brother and sister, which would be difficult to break. Attainment is also a reachable goal for Fred.

**Question 4:** Forces working for me to help attain my wish?
**Answer:** Ace of Cups (Reversed). Fred may feel a little unstable but he will not have any new beginnings in emotional affairs. He may not be aware of his emotions being drained either. Fred's business is becoming more and more successful, so there are material forces helping him to victory.

**Question 5:** Are there changes I must make to get my wish?
**Answer:** 3 of Cups (Reversed). This card tells us that Fred does not make himself happy in love. He is having difficulty in his relationships and it is causing an emotional drain, some depression, and the potential for loss. Perhaps Fred feels lonely due to the problems with his family. The initial change Fred could make is to be happy and count his blessings. The women in his life will have to work out their problems of jealousy and resentment without his help.

**Question 6:** Is this wish in my best interest?
**Answer:** 7 of Cups. This card refers to victory in love. If Fred keeps his mental control, the balance he is seeking will happen. Fred has a good imagination and through his creative thinking he has found success. Fred's success has brought him material well-being from which his wife and sister naturally benefit. So, while his business has helped everyone materially, it doesn't always help emotionally.

**Question 7:** Outcome?
**Answer:** 7 of Wands. Fred must take the mental path, which speaks of control, in his work and social activities. Victory and balance are then assured in both directions. He must rely on his own judgment, but not act egotistically or feel superior. Success will continue and balance will save the day!

**Comment:** Fred has worked very hard for his success and his wife and sister have been instrumental in helping him achieve it. Perhaps it is good that Fred travels a good deal for this business. As long as each person is getting some of their ego needs met, everything will be fine. Pulling together would make success even sweeter.

### READING
**Question 1:** What is my wish?
**Answer:** 3 of Pentacles. Ken is a lawyer. He makes money because he is good at what he does. He feels he is a master craftsman and very creative. Ken's wish is to remain productive and take care of his family's needs and his own.

**Question 2:** Do I feel I deserve my wish?
**Answer:** 10 of Cups. Ken is having some change in his love and emotional state. This is Ken's second marriage and new family. If there is joy in the home then Ken feels he deserves his wish. His children from his first marriage are all adults and able to take care of their own needs.

**Question 3:** Forces opposing my wish?
**Answer:** Queen of Swords (Reversed). This Queen has problems and troubles but may not wish to confront them. She has been married but is now divorced. This is Ken's sister who does not care for Ken's new wife and tries to create trouble between them. Ken tries to maintain a balance with these two women and is not always successful. There is a certain amount of jealousy involved as Ken's new wife is much younger than Ken. Fortunately, Ken knows his sister well and understands that she is a manipulator.

**Question 4:** Forces working for me to help attain my wish?
**Answer:** Page of Cups (Reversed). This Page shows an emotional drain and many disappointments—but also great expectations. Ken has three children from his first marriage and his son was constantly in trouble. Now Ken has a second son who is very young and lovable. This boy may be the force that is working for Ken to help him attain his wish.

**Question 5:** Are there changes I must make to get my wish?
**Answer:** Page of Pentacles (Reversed). This Page is not interested in getting an education, setting goals, or learning how to earn money to be independent. This could refer to the older son who wants the easy life, dislikes authority, and has been involved with drugs. Changes that Ken must make concern this son. Perhaps he feels rejected by Ken since he was young when his parents divorced. Showing love to this son may create the changes Ken needs to get his wish and also help the young man.

**Question 6:** Is this wish in my best interest?

**Answer:** 5 of Wands (Reversed). Ken feels that he has been very fortunate in his life. He does not appear as confident now and is afraid that his relationship will not remain as happy as it has been. Ken's ideas about work and the social scene have changed and his beliefs are also different. His wish for financial success is positive and by affirming prosperity his circumstances should not change. Ken's health has been good and by keeping a positive outlook, it should remain so.

**Question 7:** Outcome?
**Answer:** Page of Wands. This Page is eager to experience work and social activities. The Page is headstrong, desires freedom, and is independent. Ken said this described one of his daughters whom he is very proud of. His other daughter has turned out fine, as well. Ken realizes he has another chance with his young son and hopes to do a better job this time.

**Comment:**
It is difficult to start raising a child when the parent is in his fifties. Many people are having second families as a way to stay young minded. Ken loves all of his children, but was not always there to cater to their needs. When parents and children have high expectations for each other it is a set-up for disappointment. All a person can do is try to do the best that they can, which Ken feels he is doing.

7th    position      Queen of Wa nds 
8th    position      High Priestess 

### READING

**Question 1:** What is the question?
**Answer:** 9 of Cups. This is the wish card and it is upright, which indicates Polly will get her wish. It also shows that Polly has gained wisdom through her experiences. She relies on her inner teacher (Hermit) and is guided by the Light. Her question pertains to going into partnership with her friend. Polly has tried several times to work with female partners but has never been successful. She realizes this problem stems from her relationship with her mother. Polly needs to find a man to partner with and even that may not work out.

**Question 2:** How is it affecting you?
**Answer:** 5 of Wands. Polly and her friend each want their own way in this venture. They each believe they have the best way to do things at work and socially.
This ego focus could cause problems. She is constantly finding fault with her friend, which is not a good sign.

**Question 3: Obstacles to overcome?**
**Answer:** Hierophant (Reversed). Polly does not wish to follow any rules or regulations in her venture. She is a rebel and desires to do things her way and could be putting stumbling blocks in her own path with this attitude. Polly wants to control all aspects of her venture and having a partner may not be the answer.

**Question 4: The past experiences regarding the question?**
**Answer:** Wheel of Fortune (Reversed). Polly should not gamble or take chances with her venture. In the past she had partners and felt they all took advantage of her. She still believes that she will attract someone who will do the same thing to her now. With this belief, she should not get involved with a partner of any kind.

**Question 5: The present thoughts regarding the question?**
**Answer:** 4 of Swords. Polly must realize that she should rest and meditate on her problems. She needs to put herself in balance and realize she is creating her own experiences. Her ego is driving her and she must recognize this fact. There is also a jealous factor in the three swords hanging over the figure and she is creating these problems herself.

**Question 6:** What will occur in the future?
**Answer:** 7 of Pentacles. The mental path to money. This shows Polly that she can have money and will have to make decisions about what to do with it. Polly's ego was a problem in the past. The money may come suddenly and she needs to be prepared.

**Question 7:** Will I need professional advice?
**Answer:** Queen of Wands. Polly wants to do it all herself. She must seek legal counsel for her new venture if she wants to protect herself and her product. This card indicates the ego in work and social life. Polly wants to be a star, to be admired and praised. If this card represents the partner, Polly must proceed with caution!

**Question 8:** Outcome? (Will this problem affect my finances?)
**Answer:** High Priestess. The High Priestess says "I know." This card indicates that Polly has the answer to her question within her. She is intelligent and if she does not let her need for money or her ego get in the way, success is assured.

**Comment:** Polly would like to change her occupation. Her new venture looks promising and could make her a winner. She must follow legal procedure, even if she is a rebel. The future looks bright for her.

## Yes or No for Darla

### CARDS IN THE SPREAD
1st  position  4 of Pentacles (Reversed)
2nd  position  8 of Pentacles (Reversed)
3rd  position  Chariot (Reversed)
4th  position  5 of Pentacles
5th  position  7 of Cups (Reversed)
6th  position  10 of Pentacles (Reversed)
7th  position  6 of Swords (Reversed)
8th  position  Justice

### READING
**Question 1:** What is the question?
**Answer:** 4 of Pentacles (Reversed). There is a lack of balance in Darla's mental attitude. Her sense of money is also out of balance, although she is not greedy. Her thinking is materially based and not especially spiritual. Her question concerned her job and if she would still be working in the same place in September.

**Question 2:** How is it affecting you?
**Answer:** 8 of Pentacles (Reversed). Darla feels she is working with cheaters and dishonest people and she senses a lack of strength within herself to deal with them. Darla is trying to put her finances in better shape, so she needs the job. Health problems can arise if she feels powerless, but Darla is a strong Scorpio and very capable of holding her own in most situations.

**Question 3:** Obstacles to overcome?
**Answer:** Chariot (Reversed). This card refers to the material path. Darla may feel she is not in control of her desires or finances. She may not be aware of her inner source who is there to guide her if she has the faith. Darla may not feel secure or nurtured at this time.

**Question 4:** The past experiences regarding the question?
**Answer:** 5 of Pentacles. Darla believed in money and made it her god. This is a crippling belief and does not show a prosperity mind. However, she has put this belief in her past and has learned through experience that it is not healthy. Darla is good at what she does and need not fear losing her job.

**Question 5** Your present thought regarding the question?
**Answer:** 7 of Cups (Reversed). Darla is emotionally drained due to a conflict that took place at work. Perhaps if Darla were to creatively visualize herself starting the new semester in September, she would feel more secure and assured about her teaching job.

**Question 6:** What will occur in the future?

**Answer:** 10 of Pentacles (Reversed). There are no changes in the money department for Darla. She is working and understands that she must cut back on her desires and pay off her bills. This could take some pressure off and stop the worries in the future.

**Question 7:** Will I need professional advice?
**Answer:** 6 of Swords (Reversed). Darla may need to employ a lawyer, but not at this time. Darla is not making choices right now and she must stay and face her problems. She must also use her mind to analyze her problems and troubles and not allow others to make decisions for her.

**Question 8:** Outcome? (Will this problem affect my finances?)
**Answer:** Justice. Yes, it could affect her finances. Darla may need legal advice (scales of Justice), or she just wants to be treated fairly. If there is a legal suit, it is likely she would win.

**Comment:** Darla has four pentacle cards in her spread, which shows money is a prime factor in her life. She also has many reversed cards. These are not all negative, but to have so many in a spread has much meaning. Darla must change some of her beliefs in order to change her life. Meditation helps to root out negative habit patterns and Darla would benefit greatly from this.

----
A. Is this a good day to buy a ticket on the lottery?
B. Obstacles to overcome?
C. Querent's mental attitude toward winning the lottery.
1 through 6: These cards will provide the numbers to play in the lottery.

## TO USE THIS SPREAD
For this spread, you will use only the twenty-two Major Arcana cards. After you have separated them from the rest of the deck, shuffle the cards. Place one card face up in the A position, another on B, and a third on C. If a card falls in a reversed position, read it that way. If the cards are negative, end the reading at this point and try another day. If the cards are positive, continue with the reading.

Then, in boxes 1 through 6, place three cards in each position, face up. These are the lottery numbers. One card will remain; this will be read at the end of the session.

After you have read the cards on A, B, and C, you are ready to start on box 1. Pick up the three cards in this position and add the numbers of the cards together. Do not reduce the number values of any cards. If the total is over the limit of the lottery, stop the reading and try another day.

**Example:** Box 1 may contain The Moon, Hierophant, and Justice.

| Card Name  | Number |
| ---------- | ------ |
| The Moon   | 18     |
| Hierophant | 5      |
| Justice    | 11     |
| **Total**  | **34** |


The amount of this box would be 34, which is within the number range of the lottery.
Pick up the three cards on Box 2 and add them in the same way. Repeat this with the rest of the boxes, adding each box separately. When you are finished, there will be a total for each of the six boxes. Next, turn over the last card to get the final message. The application of the final card is up to you. If it is a low numbered card—The Magician (1) or High Priestess (2)—you may wish to substitute it for one of the six numbers gained through adding the Major Arcana cards in the six piles of the reading. Because you have added the values of the numbers in these piles, it is impossible to play a 1 or 2 in the lottery simply using those numbers.

If the totals in each of the six boxes are within lottery limits, go buy a ticket. Do not wait for another day—do it now!

Remember, when the cards are in the boxes numbered 1 through 6, they can be upright or reversed. When the cards are in boxes A, B, C, they must be read the way they are found—upright or reversed—on the box.

### READING:
**Question 1:** Is this a good day to buy a ticket on the lottery?
**Answer:** The Devil (Reversed). Arlene is not as greedy for material possessions or as selfish as some others, but there is a block in her thinking that refuses to allow her the better things in life.

**Question 2:** Obstacles to overcome?
**Answer:** Sun (Reversed). Arlene has a lack of courage or confidence. She must learn to be open and honest with others, which builds trust and respect. Arlene places too much emphasis on the physical-sexual side of her life. This is the time to overcome past habit patterns of thought and learn to love oneself.

**Question 3:** Querent's mental attitude toward winning the lottery.
**Answer:** The Fool (Reversed). With this mental attitude Arlene is sabotaging her desires. She must balance her actions, pleasures, sexual needs, and selfishness by having faith in herself. If Arlene does not feel she deserves to win the lottery, how will she do it?

Box 1 Total — 25
Box 2 Total — 43
Box 3 Total — 27
Box 4 Total — 19
Box 5 Total — 38
Box 6 Total — 37

Because the final card of Arlene's reading was Strength, with a numerological value of 8, the number was disregarded and she played he six numbers from the boxes. However, it does indicate that she has the strength to overcome all obstacles and changer her life for the better.

Arlene bought a ticket on Saturday. Her reading was done on Thursday. She did not win anything.
Comment: Buy a ticket on the day you put out a positive spread. Good Luck!
