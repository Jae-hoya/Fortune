seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_king_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## KING OF PENTACLES
The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it.
Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of lifes sweetness - decorating his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it.
A Tarot reading once produced the Fool crossed by the King of Pentacles (the two cards greatly resemble each other in their colour schemes). The conjunction forms a fine example of what I call vertical and horizontal time, that is, the inner and outer worlds. The King symbolizes ordinary activity, accomplishments, social position, success, while the Fool stands for the inner spiritual freedom that allows a person to enjoy these things and build upon them without getting trapped in a narrow materialist view. Consider two people with the same outer worlds - both successful, respected, wealthy; yet inwardly one may be tense, or frustrated, or afraid, while the other remains joyful and at peace.
If we see the Fool as the beginning of the Major Arcana, the King of Pentacles as the final card of the Minor, then the two stand at opposite ends of the Tarot. But this polarity holds true only if we see the cards in a line. If we envision them in a circle, then the Fool and the King of Pentacles become joined together.","### Reversed

The King is meant for success. Reversing him suggests failure or simply mediocrity. The lack of fulfilment brings dissatisfaction, feelings of weakness, and doubt. Taken another way we can see the upside down King as symbolizing the idea of success corrupted, the image of a man or a woman who will use any means to achieve his or her goals.

If we describe the King of Pentacles as someone who needs a vital connection with nature (and not everyone does, despite contemporary assumptions), the King reversed stands for the state of being cut off from that rejuvenating flow. Here too the break results in dissatisfaction, weakness, even psychic danger.",King of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,383,2125
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_queen_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## QUEEN OF PENTACLES
Where the King sits before a castle, the Queens throne stands entirely in a field, framed by roses. Where the King simply glances at his Pentacle, the Queen holds hers in both hands, intensely aware of the magic in nature and the strength she derives from it. More than any other Minor card she represents a love for and unity with the world. The rabbit in the lower right-hand corner stands not only for sexual fertility, but also for the spiritual fruitfulness of a life that has found its own rhythm in the world around it.
Her qualities, as well as the sexual symbolism, relate her to the patron of Pentacles, the Empress. At the same time, as a Minor figure she carries a quality lacking in the archetypal trump of passion: self-awareness. She knows and believes in herself, and in the magic of her life. In readings, this quality of self-trust will often prove the most important.
If the King stands beside the Fool then the Queen belongs with the Magician. Like him she wears a red robe over a white shirt; leaves and flowers frame both of them; a yellow sky shines behind each. Where the Magician manipulates the forces hidden in the world, the Queen of Pentacles joins herself to those forces, allowing them to flow through her into her daily life.","### REVERSED

In readings, the Queen reversed can mean not trusting oneself in some specific situation. More generally it refers to psychic weakness. For cutting off the Queen from her vital connection to the earth results, even more so than with the King, in nervousness and confusion. She becomes afraid, even phobic, mistrustful of others and especially of herself, doubting her abilities and her value as a person. This separation means more than being isolated from plants and animals. Rather it means a loss of daily rhythm in life, a dissatisfaction with the whole environment, and an inability to appreciate what the environment has to offer.

In a reading the Queen reversed not only points out these qualities in the subject, but suggests a dual remedy. First, a build up in confidence; besides emphasizing his or her accomplishments and good qualities a person can do this through meditation with the Queen right side up. Second, a grounding of the emotions in natural things, ordinary pleasures, satisfying work.",Queen of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,229,1279
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_knight_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## Knight OF PENTACLES
The Knights responsibility for action brings out the suits practical qualities. At the same time, denying the Knights natural penchant for adventure tends to distort and narrow his attitude to life. He is responsible, hardworking, uncomplaining. In his best sense he is deeply rooted to the outer world and to simplicity, a quality suggested by the way his horse stands firmly on the ground, with its rider sitting upright.
Though he also holds a pentacle he does not look at it, but instead stares over it. The symbolism suggests that he has lost sight of the source and meaning of his strength in life. In dedicating himself to purely practical matters, he has cut himself off from the deeper things in Earth.","### Reversed

Sometimes the Knight reversed can mean an awakening of those other awarenesses. More often it shows a failure — or exaggeration — of the Knight’s more obvious virtues. His steadiness slows down to the point of inertia, his plodding responsibility gives way to idleness. A mild personality, taken just a little too far, becomes weak and depressed, especially if his placidity has covered a repressed desire for either adventure or greater advancement.

The Knight of Pentacles reversed can sometimes indicate a crisis. If a person has dedicated her or his life to a job or some similar outer responsibility, and that meaning is taken away — say through dismissal or retirement — then discouragement and depression can overcome him or her. Another example would be a woman who has dedicated her life to her children and now finds that they have grown up and away from her.

Though such extreme meanings of course occur rarely in actual readings, they remain implied in the Knight’s basic paradox: deeply grounded in, yet unaware of, the magic beneath him, he identifies himself with his functions. He needs to discover the real source of his strength, within himself and in life.",Knight of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,126,734

In direct contrast to the Knight, the Page looks at nothing but his pentacle, holding it lightly in the air. Where the Knight is the prototypical worker, the Page represents the student, lost in his studies, fascinated, feeling little concern for anything outside them. Nevertheless, he partakes of the suits practical nature by symbolizing the actual work of the student, the study and scholarship, as compared to the inspiration symbolized by the Page of Cups.
The student here acts as a symbol; the Page need not refer to someone actually in school, but simply anyone approaching any activity with those qualities of fascination, of involvement, of caring less for rewards or social position than for the work itself.","### Reversed

Again, the Page appears as the converse of the Knight. In reality, the two of them split the Pentacles' double qualities—practicality and magic. Where the Knight, without his job, becomes discouraged and inert, the Page, without his sense of hard work, gives way to wildness and dissipation, what Waite calls 'prodigality'.

seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_ten_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## TEN OF PENTACLES
One of the most symbolic and deeply-layered Minor cards, the Ten shows us the very image of the Gate opening to hidden experience in ordinary things. Like the Ten of Cups it deals with domestic life, but where the men and women in Cups celebrate the gift, the family here does not notice the magic all around them. On the surface the card represents the established home, the good life, a secure and comfortable position in the world. The people concerned, however, appear to take the comfort for granted; they find the security boring or stifling. In contrast to the Ten of Cups (the two cards will often appear together in readings) the family here does not seem to communicate with each other. The man and woman face opposite ways, though the woman glances anxiously over her shoulder at the man. The child hangs on nervously to its mother, but looks away. And none of them notices the old man outside the arch.
Though the card expresses mundaneness, magic signs cover it. The ten pentacles form the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, something which appears nowhere else in the deck. Notice also the magic wand resting against the arch; no other Minor card contains one. The arch itself bears a relief of balanced scales (just above the old man's head). Now, scales stand for Justice, and further, for subtle forces which keep the everyday world from breaking into chaos. By 'subtle forces' I do not mean only so-called 'occult' laws, such as polarity, or the law of correspondences (as above, so below). The term applies also to nature's generally more accepted workings, such as gravity, or electro-magnetism. Because we learn about these in school we should not consider such phenomena as any the less marvellous. The fact is, we all take the universe for granted simply because it works so well.
Even more than the other images, the old man evokes magic. He resembles the image, from every culture, of the god or angel who comes disguised as a beggar or traveller to visit some family, test their virtues of hospitality and generosity, and then leave them a magical gift. In the case of Abraham and Sarah the angels gave them a son, Isaac. In many such stories only the dogs recognize the visitor (just as in other tales the dogs alone run from the Devil when he comes in disguise). Because they have not buried their instincts in blasé human rationalism, the dogs can sense the wonderful when it comes to call.
Now, most of these tales emphasize the moral 'Be nice to everyone. You never know whom you might turn away'. But we can give the story a more subtle interpretation. By acting a certain way, people create in themselves the ability to recognize and receive the blessings in the world around them.
All these hidden signs and wonders point up the basic theme of Pentacles: the everyday world contains a magic greater than any of us can usually see. The magic is all around us, in nature, in the very fact that life exists and that this vast universe does not fly apart.
Inside the arch we see a bright ordinary day; outside darker tones prevail, even in the old man's coat of many colours, with its signs of astrology and ritual magic. The family stand under the arch posed as in a play. For all its firm reality, the everyday world, the comfortable lives we take for granted, and even the troubles and miseries that often occupy our minds, are only a play, in which we all follow the parts set out for us by our upbringing and by society (the recognition that we are a product of our conditioning is the first step to freeing ourselves from it).
The true reality remains ancient, dark, and mysterious. Though we look through the arch the perspective of the card places us outside it, with the mysterious visitor. By merging with this card we can find ourselves beyond the Gate, looking in at the little dramas of our own daily lives. By going further with it we can experience that wild vibrant universe existing in the very centre of the ordinary.
When the hero Odysseus arrived home from his wanderings in the wild, monster-ridden world outside civilized Greece, he came disguised as a beggar. Only his dog recognized him. Though he wore rags, they were glorious rags (much like the visitors patchwork coat) for the goddess Athena had given them to him. Odysseus returned to the domestic world from the wild; he destroyed the evil in his house and re-established the moral order. Yet first he had to experience what lay beyond. The Ten of Pentacles takes us there as well.","### REVERSED

If the sense of boredom with life increases it can lead to taking risks, especially financial or emotional ones. Sometimes, depending on the contexts or the projected results, the risks are justified; for instance, the Fool beside the Ten of Pentacles would urge the gamble. At other times the risks come less from need than from impatience with what we already have. This situation becomes more pointed when the Ten of Pentacles appears with the Ten of Cups.

The parallel with Odysseus stands out when the card becomes reversed. Most of that hero’s troubles arose because of a streak of recklessness that made him do wild things at just the wrong moment. The urge to gamble stood in opposition to his basic qualities of caution, skill, and foresight. And yet the wildness maintained the balance. Without it Odysseus would not have seen the world beyond the home and family to which he finally returned.",Ten of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,796,4502
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_nine_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## NINE OF PENTACLES
As material cards, Pentacles deal with success and what it means in a person's life. Unlike the figure in Ten, the woman here is sharply aware of the good things in her life. Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card's basic meanings, especially self-awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success-but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive.
'Success' here means not so much worldly achievement as success in 'creating' ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And 'certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty.
We have seen that the Nines show compromises and choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this symbolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.
The image in Fig. 72(b), slightly different from the official Rider version (Fig. 72(a)), comes from an American edition of several years ago. In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the womans face, as well as the grapes on the cards right-hand side. Clearly she is turning away from the sun. The symbolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development.
The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars.","### Reversed

The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what we want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as ourselves.",Nine of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,475,2766
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_eight_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## Eight OF PENTACLES
The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.
Work, whether physical, artistic, or spiritual (the Sufi Idries Shah speaks of 'work' as the most basic of Sufi doctrines), cannot succeed if the person thinks only of the end result. Many artists and writers have testified to this fact, warning hopefuls that if they just want to become famous or rich they will never succeed. We have to care about the work itself.
Therefore we see the apprentice lost in his task. And yet work also needs to be related to the outside world. However much we follow our standards and instincts or seek our own development the work we do lacks meaning if it does not serve the community. Therefore, behind his shop-though far away-stands a city, with a yellow road (yellow for mental action) leading to and from the workshop.","### REVERSED

When reversed the card suggests primarily impatience and the situations resulting from it: frustration, unfulfilled ambition, envy or jealousy. These things may result from the attitude of looking only to success, and not to the work that brings it. They may also arise from unsatisfying work, that is, a job or career which calls for no skill, no personal involvement, no pride.",Eight of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,183,1041

From the image of work we move to its reward. Like the Nine the Seven shows the pentacles as a living development from the persons labour. Meaningful work gives more than material benefit; the person too grows. The Seven shows that moment of being able to look back with satisfaction on something accomplished. The something may be as broad as a career or as simple as an immediate project. The card implies that whatever has been built up (including relationships between people) has reached a point where it can grow by itself, and the person can step back from it without it collapsing.","### Reversed

For many people, meaningful work is simply not available. In general, the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or commitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well.",Seven of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,107,611
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_six_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## Six OF PENTACLES
The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself.
On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change.
Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfortable; or a political situation where people recognize they are oppressed, but do not wish to endanger what little security they have.
The card bears a (distorted) relationship to all those Major cards (the Hierophant, the Lovers, the Devil, and others) in which some force holds together or reconciles the opposites of life. Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going.
So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings.
As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited gifts from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent charity and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate *giving people what they are able to receive*.
I have emphasized these words because they imply something beyond their literal meaning. Most people will unconsciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order *consciously* to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person. As a more objective source of information, the Tarot can help us understand our own or someone elses needs. Because of these meanings, the Six of Pentacles relates to the Nine in the context of that card as an emblem of certitude.
The idea of giving what people are able to receive carries a religious meaning as well. Mystics and esotericists often say that the truth hidden within a specific religion may run almost opposite to what that religion appears to say on the surface. For instance, while doctrine may teach us to control our desires through pious thoughts, the occultist may attempt to bring forth and work with her or his most hidden urges. This split exists because most people are not only incapable of but even unwilling to deal with religious/psychological teachings in their undisguised form. Even many who try may find the truth impossible to assimilate. Consider Rabbi Ben Abuysh, who lost his faith when he thought he saw two Gods.
Idries Shah tells the fable of two men who come upon a tribe which harbours a great fear of water-melons, believing them to be demons. The first traveller tries to tell them the truth and is stoned as a heretic. The second accepts their orthodoxy, gains their confidence, and slowly works to educate them. Like this tale, the Six of Pentacles indicates the manner in which religion, and also esoteric teachings, give what we are capable of receiving. Waite, in describing this card, says a person in the guise of a merchant-not a merchant, but a person in the guise of one. And Nietzsche, in *Thus Spake Zarathustra*, has a hermit tell Zarathustra, If you want to go to them, give no more than an alm, and let them beg for that. Give more and no one will listen.
Yet who is this person in his merchant guise? Is he simply a teacher, or a religious or psychological doctrine? The scales suggest something more-Justice, which stands for truth, not just as correct information but as a living force holding together and balancing the universe. In the Ten of Pentacles we saw this force as the old man at the gate; here we see it as the merchant. *Life* gives us what we need, what we can use. Especially when we put ourselves in a position to receive.
People who work with meditation or the Tarot or similar disciplines (as well as people doing artistic work) often notice a curious phenomenon. Life appears to conspire to give them what they need to help them on their way. Not a great burst, but just enough to give them a little push when they can most use it. Here is an example. At the time when I was working with these meanings for the Six of Pentacles I did a Tarot reading for myself in which the Six came up crossing the Knight of Cups. I took this to mean that by keeping a meditative frame of mind I would receive benefit. Now, this occurred some months after my mothers death, and while visiting my father I found and began to wear a mezuzah (a kind of Jewish amulet) of my mothers. The mezuzah was inscribed with the name Shaddai. I recognized this word as a name of God, but did not know what it meant. Two or three days after the reading I went with my father to a synagogue for the Saturday prayers (something I would not have done on my own). On the way in I saw the name Shaddai on some jewellery on display, and mentioned my curiosity about its meaning.
When I looked at the Bible reading for that day I discovered a note explaining the meaning of Shaddai. Translated as Almighty it comes from a Hebrew root meaning to overpower. But it relates also to an Arabic word meaning benevolence, giving of gifts. Not only did the book answer my immediate question, but it gave me a greater understanding of the Six of Pentacles. The merchant symbolizes the force of life, which not only gives us what we need and can receive, but can also overpower us (yet ordinarily does not if we do not wish it) with spiritual wonder. And I had gained these insights (which, because I experienced them, meant more to me than they would have as intellectual ideas) by literally putting myself in a position to receive, that is, by going with my father to the synagogue.
From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts.","### Reversed

The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Sometimes this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity.

Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrupted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started.

Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives.",Six of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,1376,7870
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_five_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## Five OF PENTACLES
The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.
The Fives illustrate conflict and loss of some kind; in terms of Pentacles this means first of all material troubles, such as poverty or illness. Sometimes it implies a longstanding hardship. Observe that the people, though bent and crippled, are surviving. This card may indicate love, especially that of two people holding together in a bad situation. It may turn out that hardship has become one of the major factors keeping them together, so that relief from their material troubles may strain their unity - or they may think this will happen and therefore fear change.
Notice that they are passing a church. Now, as a place of sanctuary, the church represents rest and relief from the storm. The people, however, do not see it. Human beings can get used to anything, and when they do they will often not see opportunities for change; they will even resist an end to their problems. If we compare these people with the kneeling beggars of Six we see that Five represents pride and independence, sometimes to a foolish degree when help is genuinely offered.
As we examine the card more closely we can discover alternative, even opposed, meanings. The card shows no door to the church. As with many real churches today, which lock their doors like businesses at 5 pm, this church has perhaps shut the people out. The sanctuary has failed. We see first of all a comment on modern religion, which many feel has failed in the task of giving comfort and healing to peoples troubled souls. On a simpler level, in many countries the churches have grown rich at the peoples expense. Again, compare the Five with the Six. The merchant there may symbolize the modern secular church, giving what material assistance it can (or will), while the peoples spiritual needs go unattended.
We can call the previous paragraph the sociological interpretation of the doorless church. If we shift the emphasis to the people we can see a psychological view. Sometimes we may find ourselves in a situation where outside forces - social institutions, family, friends, etc. - cannot help us and we must struggle against the problems on our own.
We can extend this idea of a magic or occult interpretation. In Part One of this book I discussed how the magician, by setting out on a course of personal development, pits him or herself against the established Church, which traditionally acts as an intermediary between human beings and God. The choice may bring practical as well as political consequences. If the magician encounters dangerous psychic forces, then traditional religion cannot (let alone will not) help him or her overcome them. Compare the Five of Pentacles with the Hierophant, number 5 in the Major Arcana. There two supplicants submit to a doctrine that guides them in all situations. Here the people have rejected such doctrines, or have simply found them irrelevant.","### Reversed

Waite gives the meaning ‘chaos, disorder, ruin, confusion’. This suggests that the situation right side up has collapsed. The people are no longer surviving. While the immediate situation may seem much worse it can sometimes lead to improvement. When people accustom themselves to suffering, a collapse may release them. Whether they now can build something more positive depends partly on themselves and partly on the influence and opportunities around them.",Five of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,539,3174
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_four_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## FOUR OF PENTACLES
We see first of all the image of a miser, and by extension, dependence on material comforts and security for the stability symbolized by the number Four. As if in response to the troubles shown on the previous card the man has given himself a protective layer against any economic (or other) problems that might arise in the future. However, while the Five showed two people, here we see one person, excluding others through his need for personal security.
As magic signs the pentacles symbolize basic emotional/psychic energy. The man here uses his pentacles to close himself off from the outside world. He has covered his most vital points: the crown of the head (literally a crown here), the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet. People working with chakra meditation will recognize the first two as vital point connection to Spirit, and to other people. Covering the feet symbolizes blocking ourselves off from the world around us. The man cannot, however, seal his back. We always remain vulnerable to life, no matter how self-centred we try to make ourselves.
In certain situations, the Four, usually viewed as 'problem' card, becomes very appropriate. When life has broken down into chaos, then the Four indicates creating a structure, either through material things, or by turning emotional and mental energy inwards. The card remains an image of selfishness but sometimes selfishness may be precisely what is needed. People who meditate through their auras will usually, at the end of each meditation, follow a ritual of 'sealing' the aura at the chakra points. This practice prevents both a leaking of their own energy and a flooding of the self by outside influences.
Finally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles symbolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics.","### REVERSED

Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom—if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves—but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure.

We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.
To the right stand a monk and an architect holding the plans of the church. Together the three figures signify that the best work combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development.
Part of this cards meaning lies in the fact that such symbolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits.","### REVERSED

Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate.",Three of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,231,1342

Like the Two of Swords, the Two of Pentacles strikes a precarious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time-similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.
Like so many Pentacles, the card implies a hidden magic in its ordinary pleasures. The juggler holds his magic emblem within a loop or ribbon shaped like an infinity sign, the same sign which appears above the head of the Magician, and the woman in Strength. Some people believe that spiritual development occurs only in serious moments. Pleasure and amusement can also teach us a great deal, as long as we pay attention.","### REVERSED

Here the game becomes forced: Waite says 'simulated enjoyment'. Faced either with some problem we do not wish to face, or else with social pressure not to make a fuss, we may pretend to ourselves as well as to others, to take everything lightly. The juggling act is likely to fail.",Two of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,152,847
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_10_ace_of_pentacles,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_10,"## ACE OF PENTACLES
The gift of the Earth: nature, wealth, security, a joyful life. On this Ace alone we see no Yods falling from heaven. The Earth, in its completeness and solid reality, bears its own magic.
We have seen with the other cards (primarily the Ten) how the magic will often remain hidden from us simply because we see its products as so ordinary. Here the hand gives its gifts in a garden, a place sheltered from the wilderness seen beyond it. Civilization, when it works well, gives us this basic protection. Through the work of civilization humanity shapes the raw material of nature into a safe and comfortable environment.
Spiritual work leads us to recognize the magic in normal things, in both nature and civilization, and then to go beyond them to the greater knowledge symbolized by the mountains. The exit from the garden forms an arch very similar to the wreath of victory surrounding the World Dancer. As the Minor Arcana comes to an end the Ace of Pentacles shows us once more how, when we are ready, the Gate always opens to the truth.","### Reversed

Because material gifts exist in a way that the gifts of the other Aces do not, they are more open to abuse. The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people — selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort.

Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can symbolize a refusal to grow up — specifically, to become independent of our parents.

At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom.

# PART THREE: READINGS

# Introduction

The use of Tarot cards for doing readings—'divination', to give the practice its proper name—has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, 'serious' study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot.

Many people today still believe the Romany (the 'Gypsies') invented Tarot, despite clear evidence to the contrary. The connection between the two remains so strong that many women wishing to read professionally will dress in bright scarves and flouncing skirts and gold earrings (balloon pants and brocaded vests and one earring for men) and take names like 'Madam Sosostris' in order to satisfy the public.

The long association of Tarot reading with cheap theatricals probably explains, at least in part, the contempt or lack of interest many Tarot students have shown towards divination. Seeing the Tarot as both a diagram and a tool of conscious evolution, occultists and esotericists will automatically dismiss the use of the cards to usher in 'tall dark strangers' or mysterious inheritances. And yet, by seeing only the abuse and not the deeper possibilities in readings, these occultists have themselves limited the Tarot's true value.

Here is Arthur Edward Waite commenting on divination in his book *The Pictorial Key to the Tarot*: 'The allocation of a fortune-telling aspect to these cards is the story of a prolonged impertinence.' This brings us to an interesting paradox. Because they !looked down on fortune-telling, Waite and others have extended the misuse of readings. The derogatory way in which they wrote about it has fixed in many people's minds the image of trivial attempts to predict the future. As to why they wrote of it at all, we can only guess that they or their publishers assumed the public demanded such an approach. After all, even today most people who pick up a book on Tarot care more about mysterious messages than they do about achieving psychic transformation. Certainly the best-selling Tarot books give the simplest formulas for the cards' meanings—and at the same time promise all knowledge.

More important than why they bothered to write about it is the simple fact that few esotericists have done much to dispel the image of divination as trivial. This disregard has even extended to the entire Minor Arcana. Because the Minor cards are associated with readings many serious books on Tarot treat them very lightly, if at all (Waite's remark applied only to the Major cards). Paul Foster Case's book *The Tarot*, gives only the barest formulas in a kind of appendix at the back. Many others treat only the Major cards. Almost alone of modern esoteric studies Crowley's *The Book Of Thoth* goes deeply into the Minor cards, linking them to a complex astrological system.

As for methods of doing readings, the most important esoteric studies have given only the barest information, a few 'spreads' or designs for laying out the cards, with formula explanations for the different positions. Again, Crowley is the exception, presenting a characteristically complicated system of readings via an astrological 'clock'.

The impact of depth psychology and humanistic astrology has led many contemporary writers to seek a more serious use of divination. Unfortunately, by treating readings in such an offhand manner, the earlier writers have created a tradition of formulas which modern writers have found hard to shake off. Thus we still find the same sorts of explanations for the Minor cards, such as 'All is not yet lost; good fortune is still possible' (Douglas); and the same brief descriptions of spreads, with explanations such as 'best possible outcome' for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Kabbalah but to the I Ching, Jungian philosophy, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psychology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be.",Ace of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,189,1062
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_3_the_fool,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_3,"## THE FOOL
We have already looked at the Fool in one aspect, the image of a spirit totally free. But we can look at the Fool from another side - the leap into the archetypal world of trumps.
Imagine yourself entertaining a strange landscape. A world of magicians, of people hanging upside down, and of dancers in the bright air. You can enter through a leap from a height, through a dark cave, a labyrinth, or even by climbing down a rabbit hole chasing a Victorian rabbit with a pocket watch. Whichever way you choose, you are a fool to do it. Why look into the deep world of the mind when you can stay safely in the ordinary landscape of job, home and family? Herman Melville, in *Moby Dick*, warned his readers not to take even a step outside the ordinary path laid out for you by society. You might not get back again.
And yet, for those willing to take the chance, the leap can bring joy, adventure, and finally, for those with the courage to keep going when the wonderland becomes more fearsome than joyous, the leap can bring knowledge, peace, and liberation. Interestingly, the Fool archetype appears more in mythology than in structured religion. An institutionalized Church can hardly urge people beyond the limits of its institutions. Instead, the churches offer us a safe haven from the fears of life. Mythology leads directly into the heart of those fears, and in every culture the mythological landscape contains the image of the Trickster - pushing, goading, jabbing the kings and heroes whenever they turn away from the inner world of truth.
In the King Arthur legends Merlin appears not only as a sorcerer and wise man but as a trickster. Constantly he appears before Arthur in disguise, as a child, a beggar, an old peasant. The young king, already seduced into pompousness by his high social position, never recognizes Merlin until his companions point out that he has been tricked again. More important than laws or military strategy is the ability to see through illusions. The Taoist masters were famous for playing tricks on their disciples.
The Fool archetype has even found social expression, as the real court jester. We all know the image from *King Lear* of the fool, permitted to tell the king truths no one else would dare to express. Today, our comedians and satirists enjoy something of the same privilege.
In many countries a yearly carnival releases all the wildness repressed through the rest of the year. Sex is freer, various laws are suspended, people go in disguises and the King of Fools is chosen to preside over the festival. Today, in Europe and North America, April the first remains April Fools Day, a time for tricks and practical jokes.
The picture beside that of the Rider pack shows the Fool as conceived by Oswald Wirth. An older tradition than that of Waite, it pictures the archetype as a grotesque wanderer. This image has been interpreted variously as the soul before enlightenment, a newborn child entering the world of experience and the principle of anarchy. Elizabeth Haich has provided an interesting interpretation of Wirths grotesque image of the Fool. Placing him between Judgement and the World, she describes the Fool as what the outside world sees when it looks upon someone who is truly enlightened. Because the Fool does not follow their rules or share their weaknesses, he appears to them in this ugly distorted way. Haich describes the Fools face as a mask, put there not by himself but by the outside world. The last card, the World, presents the same enlightened person, but viewed from inside, that is, by himself.
In some early Tarot decks the Fool appeared as a giant court jester, towering over the people around him. His title was the Fool of God. The term has also been used for idiots, harmless madmen, and severe epileptics, all of whom were thought to be in touch with a greater wisdom precisely because they were out of touch with the rest of us.
The archetype persists in modern popular mythology as well. By their fantastic primitive nature comic books often reflect mythological themes better than novels. In *Batman* the heros strongest enemy is called the Joker, a figure who has no past and is never seen without the wild make-up of a joker in a deck of cards. The joker is not descended from the Fool as I, and other Tarotists, have assumed. It was invented by a New York poker club as a wild card to make the game more interesting. It does, however, call forth the same archetype as the Fool, being based on the court jester. The rivalry of Batman and the Joker sends a clear message to their readers: do not rebel against social values. Support law and order. In recent years the magazine has described the Joker as insane rather than criminal. To society the way of the Fool, instinct rather than rules, is a dangerous insanity.
So far we have looked at the Fool as the other, prodding us from complacency with his jokes and disguises. As the self he represents that long tradition of the foolish brother or sister, despised by the older brothers and sisters, yet finally able to win the princess or the prince through instinctive wit and kindness.
Curiously the image of the Fool as self occurs more in fairy tales than myths. We look at myths as representing forces larger than ourselves; the simpler fairy tale allows us to express our own foolishness.
Like 'Boots' or 'Gluck' in the fairy tale, always accompanied by various animal helpers, the Fool in almost every deck walks with a companion. In Waite the figure is a leaping dog, in others a cat or even a crocodile. The animal symbolizes the forces of nature and the animal self of man, all in harmony with the spirit who acts from instinct. Mythological dogs are often terrifying, for example, the Hound of Hell chasing lost souls. But it is really the same beast; only our attitude changes. Deny your inner self and it becomes ferocious. Obey it and it becomes benign.
Waites Fool holds a white rose. Roses symbolize passion, while white, the traditional colour of purity, together with the delicate way the flower is held, indicate the passions raised to a higher level. The Greeks saw Eros, the god of love, as a trickster, making the most proper people act ridiculous. But those who already express their folly will not be thrown by love. The Greeks also spoke of Eros, in other forms, as the animating force of the universe.
The bag behind him carries his experiences. He does not abandon them, he is not mindless, they simply do not control him in the way that our memories and traumas so often control our lives. The bag bears the head of an eagle, symbol of the soaring spirit. His high instinct fills and transforms all experience. The eagle is also the symbol of Scorpio raised to a higher level, that is, sexuality raised to spirit. This idea of the connection between sex and spirit will come up again with the card of the Devil.
Over his shoulder the Fool carries a stick, like a tramp. But this stick is actually a wand, symbol of power. The Magician and the Chariot driver also carry wands, but self-consciously, with a powerful grip. The Fool and the World Dancer hold their wands so casually we hardly notice them. What could be more foolish than to take a magic wand and use it to carry your bags? We can imagine a fairy tale in which the foolish younger brother finds a stick by the side of the road and carries it, not recognizing it as the lost wand of a wizard, and therefore not being destroyed like his two older brothers who tried to wield it for their own profit.
The Fools wand is black; the others are white. For the unconscious Fool the spirit force remains always in potential, always ready, because he is not consciously directing it. We tend to misunderstand the colour black, seeing it as evil, or negation of life. Rather, black means all things being possible, infinite energy of life before consciousness has constructed any boundaries. When we fear blackness or darkness we fear the deep unconscious source of life itself.
Like the joker, the Fool really belongs anywhere in the deck, in combination with and between any of the other cards. He is the animating force giving life to the static images. In the Major Arcana he belongs wherever there is a difficult transition. Hence his position at the beginning, where there is the transition from the everyday world of the Minor Arcana to the world of archetypes. The Fool also helps us jump the gap from one line to the next, that is, from the Chariot to Strength, from Temperance to the Devil. To reach the Chariot or Temperance requires great effort and courage, and without the Fools readiness to leap into new territory we would likely stop with what we have already achieved.
The Fool belongs as well with those cards of difficult passage, such as the Moon and Death (observe the winding road on each of these two), where he urges us on despite our fears.
In the Minor Arcana the Fool relates first of all to Wands-action, eagerness, movement without thought. But it connects as well to Cups, with their emphasis on imagination and instinct. The Fool, in fact, combines these two suits. Later we will see that this combination, fire and water, represents the way of transformation.
Finally the question arises of the Fools place in divinatory readings. I have already mentioned the importance of readings for a fuller understanding of the cards. Even more, they help us apply the wisdom of the cards to our daily lives. In readings the Fool speaks to us of courage and optimism, urging faith in ourselves and in life. At difficult times, when we come under pressure from people around us to be practical, the Fool reminds us that our own inner selves can best tell us what to do.
The Fool can often symbolize beginnings, courageously leaping off into some new phase of life, particularly when that leap is taken from some deep feeling rather than careful planning.
These belong to the Fool in its normal position. We must also consider the 'reversed' meanings, that is, when the way we have mixed the cards makes the Fool come out with the feet on the top. Reversed meanings are controversial among Tarot commentators. Those who give formulas as meanings usually just turn the formula around, a simplistic method which has led several interpreters to abandon the whole idea of reversed meanings. But we can also look at reversals as deepening the meaning of the card as a whole. In general, a reversed card indicates that the qualities of that card have become blocked, distorted or channelled in another direction.","### Reversed
For the Fool a reversal means first of all a failure to follow your instincts. It can mean not taking a chance at some crucial time, because of fear or depending too much on plans and the practical advice of others.

Another reversed meaning of the Fool will appear at first to contradict the one just given. Recklessness, wildness, crazy schemes all seem the opposite of over-caution. And yet, they originate from the same weakness, a failure to act from inside. The reckless person superimposes a conscious or artificial foolishness on his life both because he does not trust the unconscious to act as a guide and because is also afraid of doing nothing.

This second reversed meaning suggests another dimension to the Fool — the awareness that great chances must be taken only at the proper time. There are, after all, many times when caution is needed, and times when it is better to do nothing at all. The basic thing any oracle teaches us is that no action or attitude is right or wrong, except in its proper context.

As we go further into the Tarot we will see that this concept of the proper time permeates the cards and is, in fact, the true key to their correct use. The card in the Rider pack that falls exactly in the middle of the three lines, that is, Justice, means a proper response.",The Fool,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1850,10558
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_3_the_magician,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_3,"## THE MAGICIAN
The Magician emerges very directly from the Fool in the image of the trickster-wizard. As mentioned above, Merlin fulfils both these roles (as well as that of teacher and wise man), and many other myths make the same connection. Earlier Tarot decks pictured trump number one as a conjurer rather than a magus, or even a juggler tossing coloured balls in the air. Charles Williams described him as a juggler tossing the stars and planets.
Most modern images of the trump follow Waites wizard, raising a magic wand to bring into reality the spirit force - the energy of life in its most creative form. He holds the wand carefully, aware of that psychic power the Fool carried so lightly on his shoulder. Thus, the Magician, as the beginning of the Major Arcana proper, represents consciousness, action and creation. He symbolizes the idea of manifestation, that is, making something real out of the possibilities in life. Therefore, we see the four emblems of the Minor Arcana - lying on a table in front of him. He not only uses the physical world for his magical operations (the four emblems are all objects used by wizards in their rituals), but he also creates the world, in the sense of giving life a meaning and direction.
The Magician stands surrounded by flowers to remind us that the emotional and creative power we feel in our lives needs to be grounded in physical reality for us to get any value from it. Unless we make something of our potentials they do not really exist.
'In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.' The Bible begins at the moment the spirit descends into physical reality. For us, in the physical world, we can talk of nothing before this moment. In the linking of the Tarot with the Hebrew alphabet the Fool often receives the first letter Aleph. (Aleph bears no sound; it is a silent carrier of vowels, and therefore symbolizes nothingness. It is the first letter of the Ten Commandments.) This would assign the second Hebrew letter, Beth, the first letter with an actual sound, to the Magician. Beth is the first letter of Genesis.
Look at Waites picture of the Magician. He is not casting spells, or conjuring up demons. He simply stands with one hand raised to heaven and the other pointed to the green earth. He is a lightning rod. By opening himself up to the spirit he draws it down into himself, and then that downward hand, like a lightning rod buried in the ground, runs the energy into the earth. Into reality.
We see many accounts of the 'descent of the spirit' in the Bible, in other religious texts and in contemporary religious experience. People 'speak in tongues' in Pentecostal churches, they scream and shout and roll on the floor at Gospel meetings. The priest giving communion sees himself as a 'vessel' or channel for the Holy Ghost. But we can see this experience in much simpler, non-religious, terms as well. People tremble with excitement at sporting events. 'Im so excited I could burst!' In a new love affair or at the start of a new career, we feel a power filling us. You can sometimes see people at the opening of some important phase of their lives, tapping their legs up and down, half bouncing in their seats, filled with some energy they cannot seem to discharge. And writers and artists, when their work is going well, will experience themselves as almost passive channels for a spirit-like force. The word 'inspiration' originally meant 'filled with a holy breath', and derives from the same root as 'spirit'.
Notice that of all these examples all but the priest and the artist are seized with a frenzy. The possessed church-goer and the teenager about to burst at a football game share the feeling that their bodies are overwhelmed by a power too great for it. Far from being gentle the surge of energy can be almost painful. The person in religious fervour shouts and leaps about in order to release an unbearable energy.
The life force that fills the universe is not gentle or benign. It must be discharged, grounded in something real, because our bodies, our selves, are not meant to contain it, but only pass it on. Thus, the artist does not join in the physical frenzy because she or he is discharging that power into the painting. Similarly the priest passes the power into the bread and wine.
We function best as a channel for energy. Unless we follow the path of the High Priestess in withdrawing from the world, we live our lives most fully when we create or are active. Create does not mean simply art, but any activity that produces something real and valuable outside of ourselves.
Many people experience feelings of being powerful so infrequently they try to hold on to them. By doing nothing they hope to preserve their magic moments. But we can really hold on to power in our lives only by constantly discharging it. By releasing creative power we open ourselves up to receive a further flow. However, by trying to hold on to it, we block the channels and the sense of power, which is really life itself, withers within us. The spectator at the football game, even the possessed church-goer, will find their excitement gone after the event that triggered it has ended. But the craftsman or scientist or teacher - or, for that matter, the Tarot reader - will find the power increase over the years the more they discharge it into physical reality.
When we look at the Magician those of us who feel a lack or a flatness in our lives will be drawn to the wand raised towards heaven. But the real magic rests in that finger pointing to the earth. That ability to create gives him his title. His image stems not only from the trickster-conjurer, but also from the archetypal hero. In our culture this would be Prometheus, who brought the heavenly fire down to weak and cold humanity.
In the West we tend to see wizards as manipulators. They learn secret techniques or make deals with Satan in order to gain personal power. This somewhat decadent image comes partly from the magicians themselves, since they make charms to find buried treasure, but also from the Church, which sees magicians, who deal directly with the spirit instead of going through the official priesthood, as competitors. The Tarot and all occult sciences are in a sense revolutionary, because they teach direct salvation, in this life, through your own efforts.
We can get a different concept of the Magician through the image of the shaman, or medicine man. Because no hierarchical Church has arisen to banish the shamans they have not become isolated from the community. They serve as healers, teachers, and directors of the soul after death. Like the wizards, the shamans study and learn complicated techniques. Their magical vocabulary is often much larger than the everyday vocabulary of the people around them. None of this training, however, is used to manipulate the spirit or for personal gain. Rather, the shaman only seeks to become a proper channel, both for himself so he will not be overwhelmed, and for the community so he can serve them better. He knows the great power that will enter him at moments of ecstasy and he wants to make sure it does not destroy him and make him of no use to the people around him.
Like the wizard the shaman has developed his will to the point where he can direct the fire that fills him. At the same time he remains open, allowing his ego to dissolve under the direct onslaught of the spirit. It says something about our culture that our wizards stand inside magic circles to make sure the demons cannot touch them.
We can apply the shaman attitude to our use of the whole Tarot deck. We study the cards, learn the symbolic language, even specific formulas, in order to give a direction to the feelings they arouse in us. But we must not forget that the true magic lies in the images themselves and not the explanations.
The divinatory meanings of the Magician derive from both hands, the one which receives the power and the one which directs. The card means first of all an awareness of power in your life, of spirit or simple excitement possessing you. It can also mean, depending on its position and your reaction to it, someone elses power affecting you. Like the Fool, the card refers to beginnings, but here the first actual steps. It can mean both the inspiration to begin some new project or phase of life, and the excitement that sustains you through the hard work to reach your goal. For many people the Magician can become a strong personal symbol for the creative force throughout their lives.
Secondly, the Magician means will-power; the will unified and directed towards goals. It means having great strength because all your energy is channelled in a specific direction. People who seem always to get what they want in life are often people who simply know what they want and can direct their energy. The Magician teaches us that both will-power and success derive from being conscious of the power available to everyone. Most people rarely act; instead they react, being knocked from one experience to the next. To act is to direct your strength, through the will, to the places where you want it to go.","### Reversed
The Magician reversed signifies that in some way the proper flow of energy has become disrupted or blocked. It can mean a weakness, a lack of will or a confusion of purpose that leads to doing nothing. The power is there, but we cannot touch it. The card reversed can mean the lethargic apathy that characterizes depression.

The reversed trump can also mean power abused, a person who uses his or her very strong character to exert a destructive influence on others. The most direct example of this would of course be the psychic aggression of 'black magic'.

Finally, the Magician reversed indicates mental disquiet, hallucinations, fear and particularly fear of madness. This problem arises when the energy or spirit fire enters a person who does not know how to direct it into an outer reality. If we do not ground the lightning it can become trapped in the body and force itself on our awareness as anxiety or hallucinations. Anyone who has ever gone through a moment of total panic will know that acute mental anxiety is a very physical experience, a feeling of the body running wild, like a fire out of control. The word 'panic' means 'possessed by the god Pan', himself a symbol of magical forces.

Think again of the lightning rod. It not only attracts the bolt but runs it into the dirt. Without that connection to the earth the lightning would burn down the house.

Several writers have commented on the relationship between shamanism and what the West calls 'schizophrenia'. Shamans are often not so much chosen as found. If, in our culture, a young person experiences visions, fearful hallucinations, we do not know what to do with such experiences other than to try and stop them, by drugs and self-control. But in other cultures, such people receive training. This is not to say that madness does not exist or is not recognized in archaic cultures. Rather, the training is meant to prevent madness by channelling the experiences into a productive direction.

The initiates learn, through study with an established shaman, and through physical techniques such as fasting, how to understand, structure and finally direct these visionary experiences towards the service of the community. The Magician reversed should not be banished or confined; instead, we must find the way to turn it right side up.",The Magician,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1607,9146
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_3_the_high_priestess,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_3,"## The High Priestess
Bill Butler, in *The Definitive Tarot* has commented on the historical-legendary sources for this female archetype. Throughout the Middle Ages the story persisted that a woman was once elected Pope. Disguised for years as a man, this supposed Pope Joan made her way through the Church hierarchy to the top position, only to die in childbirth during an Easter celebration.
Pope Joan was most likely a legend; the Visconti Papess was real. In the late thirteenth century, an Italian group called the Guglielmites believed that their founder, Guglielma of Bohemia, who died in 1281, would rise again in 1300 and begin a new age in which women would be popes. Jumping ahead, they elected a woman named Manfreda Visconti as the first papess. The Church graphically ended this heresy by burning Sister Manfreda in 1300, the year of the expected new age. Some one hundred and fifty years later, the same Visconti family commissioned the first set of Tarot cards as we know them. Among these unnumbered and unnamed trumps appeared a picture of a woman later decks titled 'The Papess'.
The name persisted until the eighteenth century when Court de Gebelin, believing the Tarot to originate in the Isis religion of ancient Egypt, changed the name to the High Priestess. Today both names exist (as well as 'Veiled Isis'), and the Waite image of the card derives directly from the Isis priestess's symbolic clothing, particularly the crown representing the three phases of the moon.
The Pope Joan legend and Manfreda Visconti are not simply historical curiosities. They illustrate a major social development in the Middle Ages, the reintroduction of the female and feminine principles into religion and cosmology. The images and the concepts associated with the masculine role had dominated both the Church and Jewish religion for centuries. As a result, ordinary people experienced the religions of the priests and rabbis as remote, harsh, and unapproachable, with their emphasis on sin, judgement, and punishment. They wanted qualities of mercy and love. And they identified these with women. Like a mother shelters her child from the somewhat distant strictness of the father, a female deity supposedly would intrude for the pathetic sinners against the unremitting judgement of the Father.
It is interesting to realize that in many ways the Church saw Christ, as the Son, in exactly that role of introducing love and compassion. Yet, the people demanded a female. Even the idea of the Church as 'Mother Church' did not go far enough. Finally, the Church capitulated by raising the Virgin Mary almost to the level of Christ himself.
Many writers and scholars believe that the elevation of Mary - as well as the priests' costume of long skirts - originated in the Churchs desire to assimilate a persistent goddess religion from the days before Christianity. If this is true it would indicate not so much a cultural conservatism as the power of the female archetype to maintain a hold and partially triumph against suppression.
In Judaism the official religion of the rabbis managed to resist any insurgent feminism. The peoples need, however, took hold in another area: the long tradition of the Kabbalah. The Kabbalists took a term from the Talmud, Shekinah, which meant Gods glory manifest in the physical world, and revised it to make it Gods anima, or female side. The Kabbalists also revised the idea of Adam, making him originally hermaphroditic. The separation of Eve from Adam, even the separation of the Shekinah from God, became images of isolation and exile, sometimes connected to Adam and the sin of disobedience.
So far we have looked at the benign motherly qualities of female mythological figures. Historically, however, female deities have always shown a dark, hidden side as well. To introduce the female at all is to introduce the whole archetype. The Tarot splits up the feminine archetype into two trumps and actually assigns the benign qualities to the second one (trump 3), the Empress. The High Priestess herself represents a deeper, more subtle aspect of the female; that of the dark, the mysterious and the hidden. As such, she connects to the virgin side of the Virgin Mary, the pure daughter side of the Shekinah (who was pictured simultaneously as mother, wife, and daughter).
We should realize that this assigning of qualities to women comes mostly from men and male ideas. The Kabbalists, the occultists, and the Tarot designers, all deplored the separation of men and women into categories and taught unification as a final goal. This is shown by the World dancer of the Tarot. They were ahead of the established religion which even debated whether women had souls at all. Nevertheless, men still made the categories. To men, women have always appeared mysterious, strange, and, when safely in their mother role, loving and merciful. Women seem alien to men, more subtle in their thinking and non-rational. In our time, constant novels and films have pictured simple men manipulated by cunning women.
The fact that the menstrual cycle lasts about as long as the lunar cycle links women to that remote silvery body. Menstruation itself, a copious bleeding from the genitals, with no loss of life, has simply terrified men through the centuries. Even today superstitious Jews believe that one drop of menstrual blood will kill a plant. The fearful mystery of birth further connected women to the idea of darkness. The foetus grows and the soul enters it in the warm moist darkness of the womb. Motherhood linked women to the earth, and there too darkness dominates. Seeds lie in the ground through the dark dead winter, to emerge as food under the warm reassuring rays of the sun which, in many cultures, is considered as male.
Just as the suns rays penetrate the earth so the male organ penetrates the female to leave a seed in her mysterious womb. We can easily see how men came to view themselves as active and women as both passive and mysterious. People often link passive with negative or that is, inferior and weak. But passivity contains its own power. It gives the mind a chance to work. People who only know action never get a chance to reflect on what that action has taught them. In a deeper sense, passivity allows the unconscious to emerge. Only through withdrawal from outer involvement can we allow the inner voice of vision and psychic forces to speak to us. It is precisely to avoid this inner voice that many people never rest from action and movement. Our society, based completely on outer achievement, fosters a terror of the unconscious, yet without its wisdom we can never fully know ourselves or the world.
The High Priestess represents all these qualities: darkness, mystery, psychic forces, the power of the moon to stir the unconscious, passivity, and the wisdom gained from it. This wisdom cannot be expressed in rational terms; to try to do so would be to immediately limit, narrow, and falsify it. Most people at some time have felt they understood something in such a deep way that they could never manage to explain it. Myths serve as metaphors for deep psychic feelings; yet the myths themselves, like the explanations given by theologians and anthropologists, are only symbols. The High Priestess signifies inner wisdom at its deepest level.
She sits before two pillars, representing both the temple of Isis and the ancient Hebrew temple in Jerusalem, the dwelling place of God on earth, in other words, the home of the Shekinah. A veil hangs between the two pillars, indicating that we are barred from entering the place of wisdom. The image of the veiled temple or sanctuary appears in many religions. The Shekinah was indeed said to dwell within the veiled ark of the temple.
Now, most people assume we are somehow forbidden to pass the pillars of the High Priestess. In reality, we simply do not know how to. To enter behind the veil would be to know consciously the irrational wisdom of the unconscious. That is the goal of the entire Major Arcana. Look carefully at Smiths picture. You can see what lies behind the veil by looking between the veil and the pillars. And what lies behind is water. No great temple or complex symbols, simply a pool of water, a line of hills, and the sky. The pool signifies the unconscious and the truth hidden there. The water is motionless, the secrets in its darkest depths, hidden under a smooth surface. For most of us, at most times, the turbulent unconscious remains hidden under a placid layer of consciousness. We cannot enter the temple because we do not know how to go into ourselves; therefore we must travel through the trumps until we reach the Star and the Moon, where we can finally stir up the waters and return with the wisdom to the conscious light of the Sun.
The temple introduces the image of the two pillars, and the theme of duality and opposites. The image occurs again and again through the trumps, in such obvious places as the Hierophants church pillars or the two towers of the Moon (the pillars of the High Priestess seen from the other side), but also in more subtle ways, such as the two sphinxes of the Chariot, or the man and woman of the Lovers. Finally, Judgement, with the child rising between a man and a woman, and the World, holding two wands, resolves the duality by uniting the inner mysteries with the outer awareness.
The letters B and J stand for Boaz and Jakin, the names given to the two main pillars of the temple in Jerusalem. Obviously, the dark Boaz stands for passivity and mystery while Jakin symbolizes action and consciousness. Notice, though, that the letters carry the reverse indications, a white B and a black J. Like the dots in the Tao symbol the letters signify that duality is an illusion, and each extreme carries the other imbedded inside it.
In her lap she holds a scroll marked Tora. This name refers to the Jewish law, the Five Books of Moses which is usually spelled Torah in English. This particular spelling allows the word to serve as an anagram for Taro. As the ultimate subject of all Kabbalistic meditations (like Christs crucifixion for Christian mystics) the Torah carries a great deal of esoteric significance. The Kabbalists believed that the Torah read on Saturday mornings in the synagogues was only a representation, a kind of shadow of the true Torah, the living word of God that existed before the universe and contains within it all true existence. The Tora held by the High Priestess, rolled up and partly concealed in her cloak, therefore signifies a higher knowledge closed to us with our lower understanding. We can describe it also as the psychic truths available to us only in the distorted form of myths and dreams.
Earlier we spoke of the Fool coming in at crucial moments of change to push us along. The gap between the High Priestess and the Empress is one such moment. We can too easily be seduced by the dark coolness of the second trump, even if we never really penetrate its secrets. The person beginning in spiritual discipline often prefers to stay at the visionary level rather than go through the slow hard work needed to advance. Many people in more ordinary situations will find life too overwhelming, too vast and demanding, for them to take part. We can best use the High Priestesss passivity as a balance to the outward-looking attitude of the Magician, but many people find the passive side extremely attractive. It represents an answer to struggle, a quiet retreat instead of the harsh glare of self-exposure when we involve ourselves openly with other people.
But the human mind does not work like that. It requires passion and it needs to connect itself to the world. If we cannot penetrate the veil the temple remains for us an empty place, devoid of meaning. The person who tries to live a completely passive life becomes depressed, more and more trapped in a cycle of apathy and fear.
Virtually all moon goddess religions feature myths of the goddesss ferocious side. Ovid tells the story of Actaeon, a hunter, and therefore a figure who properly belonged to the world of action. He happened one day to see a stream and decided to follow it to its source (again, water as a symbol of the unconscious). Thus he became separated from his dogs and the other hunters, and when he had reached the source, away from the active world, he saw a group of maidens. Among them, naked, stood the virgin goddess, Diana. Now, if Actaeon had returned immediately to the outer world he would have found his life enriched. Instead, he allowed Dianas beauty to fascinate him; he stayed too long, and the goddess, discovering that a man had seen her nakedness (compare the High Priestesss layers of clothing with the Star maidens nudity) turned Actaeon into a stag. When he ran away, terrified, his own dogs tore him to pieces.
Here the Fool comes in (and remember the Fools dog, leaping at his side), reminding us to dance lightly away from both these visions, the Magician as well as the High Priestess, until we are truly ready to assimilate them.
The divinatory meanings of the High Priestess deal first with a sense of mystery in life, both things we do not know, and things we cannot know. It indicates a sense of darkness, sometimes as an area of fear in our lives, but also one of beauty. A period of passive withdrawal can enrich our lives by allowing things inside to awaken.
As an emblem of secret knowledge the trump indicates that feeling of intuitively understanding the answer to some great problem, if only we could express that answer consciously. More specifically, the card can refer to visions and to occult and psychic powers, such as clairvoyance.
In its most positive aspect the High Priestess signifies the potential in our lives - very strong possibilities we have not realized, though we can sense them as possible. Action must follow or the potential will never be realized.
Despite its deep wisdom the card can sometimes carry a negative meaning. Like most of the trumps, the High Priestesss value depends on the context of the other cards. Negatively the trump indicates passiveness at the wrong time or for too long, leading to weakness, fear of life and other people. It shows a person with strong intuition who cannot translate feelings into action, or a person afraid to open up to other people. Whether the good or bad aspect of the card comes up in a particular reading depends on the surrounding cards and of course the readers intuition (we partake of the High Priestess every time we read the cards). Very often both meanings will apply. Human beings have more than one side.
The High Priestess is an archetype, a single-minded picture of one aspect of existence. When we reverse it we bring in the missing qualities.","### Reversed
The card reversed signifies a turn towards passion, towards a deep involvement with life and other people, in all ways, emotionally, sexually and competitively. However, the pendulum can swing too far, and then the card reversed can symbolize a loss of that most precious knowledge: the sense of our inner selves.",The High Priestess,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,2529,14765
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_4_the_empress,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_4,"## THE EMPRESS
As stated in the previous chapter the Empress represents the more accessible, more benign aspects of the female archetype. She is motherhood, love, gentleness. At the same time she signifies sexuality, emotion and the female as mistress. Both motherhood and sex derive from feelings that are non-intellectual and basic to life. Passions rather than ideas. The High Priestess represented the mental side of the female archetype; her deep intuitive understanding. The Empress is pure emotion.
Like the Cunning Woman, we see her reflected in our movies and novels as the exasperating female, who both frustrates and delights, because her thought processes follow no rational development. Many women find this image insulting, partly because it represents values and approaches judged as negative by our patriarchal society, and partly because people make the error of assuming that women and men should personally express these archetypal ideas. But the social images are crippling in another way as well. They are trivial. The Empress, along with such mythological counterparts as Aphrodite or Ishtar or Erzulie, represent something very grand. They signify the passionate approach to life. They give and take experience with uncontrolled feeling.
Until we learn to experience the outer world completely we cannot hope to transcend it. Therefore the first step to enlightenment is sensuality. Only through passion, can we sense, from deep inside rather than through intellectual argument, the spirit that fills all existence.
Many people see religion as an alternative to the natural world, which they view as somehow impure or dirty. Though our cultural tradition fosters this duality it is really an illusion, and the person who approaches spirituality with this motivation to escape will likely never achieve a very developed understanding. The body, and the natural world, are realities that must be integrated rather than denied.
In the mythology of Buddhism we find that the gods manipulated Prince Siddharthas father into providing his son, Gautama, with every sensual satisfaction. The father believed that pleasure would prevent his son from renouncing the world and becoming a Buddha. The scheme backfired, because only after he had completely experienced sensuality could the prince leave it behind. After renouncing the world Gautama joined the ascetics, the other pole. But he reached enlightenment only when he had rejected both extremes for the Middle Way. Thus, we can see the Buddha in the World dancer who holds both the Magician and the High Priestess lightly in her hands.
As a combination of 1 and 2 the number 3 signifies synthesis and harmony. The natural world combines the Magician and the High Priestess in an indivisible unity of life and death, darkness and light. The idea of emotion also brings together the Magician archetype of activeness with the High Priestess archetype of instinct.
Consider as well the process of creation. The Magician symbolizes the energy of life, the High Priestess the possibilities of future development. The reality of the Empress results from their combination. Recently Carl Sagan demonstrated that life on earth might have begun when a lightning bolt struck the primordial sea. Thus again, from the lightning of the Magician striking the waters of the High Priestess, comes the natural world.
The symbolism of the Waite-Smith Empress reflects the idea of nature, with all its force and glory. The Empress herself, voluptuous and sensual, suggests passion. Her shield is a heart with the sign of Venus, the Roman version of the Great Goddess. Throughout the ancient world the goddess ruled, as Demeter, Astarte, Nut, until the patriarchal invaders demoted her to wife (and finally banished her altogether with an all-male godhead). At the Empresss feet grows a field of grain; the goddess ruled agriculture, and in North-Western Europe was called the Corn Goddess. She wears a necklace of nine pearls, for the nine planets, while her crown contains twelve stars for the signs of the zodiac. In short, she wears the universe as her jewellery. The Great Mother is not the forms of nature, but the underlying principle of life. The stars are six-pointed, a symbol much older than its current use as a social emblem for Judaism. The six-pointed star combines two triangles; the upwards one symbolizes fire, the downwards one water. Again, the Empress combines trumps 1 and 2 in a new reality.
A river flows from the trees behind her to disappear beneath her seat. This river is the force of life, running like a great current beneath all the separate forms of reality, and experienced most fully when we give ourselves to unrestrained passion. Deep in our selves we can sense the rhythm of a river, carrying us forward through experience until, with death, our individual lives return to the sea of existence.
The river symbolizes also the unity of change and stability. The water in it is never the same, yet it always remains a particular river, with its own special qualities. Human beings change from day to day, the cells of our bodies die and new ones take their place, yet we always remain ourselves.
The number 3 produced by the combination of 1 and 2 brings out yet another idea. Just as the numbers 1 and 2 stood specifically for male and female, so the number 3 signifies the child produced by their joining together. The child is born as a creature of nature, unburdened with ego and personality, experiencing the universe directly, without controls or labels. It is only as we grow older that we learn to put barriers between ourselves and life. It is one of the goals of the Tarot to return us to that natural state of directly experiencing the world around us.
But if the Empress signifies the child she also stands for the mother. Motherhood is the basic means by which life continues throughout nature. And because the physical bond of the mother and child is so direct, mother love, in its strongest form, is pure feeling, given without intellectual or moral considerations. (This is, of course, an ideal, and in reality such love may come more from the male parent than the female, or sadly, not at all.) Throughout history people have identified motherhood with nature, so that the term Great Mother for the earth itself appears all over the world, and even today we speak vaguely of Mother Nature.
In readings the Empress represents a time of passion, a period when we approach life through feelings and pleasure rather than thought. The passion is sexual or motherly; either way it is deeply experienced, and in the right context can give great satisfaction. In the wrong context, when analysis is needed, the Empress can mean a stubborn emotional approach, a refusal to consider the facts. She can indicate another problem as well: self-indulgent pleasure when restraint is needed. Usually, however, she indicates satisfaction and even understanding gained through the emotions.","### Reversed
The reversed meanings of the cards also have their positive and negative contexts. On the one hand it can signify a retreat from feeling, either rejecting your emotions or attempting to suppress your desires, particularly sexual. However, just as the High Priestess, upside down, added the missing element of involvement, so the Empress reversed can mean a new intellectual awareness, especially the solving of some complicated emotional problem by calmly thinking it through.

In their right side up and reversed meanings trumps 2 and 3 are mirrors of each other. It sometimes happens that in a reading both will appear, upside down. This means that the person expresses both emotional and intuitive mental aspects, but in a negative way. Rationality comes as a reaction to excessive emotional involvement, while a feeling of isolation or coldness leads to passion. If the two aspects of the goddess can be experienced right side up the person will achieve a more stable and rewarding balance.",The Empress,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1143,6972
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_4_the_emperor,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_4,"## THE EMPEROR
For each child its parents are archetypes. Not just mother and father, but Mother and Father. Because our mothers give us life and feed us and shelter us we tend to see them as figures of love and mercy (and get very upset when they act harshly or coldly). But the Father, especially in traditional times when the sex roles were stricter, remained more remote, and therefore a figure of severity. It was the father who bore the authority and thus became the judge, the father who punished (and the mother who intervened) and the father who taught us the rules of society and then demanded obedience. To the child the father is in many ways indistinguishable from society as a whole, just as the mother is nature itself. One of the painful moments of maturity for many people comes when they discover the limited humanity of their parents.
In Freuds scheme of mental development the father and the rules of society become directly linked. The infant psyche demands constant satisfaction, particularly in its desires for food and physical pleasure from the mother. (Freudians may claim the child desires actual intercourse with its mother, but the situation holds even if the child seeks only the pleasure of being held against the mothers body.) By interfering in the childs relationship to its mother the father arouses the childs hostility, and for the still unrepressed infant, this means a desire to do away with the interference altogether. The urge to destroy the father, however, cannot be consummated or even recognized, and so the psyche, to relieve the terrible dilemma, identifies itself with the Father image, creating a super-ego as a new guide for the self (replacing the id-the urges and desires which led to such a crisis). But what form does this super-ego take? Precisely that of the rules of society, traditionally learned under the fathers guidance.
Trumps 3 and 4 of the Tarot represent the parents in their archetypal roles. But just as the Empress signified the natural world, so the Emperor carries the wider significance of the social world married to nature. He symbolizes the laws of society, both good and bad, and the power that enforces them.
In ancient times, where the Goddess reigned, the king performed a special function. New life can only come from death; therefore, each winter, the Goddesss representatives sacrificed the old king, very often dismembering him and planting the pieces in the ground, thereby mystically fertilizing the earth. Later, when the male-dominated religions took over, the king came to symbolize the rule of law which had clamped a lid of repression on what seemed to the patriarchs as the monstrous and chaotic darkness of the old order. We see this drama (much like Freuds substitution of super-ego for id) in many myths; such as Marduk, national hero of Babylon, killing Tiamat, the original mother of creation, because she is giving birth to monsters. Whether or not we see the old ways as monstrous or the new as civilized, the Emperor symbolizes the abstraction of society replacing the direct experience of nature.
In Rome, the concept of law versus chaos was carried to the point where stability, or law and order to use the modern term, became virtues in themselves, apart from the inherent morality of those laws. No progress can be made in conditions of anarchy (runs the argument); bad laws need to be changed, but first the law must be obeyed at all costs. Any other approach can only destroy society. Today, we see this viewpoint embodied in an abstraction we call the system. The Romans saw it more concretely in the personal figure of the Emperor, whom they described as the father of all his people.
In the Emperors best aspect he indicates the stability of a just society that allows its members to pursue their personal needs and development. The natural world is chaotic; without some kind of social structure we could each spend all our lives fighting to survive. Society allows us both to work together and to benefit from the experience of those who lived before us.
Stability allows spiritual development as well. In many countries society supports the churches (though whether this arrangement furthers spirituality is arguable); in some Eastern countries monks are free to pursue their studies because laymen fill their beggar bowls. Without this social custom they would have to spend their time working to get bread.
In its more negative aspects the Emperor represents the power of unjust laws in a society where stability takes precedence over morality. Once we establish law and order as supreme then a corrupt ruler becomes a disaster. But if the entire system is corrupt, producing only bad rulers, then stability becomes the enemy of morality. The value of the symbol of the Emperor depends a very great deal on time and place. In an unjust society the Emperor's power hinders, rather than helps, personal development. A great many people have gone to gaol for attacking unjust laws.
Even at its best, however, the Emperor remains limited. Over the spontaneity of the Empress he has laid a network of repression. If we lose touch with our passions then life becomes cold and barren. The Rider pack Emperor (see Fig. 5a) is drawn as old and stiff, dressed in iron, representing the sterility of a life rigidly governed by rules. The river which flowed so powerfully through the Empresss garden has here become a thin stream, barely able to penetrate a lifeless desert.
The cards other symbolism reflects its dual aspects. He holds an **ankh**, Egyptian symbol of life, to indicate that under the law he bears the power of life and death, and will hopefully use it well. Four rams, symbols of Aries, adorn his throne while at the crowns peak he bears the sign of Aries (unfortunately resembling a propellor). Now, Aries symbolizes force, aggression and war, but as the first sign of the zodiac it also signifies the new life of spring, which can emerge from the stability of a just society.
As the middle card of the first line of the Major Arcana the Emperor represents a crucial test. In the process of growing up it is indeed the rules of society that many people find most difficult to surmount. We must absorb these rules, as well as our societys traditions and beliefs, then go beyond them to find a personal code of conduct. This does not mean the attitude rules are made to be broken. People who feel compelled to flaunt all laws remain as bound to those laws as the person who follows them blindly.
Because of the fathers role in teaching us acceptably social behaviour, people who are trapped at the level of the Emperor are often people who have never really accepted the ordinary humanity of their father. They may recognize it rationally but it disturbs and haunts them. Similar problems plague those people for whom the Empress remains their mothers, rather than their own, passions and sensuality.
The idea of the Emperor as that of the limited values of social structure arises mainly from Waite and his followers. The picture on the right at the start of this section, from Paul Foster Cases Builders of the Adytum (BOTA) deck drawn by Jessie Burns Parke, illustrates another tradition. Here the Emperor symbolizes the sum total of spiritual knowledge. He is drawn in profile (this is much more common than the Rider pack full-face image), linking him to the Kabbalist image for God as the 'Ancient of Days', a seated king in profile. (The Ancient's face was never visible, only his crown with a radiance beneath.)
The Emperor's arms and legs form an equilateral triangle over a cross, the alchemical sign for fire. This figure is later reversed (in Waite as well as Case) in the Hanged Man. The BOTA Emperor sits on a cube rather than a throne. Also an esoteric symbol, the cube symbolizes both the world and the Tarot itself, as well as the Hebrew alphabet and the paths of the Tree of Life. The symbolism arises from the fact that a cube contains twelve edges, six faces, three axes, and of course a centre, adding up to twenty-two, the number of trumps, Hebrew letters, and paths. And because the Tree of Life is held to represent all creation the cube symbolizes the universe.
In readings the Emperor indicates (following the Rider pack image) the power of society, its laws and especially its authority to enforce those laws. The appearance of the trump indicates an encounter with the law. Again, the good or bad qualities depend on the context.
More personally the Emperor can signify a time of stability and order in a person's life, hopefully opening up creative energy. He also can indicate a specific person who holds great power, either objective or emotional, over the subject. This is very often the father, but it can also be a husband or lover, especially for those people who treat their lovers as substitute fathers to whom they surrender control of their lives. I have seen readings so dominated by the Emperor that all of life's possibilities become stunted and unfulfilled.
As a card of personal qualities, the Emperor can indicate the ability to defend one's territory, to create firm boundaries and vigorously maintain them. He symbolizes a rationalist approach to issues, one that values analysis and measurement over emotion and intuition.","### Reversed
Like the Empress reversed, the Emperor, when upside down, receives those elements complementary to his qualities when he is the right way up. He is, in Waite’s terms, ‘benevolence and compassion’; new life in a stony desert. But the pendulum can swing too far. The reversed Emperor can signify immaturity, and the inability to make harsh decisions and carry them through.",The Emperor,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1583,9289
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_4_the_hierophant,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_4,"## The Hierophant
In most Tarot decks trump 5 is called either the Pope or the High Priest, terms which connect it by name as well as picture to trump 2, the archetype of inner truth. Waite wrote that he rejected Pope because the title suggested a very specific example of the trumps general idea. The name Hierophant belonged to the high priest of the Greek Eleusinian mysteries. Now, Waite describes his card as symbolizing the outer way of churches and dogma. But his use of the mystery term suggests another interpretation, one more favoured by those who see the Tarot as a secret doctrine of occult practices rather than a more general embodiment of human patterns. This interpretation is dramatically portrayed in the picture of the Hierophant from Aleister Crowleys *Book of Thoth*, drawn by Frieda Harris. Here the trump signifies initiation into a secret doctrine, such as the various orders and lodges which flourished around the turn of the century and which have undergone a revival in England and America. The Order of the Golden Dawn, to which Waite and Crowley at one time both belonged, possibly originated the term 'Hierophant' for trump 5.
These two meanings, 'outer way' and 'secret doctrine', appear contradictory on the most elementary level. In reality, they are very similar. Whether the two acolytes are being admitted to the Church or to an occult society, they are still entering a doctrine, with a set of beliefs which they must learn and accept before they can gain entrance. There is of course a fundamental difference between say, the catechism and the rituals of the Golden Dawn. For both, however, the trump indicates an education and a tradition. Therefore, if we see the first line as describing the development of the personality then the Hierophant, coming after the natural world and society, indicates the intellectual tradition of the person's particular society, and his or her education in that tradition.
Following Waite's interpretation (and thinking specifically of the Western pope) we can see the Hierophant as a companion to the Emperor. The word 'pope' means 'father', and like the Roman Emperor the Pope is seen as a wise father guiding his children. Together, they share responsibility for humanity, the one providing physical needs, the other guiding spiritual growth. In one of the earliest treatises urging separation of Church and State, Dante argued that the two functions must not be combined for fear of corruption. However, he never questioned the idea that the Church is responsible for our souls.
Today, many people do not understand the basic idea of a priesthood. Our democratic age rejects the notions of an intermediary between an individual and God. Note, however, that the Hierophant can also symbolize the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' or any other elite leading the masses where they cannot go themselves. Originally the special function of the priests was evident; they spoke to the gods through the oracles, an often terrifying practice, and most people quite happily let someone else do it for them. When Christianity rejected such graphic and immediate connection to God, the idea of the priest became, like the Emperor, more abstract. Basically, it depends on the notion that most people do not really care much about God. The average person is happiest following worldly pursuits, money, family and politics. There are, however, certain people who, by temperament, feel very directly the spirit that runs through all our lives. Called to the priesthood by their own inner awareness, these people can speak to God for us. More important, they can speak to *us*, interpreting Gods law so we may live proper lives, and eventually, after death, receive our reward of returning to God. After the resurrection we ourselves will dwell in sight of God. In life, however, we need the priests to guide us.
So runs the argument. Even if we agree with the principle, in practice it tends to break down. People become priests for all sorts of reasons - ambition, family pressure, etc. - while those who do feel a genuine calling to communicate with God may show very little talent for communicating with people. Moreover, like the social institutions of the Emperor, the religious institutions of the Hierophant can easily become corrupted by the authority given them, so that the priests see their power as an end in itself, prizing obedience above enlightenment. Obviously, the position of defending a doctrine will attract doctrinaire people.
Perhaps, however, we reject the idea of a guiding priesthood for a more subtle reason. Ever since the Reformation a notion that has gained greater and greater force in the West is that of the individuals ultimate responsibility for him or herself. The whole idea of an outer doctrine, a code of rules and beliefs accepted on faith, depends on the assumption that most people prefer to have someone else tell them what to do and think. This may very well be true. To really discover God inside yourself you must undergo some uncomfortable confrontations with your own psyche. Similarly, to decide for yourself what is the moral thing to do in all situations might require a constant agony of choice. Nevertheless, many people today simply cannot accept either society or a Church bearing the ultimate responsibility for their lives.
Perhaps the interpretation of the Hierophant as representing secret doctrines suits our age better. For then the doctrine does not tell us what to do, but instead gives us direction to begin working on ourselves. And the Tarot, as we saw with the Magician, sets itself against all Churches by leading us to personal salvation in this life. For Crowley the Hierophant represents initiation as the means through which the individual becomes united with the universe.
The form and doctrine of the initiation change with each world age; having lasted nearly two thousand years, the current Piscean Age is coming to a close, so that the Hierophant is due to change, as will all strictly human relationships. Crowley comments that only the future can tell us what the new 'current of initiation' will be. But the basic quality of initiation as a merging with the cosmos always remains the same.
In the BOTA version of the Hierophant (as in the Rider pack) the crossed keys at the Hierophant's feet are gold and silver, representing the outer and inner ways, the sun and moon, the Magician and the High Priestess, which the doctrine teaches us to combine. In the Rider pack card both keys are gold, indicating that the dark side is hidden from those who follow the outer doctrine.
In the Waite-Smith imagery no veil blocks the entrance to the Church, as in the temple of the High Priestess. But the pillars are a dull grey. Those who enter here may receive protection from personal choice, but they will not pierce the secrets of duality. The unconscious remains closed. In many Tarot decks, the High Priestess holds not a scroll but a small book, locked. And the keys of the Hierophant do not fit that tantalizing lock.
Still, we must not think that the outer doctrine of religion serves no purpose to the seeker. Like the general education, of which it is a particular example, it gives the individual a firm tradition in which to root his or her personal development. The modern Western phenomenon of a kind of eclectic mysticism, drawing inspiration from all religions, is an extremely unusual development. This is based, possibly, on global awareness plus the view of religion as a psychological state divorced from science and history. Thus we see religion as an experience rather than an explanation of the universe and accept that all religious experiences are valid, whatever contradictions they show on the surface. While this idea opens great possibilities, many people have noted its potential shallowness. The fact is, throughout the centuries, the great mystics have always spoken from deep within a tradition. The Kabbalists were thoroughly Jewish, Thomas à Kempis a complete Christian, and the Sufis bowed to Mecca with all other orthodox Muslims. In its best aspect the Hierophant (as outer doctrine) can give us a place to start in creating a personal awareness of God.
One further aspect of the card's symbolism deserves special attention. The position of the three people (that is, a large figure presiding over two smaller ones on either side) introduces a motif that repeats itself, like the two pillars of the High Priestess, throughout the Major Arcana, and is resolved in Judgement and the world. The very next two cards after trump 5 repeat the motif, with the angel over the Lovers, and the charioteer of the Chariot over the black and white sphinxes.
We can see this trio as an emblem of the idea of a triad, such as the Christian trinity, or the triune picture of the mind: the id/ego/super-ego of Freud, or the conscious/unconscious/super-conscious of the three lines of the Major Arcana. To understand the meaning of the image we must return to the High Priestess. She sits between two pillars symbolizing the dualities of life. She herself signifies one side, the Magician the other. The Hierophant initiates two acolytes into his church. We see, therefore, that the Hierophant and the Lovers and the Chariot all represent attempts to mediate between the opposing poles of life and find some way, not to resolve them, but simply to hold them in balance. A religious doctrine, with its moral codes and explanations for lifes most basic questions, does just that. If we surrender ourselves to a Church the contradictions of life all become answered; but not resolved.
In reading the card signifies Churches, doctrines, and education in general. Psychologically it can indicate orthodoxy, conformity to societys ideas and codes of behaviour, as well as, more subtly, a surrender of responsibility. The Emperor symbolized the rules themselves and their official enforcers; the Hierophant indicates our own inner sense of obedience.","### Reversed
Reversed, the card means unorthodoxy, especially mental — forming original ideas. It can also, however, mean gullibility and this idea suggests another virtue of the card when it is the right way up. A society builds its intellectual tradition over hundreds of years. Those who accept that tradition receive from it a standard by which to judge new ideas and information. Those who reject it must find their own ways and can easily get lost in superficial ideas. There are many people who, having given up the dogma forced on them as children, fall into some new dogma, a cult or some extremist political group, just as rigid and perhaps more shallow. Having rejected tradition they have not really rejected the Hierophant. They have not accepted the responsibility of truly finding their own way.",The Hierophant,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1658,9995
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_4_the_lovers,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_4,"## THE LOVERS
Of the various changes Arthur Waite and Pamela Smith made in traditional Tarot designs, the card of the Lovers remains the most dramatic. Where the Tarot de Marseilles (on the right, above) shows a young man struck by Cupids arrow and forced to choose between two women, the Rider pack shows a mature man and a single woman presided over by an angel. Further, while most decks indicate only a social situation, the Rider pack image clearly suggests the Garden of Eden, or rather, a new Garden of Eden, with the trees bringing enlightenment rather than the Fall.
The earlier version of trump 6 sometimes bears the title The Choice, and in divinatory readings means an important choice between two desires. Because one woman is fair and the other dark, a symbolism traditional in Europe where darkness always indicates evil and women in general indicate temptation, the choice was seen as between something respectable but perhaps dull, and something greatly desired but morally improper. The card can refer to a minor choice or even to a major crisis in a persons life. We see this ancient symbolism today in the various novels and films of middle-aged, middle-class men tempted to give up their loved but rather boring wives for a younger wilder woman.
The choice can, in fact, extend to a persons whole life. Even those people who never question the boundaries of their middle-class respectability have made a choice as much as the life-long criminal. And there are many people who outwardly live socially acceptable lives yet inwardly fight constant torments of desire, fighting urges to adultery, or violence, or simply a desire to leave home and become a wandering tramp.
On the esoteric level the choice between the light and dark woman indicates the choice between the outer path (symbolized in the Rider pack by the Hierophant), where your life is laid out for you, and the inner path of the occultist, which can lead to a confrontation with your hidden desires. The Church labelled magicians as devil worshippers, and in Christian allegories the dark woman usually stood for Satan.
These meanings all see the choice between light and dark in the widest possible terms. In the context of the first line of trumps we can see it in a much more specific way, that of the first real choice a person makes independently of his or her parents. Until the sexual urge rouses itself most people are content to act out their parents expectations for them. The sexual urge, however, points us where it wants to go. As a result we begin to break away in other areas as well. It is very rare that the partners our parents would choose for us are the ones we would choose for ourselves. If the difference is too extreme, or the parents too controlling, then the person can face a painful choice.
Paul Douglas has commented that the dark-haired woman, who appears much older, is the boys mother, and the choice is whether to stay under her protection or strike out on his own. Those who believe, with Freud, that a boys first desire is directed towards his mother will see here a classic Oedipal dilemma. One part of the personality wishes to maintain the hidden fantasy life of a union with the mother, while another wishes to find a true love in the reality of the boys own generation. But we do not have to accept the Freudian doctrine to see the wider implications of this choice.
Whether or not the boy secretly desires his mother the life lived under the parents' protection is safe and comfortable. But he (or she, for girls basically face the same questions, though sometimes in different forms) can never become a true individual without making a break. And nothing indicates this more strongly than sexuality.
Therefore, the traditional version of trump 6 represents adolescence. Not only does sexuality emerge at this time but also intellectual and moral independence. Cards 3, 4 and 5 represented us as shaped by the great forces of nature, society, and parents. In card 6 the individual emerges, a true personality with its own ideas and purposes, able to make important choices based, not on parental orders, but on its own assessment of desires and responsibilities.
These meanings belong to the cards traditional structure. In designing his own version of the Lovers Waite addressed a different question. What functions do sex and love ultimately serve in a persons life? And what deep meanings can we find in the powerful drama of two people joining their hearts and bodies? Waite called his picture, the card of human love, here exhibited as part of the way, the truth, and the life.
The sexual drive leads us away from isolation. It pushes us to form vital relationships with other people, and finally opens the way to love. Through love we not only achieve a unity with someone else, but we are given a glimpse of the greater meanings and deeper significance of life. In love we give up part of that ego control which isolates us not only from other people but from life itself. Therefore the angel appears above the mans and womans heads, a vision unobtainable to each person individually, but glimpsed by both of them together.
Religion, philosophy, and art have always seized on the symbolism of male and female as representing duality. We have already seen this idea reflected in the Magician and the High Priestess, as well as the Empress and the Emperor. The symbolism here is reinforced by the fact that the Tree of Life, with its Magician like flames, stands behind the man, while the Tree of Knowledge, entwined with the serpent (symbol not of evil but of unconscious wisdom) stands behind the woman. The angel unites these two principles. In traditional teachings men and women are held to contain, within their bodies, separate life principles. Through physical love these principles join together.
Occultists, however, have always recognized both these elements within the self. Today we hear many people say that everyone contains both male and female qualities; usually, however, they are referring to vague ideas of social behaviour, such as aggression and gentleness. When male and female were seen as opposite in their deepest natures the occultist view was much more radical. One way of describing the goal of the Major Arcana is to say it brings out and unites the male and female principles. Therefore, in many decks, the dancer in the World is an hermaphrodite.
According to Kabbalists and Hermetic philosophers all humanity (and indeed, even the Deity) was originally hermaphroditic. Thus, on the outer level, each of us is only half a person and only through love can we find a sense of unity.
We find this same idea in Plato, but with an interesting variation. One of the Platonic myths states that humans were originally double creatures, but of three kinds: male-female, male-male, and female-female. Believing that humans possessed too much power Zeus split them with a thunderbolt, and now each one of us is looking for his or her other half. In contrast to the Jewish and Christian myths Platos story gives equal reality to homosexuals. It reminds us of the danger in the too easy symbolism of male and female as ultimate opposites. The Magician and the High Priestess are mixed very subtly in each of us. And the angel can be evoked by any two lovers. It is not the roles that matter, but the reality of the union.
In the usual Christian interpretation of Genesis Eve bears the greater guilt, not only because she ate first, but because her sensuality tempted Adam to fall. Man supposedly was ruled by reason and woman by desire. This split led some Christians to declare that women had no souls. The whole myth of the Fall, however, with its emphasis on disobedience and punishment, is really meant to serve a repressive morality. Physical passions were seen as dangerous to society and therefore had to be controlled. As Joseph Campbell points out in *The Masks of God*, the ancient goddess religion of Palestine contained the same drama of a serpent, a Tree of Life, and an apple. But in the old story the initiate was given the apple by the goddess to allow him to enter paradise, rather than it being the cause of his expulsion. The ancient Hebrews reversed the myth, partly as a way of branding the old religion as evil, but also because they, like the Babylonians, considered the old ways 'monstrous'.
The Tarot, however, is a path of liberation. The fear that Jahweh expresses, that human beings 'will become like us', is precisely the Tarot's purpose - to fully bring out the divine spark in us and unite it with our conscious selves, to end the duality of God and human and make them one. Therefore, though it keeps much of the same symbolism as Genesis, the Rider pack Lovers subtly reverses the meaning.
Notice that while the man looks at the woman the woman looks at the angel. If the male is indeed reason, then rationality can only reach beyond its limits through the medium of passion. By its nature reason controls and contains, while passion tends to break down all limits. Our tradition has set the body and the rational mind at odds with each other. The Tarot teaches us that we must unite them (a single mountain rises between the two lovers) and that it is not the controlling power of reason that raises the senses to a higher level, but, rather, the other way around.
We can see this in direct psychological terms. Most people are bound within their egos or the masks they present to the world. But if they can surrender to sexual passion, they can, at least for a moment, transcend their isolation. Those who cannot release their egos, even for an instant, misuse sex, and are misused by it. Sex becomes a means of gaining power over someone else, but it never satisfies. When a person rejects the body's desire to release itself with another person the result is depression. The angel has been denied.
At the same time the passions alone cannot bring us to the angel. They need to be guided by the reason as much as the reason needs the passions to set it free. Those who simply go wherever their desires lead them are often thrown from one experience to another.
Paul Foster Case names the angel as Raphael, who presides over the super-conscious. This brings us back to the triune mind; here we learn that the three levels of the mind are not separate and isolated, like the three storeys of a house, but that the super-conscious is actually a product of the conscious and unconscious joined together. The pathway lies through the unconscious because that is where we find the true energy of life. In fact, the super-conscious can be described as the energy of the unconscious brought out and transformed to a higher state. Part of that transformation lies in consciousness giving the energy form, direction, and meaning.
If in the triangular motif the two figures below represent the dualities of life, while the larger figure above symbolizes a mediating force between them, then in trump 6 the mediator is sexual love. When we surrender to it we experience a glimpse of something greater than ourselves. Only a glimpse, and only for a moment; true liberation requires finally a great deal more than passion. But love can help us see the path, and know a little of the joy that waits for us at the end of it. A number of mystics, notably Saint Teresa, have described union with God in terms of sexual ecstasy.
The divinatory meanings for the Waite-Smith image are straightforward. They refer to the importance of love in a persons life and to a specific lover; very often to marriage or a long relationship. The card implies that the particular relationship has been or will prove to be very valuable to the person, leading him or her to a new understanding of life. If some specific problem is being considered in the reading then the Lovers indicates help in some way, either practically through the lovers assistance, or through emotional support. But this is not always true. The Lovers, in the position of the past, especially in relation to cards indicating a refusal to look at the present situation, can indicate a crippling nostalgia for a past love.
The earlier cards all represented archetypes.","### Reversed
When we reversed them we added the missing elements. But here the individual has advanced and now the reversed meaning shows weakness and blocks. It is first of all a destructive love, particularly in a bad marriage. It can refer to romantic or sexual problems that dominate a person’s life, either from difficulties with a specific person, or because the person finds love simply a great problem. Because the Waite-Smith picture indicates a mature love, and the traditional image shows the process of adolescent choice, either version reversed indicates romantic immaturity; the prolonged adolescence that keeps some people involved in childish fantasies long after their bodies have fully matured.",The Lovers,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,2110,12190
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_4_the_chariot,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_4,"## THE CHARIOT
The earlier versions of this card, which showed the Chariot pulled by two horses rather than two sphinxes, derives from a number of historical and mythological sources. Primarily it comes out of the processions given in Rome and other places for a conquering hero, when his chariot carried him through the streets that were filled with cheering citizens. The custom apparently answers some deep psychic need for group participation. We still practise it today, two thousand years later, in the parades given to presidents, generals, and astronauts, with open limousines replacing the chariot.
The Chariot implies more than a great victory. To drive a two horse vehicle at speed requires total control over the animals; the activity serves as a perfect vehicle for the powerful will. Plato, in the *Phaedrus*, refers to the mind as a chariot drawn by a black and white horse, the exact image of the Tarot.
A certain Hindu myth tells of Shiva destroying a triple city of the demons. To do so he requires that all creation be subordinated to his will. The gods make a chariot for Shiva, using not only themselves but the heavens and the Earth as materials. The sun and moon become the wheels and the winds the horses. (The symbol on the front of the Tarot Chariot, like a nut and bolt, or a wheel and axle, is called the lingam and yoni, standing for Shiva, the masculine principle, and Parvati, the feminine principle, united in a single figure. Through the myth's images we learn that spiritual victory over evil comes when we can focus all of nature, as well as the unconscious energy embodied in Shiva himself, through the conscious will.
These two fables show two different aspects of the idea of will. The story of Shiva speaks of a true victory, in which the spirit has found a focus to release its total force. But the *Phaedrus* gives us an image of the triumphant ego, which controls rather than resolves the basic conflicts of life. Those Tarot commentators who see the cards as a group of separate images, each one contributing some vital lesson to our spiritual understanding, tend to give the Chariot its wider meaning. They point out that the Kabbalistic title for the number 7, with all its mystic connotations, is 'Victory'.
In many places, particularly India, the horse became associated with death and funerals. When the rising patriarchy abolished the ritual sacrifice of the king, a horse was killed instead. The horse sacrifice became the most holy, associated with immortality. Even today, horses are used to pull the coffins of great leaders. (A bizarre junction of two aspects of the Chariot was seen in the death of John Kennedy. He was killed in his limousine during a parade, and then a horse-who rebelled against his trainers control-pulled his coffin in the state funeral.) These connections suggest the idea of the souls victory over mortality.
When we look at the cards sequentially we see that 7 is only the victory of the first line of the Major Arcana. It crowns that lines process of maturation, but by necessity it cannot address the great areas of the unconscious and super-conscious. Seen this way the Chariot shows us the developed ego; the lessons of the early cards have been absorbed, the adolescent period of searching and self-creation has been passed, and now we see the mature adult, successful in life, admired by others, confident and content with himself, able to control feelings, and above all, to direct the will.
Like the Magician the Charioteer carries a magic wand. Unlike the Magician he does not raise it above his head to heaven. His power is subordinate to his will. His hands hold no reins. His strong character alone controls the opposing forces in life.
The lingam and yoni indicate his mature sexuality which is under his control. Thus he is not the victim of his emotions and his sexuality contributes to a satisfying life. The glowing square on his chest, a symbol of vibrant nature, links him to the sensual world of the Empress, but the eight pointed star on his crown shows his mental energy directing his passions (symbolists consider the eight pointed star as halfway between the square of the material world and the circle of the spiritual). His chariot looms larger than the town behind indicating that his will is more powerful than the rules of society. However, the fact that his chariot is not in motion indicates that he is not a rebel. The wheels of the chariot rest on water, showing that he draws energy from the unconscious, though the chariot itself, resting on land, separates him from a direct contact with that great force.
We have mentioned the sexual symbolism of the lingam and yoni. While Hindu myth connects horses to death, Freudian dream symbolism connects them to the sexual energy of the libido. By controlling the horses (or sphinxes) the Charioteer controls his instinctive desires.
Various magic signs adorn his body. His skirt bears symbols of ceremonial magic, his belt shows the sign and planets. The two lunar faces on his shoulders are named 'Urin and Thummim', the supposed shoulder plates of the High Priest in Jerusalem and which therefore suggest the Hierophant. At the same time the lunar plates refer to the High Priestess. Note also that the cloth at the back of the chariot suggests the High Priestesss veil; he has set the mystery of the unconscious behind him.
We see, therefore, in the Chariots symbolism all the previous cards of the first line. The wand and symbols indicate the Magician, the water, sphinxes, and veil symbolize the High Priestess, the stars on his canopy recall the Empresss crowns, the city symbolizes the Emperor, the shoulder plates symbolize the Hierophant, and the lingam and yoni symbolize the Lovers. All these forces contribute to the outer personality.
And yet - observe the Chariot with its stone-like qualities. Observe the charioteer himself merging into his stone vehicle. The mind that subordinates all things to conscious will runs the risk of becoming rigid, cut off from the very forces it has learned to control. Observe also that the black and white sphinxes are not reconciled to each other. They look in opposite directions. The charioteer's will holds them together in a tense balance. If that will should fail, the Chariot and its rider will be torn apart.
Paul Douglas has compared the Chariot to Jungs idea of the persona. As we grow up we create a kind of mask to deal with the outside world. If we have dealt successfully with the various challenges of life, then the different aspects symbolized by the other cards will become integrated into this ego-mask. But we can too easily confuse this successful persona with the true self, even to the point that if we try to discard the mask we will fear its loss as a kind of death. This is why the second line of the Major Arcana, which deals precisely with the release of the self from its outer masks, bears Death as its next to last card.
So far we have considered the Chariot as an emblem of personal maturity. But the idea of human will extends beyond the individual. With its images of the mind subduing and utilizing the forces of life the Chariot is a perfect symbol for civilization, which creates order out of the chaos of nature by using the natural world as the raw materials for its agriculture and cities. One of the chief Kabbalistic connotations for the card extends this idea. By its connection with the Hebrew letter Iain the Chariot carries the quality of speech. Speech has always seemed to humans to represent the rational mind and its dominance over nature. As far as we know only humans possess language (though chimpanzees have shown themselves capable of learning human sign language, and whales and dolphins may possess developed languages of their own) and we may say that speech separates us from the animal. Adam gained control over the beasts in Eden by speaking their names. Most important, humans use language to transmit the information that allows civilization to continue.
However, just as the ego is limited, so is speech. First of all, speech restricts our experience of reality. By forming a description of the world, by giving everything a label, we erect a barrier between ourselves and experience. When we look at a tree, we do not feel the impact of a living organism; rather, we think tree and move on. The label has replaced the thing itself. Also, by relying too much on this rational quality of language we ignore experiences that cannot be expressed in words. We have already seen how the High Priestess signifies intuitive wisdom beyond language. Certain experiences, especially mystical union with spirit, cannot be described. Language can only hint at them with metaphors and fables. People who rely totally on speech have even gone so far as to insist that non-verbal experiences, or experiences which cannot be measured by psychological tests, do not exist. This is simply because they cannot be scientifically described. Such dogmatism receives its perfect symbol in the charioteers merging with his stone wagon.
So far we have considered every symbol in the picture except, perhaps, the most obvious one: the two sphinxes. Waite borrowed this innovation from Eliphas Levi, the great pioneer of Kabbalistic Tarot. Like the two pillars of the High Priestess, or the black and white horses they replace, the sphinxes signify the dualities and contradictions of life. Once again, we see the triangular motif. Here the mediating force is will-power.
The use of sphinxes instead of horses suggests several deeper meanings. The sphinx in Greek legend was a riddler, presenting the mystery of life to the people of Thebes. The myth tells us that the sphinx seized the young men of the city and asked them the following riddle: ""What creature walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?"" Those who could not answer were devoured. Now, the answer is ""man"" who crawls as a baby, walks upright as an adult, and uses a cane in old age. The implication is clear. If you do not understand your basic humanity, with its strengths and weaknesses, then life will destroy you. The Chariot symbolizes maturity, accepting the limits of life, plus the faculty of speech, that is, rational understanding, which is used to define existence and therefore to control it.
But a further meaning lurks here. The man who answered the sphinxs riddle was Oedipus, who arrived in Thebes after killing his father. Freuds emphasis on incest has diverted attention from the deeper message of the Oedipus story. Oedipus was the perfect image of the successful man. Not only did he save Thebes from a menace and become king of the city but he did so by his understanding of life. He knew what man was. Yet he did not know himself. His own inner reality remained closed to him until the gods forced him to confront it. And the gods *did* force him. If the oracles had not spoken first to his father and then to him, Oedipus would never have done the things he did. Therefore, though he understood the outer meaning of man's life he did not understand either who he really was, or his relation to the gods who controlled his life. And these two subjects are precisely the concerns of the second and third lines of the Major Arcana. In the second we go beyond the ego to find the true self. In the third we deal openly with the archetypal forces of existence and reach at last a full integration of those dualities which the charioteer was able to dominate but never reconcile.
The divinatory meanings of the Chariot derive from its powerful will. In a reading the card signifies that the person is successfully controlling some situation through the force of his or her personality. The card implies that a situation contains some contradictions and that these have not been brought together but simply held under control. This is not to stress too highly the negative undertones of the card. When it is the right way up the Chariot basically means success; the personality in charge of the world around it. If it appears as the outcome in a reading dealing with problems then it indicates victory.","### Reversed
Reversed, the card's inherent contradictions gain greater force. The Chariot upside down implies that the approach of will-power has proven unsuccessful, and the situation has got out of control. Unless the person can find some other approach to the difficulties, he or she faces disaster. Will-power alone cannot always sustain us. Like Oedipus we must sometimes learn to give way to the gods.",The Chariot,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,2091,12171
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_5_strength,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_5,"## STRENGTH
Waites change of the Lovers was the most obvious of his Tarot alterations; his switch of Strength with Justice remains the most controversial. He himself gives no real reason for the change. 'For reasons which satisfy myself, this card has been interchanged with that of Justice, which is usually numbered eight. As the variation carries nothing which will signify to the reader there is no cause for explanation.' The reasons are certainly more than personal. Paul Foster Case placed Strength as 8 and Justice as 11. Aleister Crowley kept their original numbers, but assigned them the Hebrew letters that would go with switching the cards. Both probably followed the Order of the Golden Dawn, whose secret Tarot deck also switched the two cards.
This connection to a secret order suggests the idea of initiation. Now, the Golden Dawn, of course, did not originate the practice of initiation, though it claimed to receive its specific rituals directly from spirit instructors. Initiation goes back thousands of years and is seen all over the world, from Egyptian temples to the Australian desert. It represents a special means of psychological transformation - the very subject of the Tarots middle line. By referring Justice and the cards around it to this ancient idea we gain a wider understanding of the Tarot as an experience.
It is worth considering the implications of the old arrangement of trumps. The image of Justice suggests weighing your life in the balance. The second line takes us away from the outer achievements of the first and into the self. Thus Justice in the first position would mean an assessment of what your life has meant to you, followed by a decision to search inward for greater meaning. Obviously, this fits very nicely. But if Justice comes first then all these things occur rationally; the assessment arises as a conscious reaction to dissatisfaction. How much more powerful this assessment appears when it arises from within, forced on us by the powerful vision of the Wheel of Fortune. The double-edged sword of Justice implies action, a response to the knowledge gained in the assessment. The idea of response leads directly to the Hanged Man. If Justice came first then the Hermit would follow it. As a seeker of wisdom, the Hermit would also represent a valid response to Justice. But again, if we allow that wisdom to come before Justice, then the Hanged Man shows a response from deep inside.
Now consider Strength in both places. The picture shows a woman taming a lion. Briefly, the image suggests the energy of the unconscious released and calmed, tamed by the direction of conscious understanding. Such an idea would easily belong in the middle position. We would then describe the card as the central test of the whole line. And certainly the peacefulness and great reversal of the Hanged Man would follow Strength perfectly.
But we can also see Strength as the qualities vital for beginning the line. The search inward cannot be accomplished by the ego. We need to confront feelings and desires long hidden from our conscious thoughts. If we attempt to transform ourselves by a wholly rational process we create another kind of persona. Something very like this in fact happens quite often. Many people feel a lack of spontaneity in their lives. They look around them or read books on psychology, and observe, with a certain jealousy, or even shame at their own repressions, the characteristics of spontaneous people. And then, rather than follow the fearful process of releasing their hidden fears and desires, they carefully imitate spontaneity. They have extended the Chariot to a new domain.
By making Strength number 8 we set it against the Chariot, as a different kind of power, not the egos will, but the inner Strength to confront yourself calmly and without fear. The mysteries can be brought out because we have found the Strength to face them. The lion signifies all the feelings, fears, desires, and confusions suppressed by the ego in its attempt to control life. The charioteer drew upon his inner feelings as a source of energy, but was always careful to direct that energy where he consciously decided it should go. Strength allows the inner passions to emerge, as the first step in going beyond the ego.
On a very simple level we can see this emergence of suppressed feelings in the person who allows him or herself to act childishly, to weep or scream; in short, to do all those things that previously seemed foolish or embarrassing. On a deeper level the lion symbolizes the whole force of personality, usually smoothed over by the demands of civilized life. Strength releases this energy in order to use it as a kind of fuel, propelling us along the inner path of the Hermit. This purpose can only be accomplished because the lion is tamed at the same time that it is released. Strength opens up the personality like Pandora opening her box. It does so, however, with a sense of peace, a love of life itself, and a great confidence in the final result. Unless we truly believe that the process of self-discovery is a joyous one we will never follow it through.
The symbolism of the pictures and numbers reinforces the comparison of Strength and the Chariot. The Chariot shows a man and Strength shows a woman. Traditionally, of course, these represent rationality and emotion, aggression and surrender. Also traditionally, the Chariots number 7 belongs to male magic, the number 8 to female. This symbolism arises from anatomy. The male body contains seven openings (counting the nose as one), the female eight. Also, the male body possesses seven points, the arms and legs, the head, the centre, and the penis. The female possesses eight, the breasts replacing the penis.
What do we mean by male and female magic? Esoteric theory considers sexual energy as a manifestation of the energy principles underlying the entire universe; male and female being similar to the positive and negative poles of electro-magnetism. Through manipulation of this bipolar energy, magic power results. The occultist considers these principles a science, no more, and no less, mysterious than the modern scientists manipulation of atomic energy. We can describe the Rider pack Lovers as a schematic energy diagram. Therefore, the Chariot and Strength belong together esoterically as the practical manifestation of the principles symbolized in the Magician and the High Priestess.
Psychologically they also embody two kinds of power. Our society emphasizes the masculine force of control; conquest, dominating the world through reason and will. But the feminine qualities of intuition and spontaneous emotion are far from weakness. To release your deepest emotions with love and faith requires great courage as well as strength.
The Fool comes in here. Only by a kind of psychic leap can we move from the conscious to the unconscious. And only a fool would make such a jump, for why give up success, control? The gods forced Oedipus; what inner needs will force the rest of us?
Strengths position, as first in the line, links the card to the Magician, as does the infinity sign, another reference to 8, above her head. The reversal of sex indicates a joining of aspects from both the male and female archetypes. The Magicians active involvement with life has been modified by the inner peace implied in the High Priestess.
The womans sensual figure, her blonde hair, and the flower belt linking her to the lion, connect the card to the Empress as well. The Empress represents natural instincts and passion; again we see the image of emotional energy, the animal desires as some Tarot commentators call it, released and tamed. Waite describes the flower belt as a second infinity sign, with one loop around the womans waist, the other around the lions neck. We can describe Strength as the Magician united with the Empress; that is, the Magicians power of consciousness and direction has mingled with the Empresss sensuality, giving it a sense of purpose and leading to the Hermit. Notice that for the first line 1 plus 3 equals 4, the Emperor. For the second line 1 plus 3 becomes multiplied by 2; the inner truth of the High Priestess.
Another aspect of the trump carries this unity of 1 and 3 still further. The Hebrew letter given by Case and others to Strength is Teth. Teth refers Kebbalisitically to snake; but the Hebrew for snake also means 'magic'. All over the world people have made this connection; from the snakes on Hermes's magic wand to the kundalini power of Tantric occultism in India and Tibet. And the snake, in kundalini and elsewhere, stands for sexuality. The Tarot, as we know from the serpent twined around the Tree of Life behind the woman on the Lovers, considers sexuality to be a force towards enlightenment. If, esoterically, Strength stands for the actual practice of sexual magic, psychologically it refers again to releasing that energy bound up in our strongest feelings. When we compare Strength with the Devil we will see that the release here is actually a partial one. The lion is controlled and directed rather than allowed to take the self wherever it wants to go.
In alchemy the lion stands for gold, the sun, and sulphur. Sulphur is a lower element and gold (in alchemy) the highest. The process by which sulphur becomes gold is precisely the process of transforming the lower self. And the design of Temperance, the last card of the line, with its liquid poured from one cup to another, depicts the alchemical goal of blending the opposites into a new and more meaningful existence.
Those who find life a matter of strict control, who see the unconscious as a 'moral sewer' of repressions (as Jung characterized the narrow Freudian view), and find the passions a torment, will see the lion as natural forces which the rational mind must overcome. Some older Tarot decks, including the Visconti, showed Heracles killing the Nemean lion. The passions conquered by reason. But the lion also stood for Christ, the radiant power of God. Those who allow the unconscious energy within themselves to emerge, guiding it with love and a faith in life, will discover that the energy is not a destructive beast but the same spirit force drawn down through the lightning rod of the Magician.
In readings the card of Strength indicates the ability to face life, and particularly some difficult problem or time of change, with hope and eagerness. It shows a person strong from within, experiencing life passionately yet peacefully, without being controlled or carried away by those passions. The card represents the finding of the strength to begin or continue some difficult project, despite fear and emotional strain.
If Strength appears in connection with the Chariot it can signify an alternative to force and will-power, especially, of course, if the Chariot is reversed. The two cards can also symbolize complementary sides, the best configuration being Strength in the position of the inner self, and the Chariot in the position of the outer (the vertical and horizontal lines of a cross). Then we see a person who acts powerfully but with a sense of calm.","### Reversed

Strength reversed indicates first of all weakness. The courage to face life fails and the person feels overwhelmed and pessimistic. It signifies also a torment from within. The bestial side of the lion breaks away from the unity of spirit and sensuality. The passions become the enemy, threatening to destroy the conscious personality and the life it has built up for itself.",Strength,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1876,11150
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_5_the_hermit,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_5,"## THE HERMIT
Like the six-pointed star within the Hermit's lantern, the idea of the Hermit goes in two directions; one inner, one outer. Primarily, the card means a withdrawal from the outer world for the purpose of activating the unconscious mind. We see this process symbolized in the downward pointing 'water' triangle, as the alchemists called it. But the Hermit also signifies a teacher who will show us how to begin this process, and will help us find our way. The upward pointing 'fire' triangle symbolizes this special guide, who might be an occult teacher, a therapist, our own dreams, or even a spirit guide evoked from within the self.
The image of the Hermit occupied a special place in the medieval imagination. Living in the woods or the desert, totally withdrawn from all the normal concerns of humanity, the hermit presented an alternative to the Church. The European version of a yogi ascetic, he demonstrated the possibility of approaching God through personal experience. People often looked upon the hermits as living saints, and attributed magic powers to them, in the way that yoga disciples will tell wonderful stories about their masters.
Though the hermit withdrew from society he or she (Women often became hermits and the medieval hatred of women sometimes became a veneration of a particular woman who had supposedly conquered the evil of her sex.) did not withdraw from humanity. Among other functions, they gave shelter and sometimes blessings to travellers. Countless stories, especially the Grail legends, depict the hermit who acts as a giver of wisdom to the knight on a spiritual quest. Again, we see the Hermit's double image: example and guide.
The Hermit image has persisted long after the special practice has died away. The transcendental philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson travelled days through remote Scotland to find the cabin of Thomas Carlyle. Emerson's friend, Henry David Thoreau, himself lived in a cabin at Walden Pond to find a sense of himself and of nature. He then wrote about it as an example to others. Nietzsche's *Dus Sprach Zarathustra* enshrined the Hermit's image; the book begins with Zarathustra's return after achieving personal transformation. And today, countless people have given themselves to Eastern gurus in the hope that these hermit-like teachers can transform their lives.
For those who cannot find an actual guide the psyche will often provide one. Jung and his followers have described their patients' many dreams of wise old men guiding them on mysterious journeys into the psyche. In many cases dream analysis discovered that the dream guide actually stood for the therapist. The unconscious can recognize a Hermit teacher before the conscious mind can.
The great thirteenth-century Kabbalist, Abraham Abulafia, described three levels of Kabbalah. The first was doctrine; that which can be learned from texts. The second came from the direct guidance given by a personal teacher, while the third, the most developed, was the direct experience of ecstatic union with God. These three levels connect very directly to the Tarot, not only in the three lines, but in three specific trumps which together form an isosceles triangle. The first level we see in the Hierophant; the third, directly below the Hierophant, one level removed, appears in the joyous child of card 19, the Sun. The second level, however, comes not in the card between them, the Hanged Man, but on the other end of the pattern, as the second card in the second line, the Hermit.
Doctrine and mystery both come as the end of a process; doctrine because you first must arrange your life before you can approach the study of a special way (Kabbalists often restricted certain important texts to people over thirty-five), and ecstasy because you first must pass the archetypal confrontation with darkness and mystery. A guide, however, appears at the very start of the journey, after the traveller has found the Strength to begin.
As an emblem of personal development, rather than a guide, the Hermit signifies the idea that only by withdrawing from the outer world can we awaken the inner self. Those who see the Tarot in two halves, with the Wheel of Fortune as the mid-point, view the Hermit as the period of contemplation before the Wheel of Life turns towards its second half. When we view the Tarot in lines of seven we see that this withdrawal, and the vision of the Wheel itself, are steps towards a greater goal.
We see the Hermit on a cold lonely peak. He has left the world of the senses to enter the mind. This image of the mind as stark and chill conveys only a partial truth, or rather, an illusion. The mind is rich with symbols, with joy, with the light and love of the spirit. But before we can apprehend these things we must first experience the mind as a silent alternative to the noisy world of the senses. For shamans the barren peak is often a direct reality. In places as far apart as Siberia and the American South-West shaman candidates go alone into the wilderness to seek the spirit guides who will teach them how to heal.
The Hermit signifies a transition. Through the techniques of meditation, or psychic discipline, or analysis, we allow the hidden parts of the psyche to begin to speak to us. Later we will experience a sense of rebirth, first as an angel (the eternal part of the self, beyond the ego), then later, more deeply felt, as a free child riding forth from the garden of past experience. For now, the path belongs to the image of the wise old man, alone, supported and warmed by his stiff grey cloak of contemplation.
The symbol of the lantern returns us to the Hermit as guide and teacher. He holds the light out to us, indicating his willingness to lead us and our ability to find the way if we will only use the Strength we have to follow. In some decks the Hermit conceals his lantern under his cloak, and then it symbolizes the light of the unconscious hidden under the cloak of the conscious mind. By making it visible, yet within a lantern, the Rider pack indicates that we release the light through a definite process of self-awareness, and that this process is available to anyone.
We have seen the star both as a symbol of the Hermit as teacher, and also as a light of the unconscious, beckoning us to discover its secrets. It further signifies the goal of resolving the opposites of life. The water and fire triangles traditionally represent not only two elements usually opposed, but also male and female united in a single form.
The Hermit's staff suggests a wizard's staff, and therefore the magic wand of the Magician. Whereas the Fool used the wand instinctively, the Hermit leans on it as a conscious support. It therefore symbolizes the teaching which helps open the inner awareness.
Directly below the High Priestess the Hermit relates to her principle of withdrawal, indicating again that we must in some sense leave the outer world if we wish to work on ourselves. As with Strength the second line reverses the sexual archetype. The role symbolism here teaches us is that a deliberate mental effort, based on specific techniques and teachings, takes us beyond the locked up intuition of the High Priestess's closed temple. The waters of that temple are not fully released; the veil remains in place until the lightning of the Tower, below the Hermit, tears it open. Under the influence of trump 9, however, the unconscious speaks to us from behind the veil, through symbols, dreams, and visions.
The distinction between male-female symbolism and the reality of individual people leads us to some important realizations about archetypes. We tend to see hermits and teachers as wise old men, even in our dreams, because our five-thousand-year-old patriarchy has so impressed this image on our minds. In earlier times, the guides were most often women, as representatives of the Great Goddess, and even in our age such women as Madame Blavatsky have served this ancient function. The fact that our dreams often choose wise old men demonstrates the very important fact that the unconscious too draws its material from the cultural background of the individual dreamer. Many people view archetypes as rigid fixed images shared by all people at all times. Rather, archetypes are tendencies for the mind to form certain kinds of images, such as that of a guide, and the specific form an image takes will depend very much on a person's cultural background and experience. Medieval Grail initiations and Australian desert rites follow the same archetypal pattern; it underlies them like a grid. Yet the outer form of that pattern varies immensely.
The divinatory meanings for the Hermit derive from both its aspects. On the one hand it symbolizes a withdrawal from outer concerns. The person may physically remove himself, but this is not really necessary. What matters is the inner transfer of attention from 'getting and spending' as Wordsworth called our worldly activities, to a person's inner needs. It therefore requires an emotional withdrawal from other people and from activities once thought to be all-important. The card carries within it a sense of deliberate purpose, of withdrawing to work on self-development. In connection with this sense of purpose and with the picture of an old man the card symbolizes maturity, and a knowledge of what really matters in a person's life.
The card can also signify assistance from a definite guide, sometimes as indicated above, a psychic guide from within, but more often a real person who will help you in your self-discoveries. Sometimes we do not ourselves recognize that such a guide exists for us. If the Hermit appears in a Tarot reading it may be wise to look carefully at the people around you. If you are involved in helping others find understanding then the Hermit can symbolize you in your role as guide and teacher.","### Reversed
When we reverse the card we corrupt the idea of withdrawal. In the same way that the High Priestess reversed can mean a fear of life, the Hermit reversed can indicate a fear of other people. If we withdraw from society as a retreat then the fact of withdrawal becomes more and more dominant, leading to phobias and paranoia. As with other trumps the negative and positive aspects of the Hermit depend on the context. The Hermit reversed can sometimes simply mean that at this moment the person needs to become involved with other people.

Because the card, when the right way up, suggests maturity the Hermit reversed can sometimes indicate a Peter Pan attitude to life. The person hangs on to basically meaningless activities, or else imitates childlike enthusiasm (like the imitation of spontaneity) as a way of avoiding the responsibilities of doing something with his or her life. I first encountered this interpretation for the Hermit reversed in a reading given by a man in New York to a friend of mine; I have since found it useful in many situations. Interestingly, I met the man through another friend who looked on the reader as a personal guide in her spiritual development.",The Hermit,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1670,9873
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_5_wheel_of_fortune,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_5,"## THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE
Like certain other trump cards (most notably Death) the Wheel of Fortune derives from a medieval homily. The Church considered pride the greatest of sins, for in pride you set yourself before Christ. One lesson against pride was the idea of a great king falling from power. In many versions of the King Arthur legend, the king dreams or sees before him on the eve of his final battle, a vision of a rich and powerful king seated on top of a wheel. All of a sudden the goddess Fortuna turns the wheel and the king gets crushed at the bottom. Sobered, Arthur realizes that no matter how much secular power we accrue, our fate rests always in God's hands. The Visconti cards, on the right, above, enshrines this practical sermon.
Now, we might consider this neat morale fable to be far removed from the powerful and mysterious symbols staring at us from the Waite-Smith card, on the top left, and the Oswald Wirth version on the bottom left. But Fortuna and her shining hoop have a curious history. First of all, the medieval image derives from a much earlier time, when Fortuna represented the Great Goddess, and the crushed king was a real event. Every year, at mid-winter, the priestesses sacrificed the king; by imitating the death of the year they humbled themselves to the Goddesss power, and by choosing a new king they subtly suggested to her that she might once more create spring out of winter - an event by no means automatic to people who did not believe in natural laws such as gravity. Thus, the Wheel originally symbolized both the mystery of nature and the human ability to take part in that mystery through a ritual sacrifice. Notice that the card comes directly below the Empress, the emblem of the Great Mother herself.
By the Middle Ages the Wheel had lost its original meaning; this did not mean that it had lost its power to suggest the mystery of life. In Thomas Malorys version of the King Arthur story we find the suggestion that the Wheel symbolizes the random turnings of luck. Why do some people get rich and others poor? Why should a powerful king fall, and a formerly weak one rise to power? Who, or what, controls the turning wheel of life? Malory suggests that luck, seemingly meaningless ups and downs, is in reality fate; that is, the destiny God has chosen for each individual, based on reasons only God can understand. Because we cannot understand those reasons we say that the events of peoples lives arise out of luck, but it all belongs to Gods plan.
With the Wheel, therefore, we come to the great question of how and why anything happens at all in the universe. What makes the sun shine? Burning elements, yes, but what makes them burn? How did atomic energy come into existence? Why should spring follow winter, after all? Why, and how, does gravity work? Going further, we find that fate is also an illusion, a dodge to cover up the fact that we, with our limited vision, cannot see the inner connection between all things. 'Oh well,' we say, 'it's fate', a meaningless statement because we cannot understand the meaning. Things do not just happen, they are made to happen. The power to shape events, to give life and form and purpose to the universe, belongs, Malory tells us, to the Holy Ghost, dwelling in the physical world as a presence within the Holy Grail (the Ace of Cups) in the same way that the Shekinah physically dwelt within the veiled sanctuary of the temple at Jerusalem.
We come then to the truth that both the random events of life and the so-called 'laws' of the physical universe are mysteries leading us to an awareness of the spirit force drawn down by the upraised arm of the Magician and manifested in the natural world of the Empress. A great many mystics and shamans have said that their visions showed them how all things connect, how everything fits together, because the spirit unites the entire universe. Possibly we would all see and understand this grand scheme of life, if it were not for the fact that we do not live long enough. Our short lives narrow our vision to such a miniscule portion of the world that life appears meaningless.
Now, this idea of the Wheel as the mystery of fate, with its hidden meaning, fits very well the modern Waite-Smith version of the card, especially when we consider it as halfway to the final trump. If we place the Rider pack Wheel beside the World we see immediately the link between them. In one we have a wheel filled with symbols; in the other we find a wreath of victory, and inside it a dancer who embodies the truth behind the symbols. Even more striking, we find the same four animals on each card in the corners, except that the mythological beings of card 10 have been transformed into something real and alive in the World. Thus, at the halfway point, we receive a vision of the inner meaning of life; at the end that vision has become real, embodied in our own being.
In India, the king also lost his life each year to the Goddess. When the patriarchal Aryans ended this practice the image of the turning wheel of the year became an even more powerful symbol of the new religion. The ever-turning Wheel of Life came to signify the laws of karma, leading you to reincarnate in one body after another. Now, karma is in a way simply another explanation for the mystery of fate. By the actions you take in one life, you build up a certain destiny for yourself in the next, so that if you commit a great many evil deeds you create in your immortal self a kind of psychic need for punishment. When the time comes for your next incarnation you inevitably choose a low caste or diseased body. (This simple psychological explanation of karma is perhaps based more on Buddhism than Hinduism.)
Again, our limited understanding prevents us from directly experiencing the truth behind the wheel of Fate, or karma. When Buddha attained enlightenment he remembered every moment of every one of his past lives. Indeed, the memory was the enlightenment. By gaining full knowledge he was able to perceive that all those lives were only forms created by his desires. When he ended his desires he 'got off the Wheel'. We could say that enlightenment means (or includes, at any rate) piercing through the outer events to the spirit which dwells within them, that is, finding the Holy Ghost within the Wheel of Fortune.
It is significant that King Arthur experiences the Wheel of Fortune as a vision in a dream. Because whether we see it as the halfway point of the Major Arcana, or simply one of the steps to completing the second line, the wheel is indeed a vision given to us by the unconscious. The Hermit has turned away from the outer world. As a result the unconscious shows him a vision of life as a turning wheel filled with symbols.
The Wheel of Life does not become visible until we step away from it. When we are involved in it we see only the events immediately before and behind us; the daily concerns our egos find so important. When we withdraw we see the whole pattern. Psychologically we can view this vision as an assessment a person makes of where his or her life has gone and where it is going. On a deeper level, the vision remains mysterious and symbolic. We can see what we have made of our particular lives, but fate remains a mystery.
The symbols on the Wheel all possess meaning; they help us to understand the truth within the visions. Nevertheless, we do not experience the full living force. The light of the unconscious remains veiled.
It is significant also that Malory connects the Wheel of Fortune to the Holy Grail. For the Grail symbols, which are also the symbols of the Minor Arcana, go back probably almost as far as the yearly regal sacrifice. When the candidate for initiation into the ancient European mysteries was given his 'vision' of the inner secrets of the cult it was most likely the four symbols of the cup, the sword, the lance, and the pentacle, that were shown to him with great mystic ceremony. And the basic tools of the ritual magic, laid on the Magicians table, are the same four symbols and also the suits of the Minor Arcana.
Though we do not see the four symbols directly on trump 10 we do see two of their many analogues. The four creatures on the corners of the card derive from the vision of Ezekiel 1:10. They appear also in Revelations 4:7. Originally, these four figures represented the four 'fixed' signs of Babylonian astrology: Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius and Taurus. The early Christians identified them with the four evangelists, which is why we see them holding books. Sometimes called the 'guardians of heaven', they also came to symbolize the four basic elements of ancient and medieval science. From the right-hand corner anti-clockwise they are fire, water, air, and earth, and these elements belong as well to Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles. As the fixed signs, the four beasts evoke the zodiac as a whole. A circular plane created by the Suns apparent motion through the year, the zodiac forms the Great Wheel of the visible universe.
The other connection with the four elements comes in the four letter name of God on the Wheels rim. Beginning at the upper right-hand corner, and again reading anti-clockwise, the letters are, Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh. Because this name appears in the Torah without vowels (the four letters are all consonants) it is unpronounceable; therefore Gods 'true' name remains a secret. For at least two thousand years Jews and Christians have seen this name as magical. Mystics meditate on it (Abulafias ecstatic third level of Kabbalah was reached through working with Gods name) and magicians manipulate it. For Kabbalists the four letters are the very symbol of the worlds mysteries. The process of the universes creation was held to have occurred in four stages, corresponding to the four letters. And of course, the letters also connect with the four elements, the Grail symbols, and the Minor Arcana.
The Roman letters interspersed between the Hebrew are an anagram. Read clockwise from the top, they spell 'TARO'; read anti-clockwise they form 'TORA' (remember, the High Priestess's scroll). We can also find the words 'ROTA', Latin for 'wheel', 'ORAT', Latin for 'speaks' and 'ATOR', an Egyptian goddess (also spelled 'Hathor'). Paul Foster Case, following MacGregor Mathers, founder of the Golden Dawn, has formed the sentence 'ROTA TARO ORAT TORA ATOR'. This translates as, 'The Wheel of Taro speaks the Law of Ator'. Case calls this the 'law of letters'; since Ator became best known in Egypt as a goddess of the dead, it is actually the 'law' of eternal life, concealed in the natural world. Though the body dies, the soul continues. Case also points out that the Hebrew number values of the letters of 'TARO' add up to 691, and that this, added to 26, the number value for the four-letter name of God (called 'Tetragrammaton') makes 697. Those digits add up to 22, the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet and of the trumps in the Major Arcana. And of course 22 returns us to 4.
The four symbols on the spokes are alchemical. From the top, read in a clockwise direction, they are Mercury, sulphur, water, and salt, and refer to the alchemical goal of line two, that is, transformation. Water is the symbol for dissolution, that is, dissolving the ego to release the true self that has become immersed in habits, fears, and defences. We will see just what this means when we consider Death and Temperance.
The idea of death and rebirth is also symbolized in the creatures adorning the Wheel. The snake represents Set, the Egyptian god of evil, and legendary bringer of death into the universe. It is he who kills Osiris, god of life. It is very likely that this legend, like the Wheel itself, originated in the practice in pre-history of killing the god-king, especially when we consider that Set was once a hero god, and that the snake was sacred to the Goddess who would have received the sacrifice. The snake follows the Wheel down; the jackal-headed man going up is Anubis, guide to the dead souls, and therefore giver of new life. Now, according to some legends Anubis is Set's son, and so we see that only death can bring new life, and when we fear death we are seeing only a partial truth. Psychologically, only the death of the outer self can release the life energy within.
The sphinx on top of the Wheel represents Horus, Osiris's son, and god of resurrection. Life has triumphed over death. But the sphinx, as we saw in the Chariot, also signifies the mystery of life. The Chariot controlled life with a strong ego. Now the sphinx has risen above the wheel. If we allow the unconscious to speak we will sense some great secret to life, more important than the endless round of apparently meaningless events.
Set, the snake, was also called god of darkness. Again, to see darkness as 'evil' is an illusion, and indeed, the fear of darkness, like the fear of death, belongs to the ego. The ego loves the light just as the unconscious loves the dark. In light everything is simple and straightforward; the ego can occupy itself with the sense impressions from the outer world. When darkness comes the unconscious begins to stir. That is why children see monsters at night. One reason we make the outer self so strong is so we will not face demons every time the lights go out.
Those, however, who wish to go beyond the Chariot must face those terrors. Snakes and water, darkness and dissolution are all symbols of death, that is, death of the body and death of the ego. But life exists before and after the individual personality, which, of course, is only a bubble on the surface of our selves. Life is powerful, chaotic, surging with energy. Give way to it and Horus, the god of resurrection, will bring new life out of the chaos. The Wheel turns up as well as down.
The Wirth version of the Wheel of Fortune proclaims this idea even more strongly. The Wheel rests on a boat in water. Dissolution, chaos, emerge as the essential reality underlying the physical universe. All the forms of existence, the great variety of things and events, are simply momentary creations out of that powerful energy that fills the cosmos. In Hindu myth Shiva periodically destroys the entire universe, when the outer forms, like the ego, have grown weary and dull, by releasing the basic energy from which the universe originally emerged.
The number 10 suggests 0. The Fool is nothing and has no personality. But the Fool, like the number 0, is also everything, because he feels directly that energy of life, that sea surging beneath the boat. On the Rider pack Wheel of Fortune the centre of the Wheel bears no symbol. When we come to the still centre of the Wheel we find no symbol.
When we come to the still centre of existence, without ego or fear, all the outer forms vanish. We can understand this intuitively, but to really experience it we must allow ourselves to descend into that dark sea, to let the personality die, dissolve, and give way to the new life emerging out of darkness.
In divinatory readings the Wheel of Fortune signifies some change in the circumstances of a persons life. The person would likely not understand what has caused this change; there might be no direct reason that anyone can see, and in fact the person is likely not to be responsible in any normal sense of the word. A large corporation buys the company a man works for, and he becomes redundant. A love affair ends, not because the people have made any mistakes in their treatment of each other, but simply because life continues. The Wheel turns.
The important thing about change is the reaction. Do we accept the new situation and adapt to it? Do we use it as an opportunity and find some meaning and value in it? If the wheel appears the right way up it signifies adaptation. In its strongest sense it can indicate the ability to pierce through the mystery of events to find a greater understanding of life. The end of a love affair, despite its pain, can give greater self-knowledge.","### Reversed
Reversed, the card signifies a struggle against events, usually doomed because the change has happened and life will always win against the personality that tries to oppose it. If the person concerned, however, has always reacted passively to whatever life has done to him or her, then the wheel reversed can signify a more important change than simply a new set of circumstances. It can open the way to a new awareness of responsibility for your own life.",Wheel of Fortune,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,2834,16010
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_5_justice,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_5,"## JUSTICE
The image of this trump derives from the Greek Titaness Themis, who appears, with her blindfold and scales, on courthouse frescoes throughout the Western world. The legal Justitia, to give her her Latin name, was blindfolded to demonstrate that the law does not discriminate and applies to weak and powerful alike. The principle of *social* justice, however, properly belongs to the Emperor, directly above Justice. Card 11 indicates that the psychic laws of Justice, by which we advance according to our ability to understand the past, depends on seeing the truth about ourselves and about life. The Tarot Justitia, therefore, wears no blindfold.
So far, we have spoken of the second line as a process of withdrawal from outer concerns to awaken the inner vision of ourselves and of life. But a vision of the underlying nature of things is meaningless if it does not produce an active response. We must always act (the Magician principle) on the wisdom received from the inner self (the High Priestess principle). Not just the perfectly balanced scales but all the images on the card point to an equilibrium between understanding and action. The figure, a woman, appears androgynous; though she sits firmly on her stone bench she looks poised to stand; one foot points outward from her robe, the other remains hidden. The sword, an emblem of action, points straight upward, indicating both resolve and the idea that wisdom is like a sword piercing through the illusion of events to find the inner meaning. Two-edged, the sword signifies choice. Life requires us to make decisions; at the same time each decision, once made, cannot be revoked. It becomes part of us. We are formed by the actions we have taken in the past; we form our future selves by the actions we take now.
The scales also represent the perfect balance of past and future. Past and future balanced, not in time, but in the clear sight of Justice staring out at you from the exact centre of the Major Arcana.
Throughout the first half of the Major Arcana, when a person involves himself in the outer world, he suffers from the illusion that he is living life on the active principle. This is because we confuse doing things with action. As we turn inwards we assume we turn away from action; and indeed the process of line two cannot be accomplished without a pause in our outer lives, or at least a shift in attention. But real action, as opposed to pointless movement, always brings meaning and value to our lives; such action comes out of understanding. Otherwise, we remain truly passive, machines being pushed from one event to the next with no understanding of what causes us to do the things we do. The true purpose of line two is not to abandon the active principle but to awaken it.
The imagery of trump 11 combines the Magician and the High Priestess more completely than ever before. First of all, the digits of number 11 add up to 2, but the number also signifies a higher version of 1 (as well as a lesser version of 21). The woman seated before two pillars with a veil between them suggests the High Priestess, but her red robe, and her posture, one arm up, one arm down, implies the Magician. True action arises from self-knowledge; wisdom arises out of action. In life, as in the picture, the Magician and the High Priestess are inextricably combined, like a male and female snake twined around each other (symbol of the kundalini as well as the caduceus of Hermes), or the double helix of DNA. The colour of the veil is purple, emblem of inner wisdom; background, crown, hair, and scales are all yellow, signifying mental force. Wisdom does not arise spontaneously. We must think about our lives if we wish to understand them. But all our thinking goes nowhere unless it develops out of a clear vision of the truth.
On the microcosmic level of personal psychology the Wheel of Fortune represented a vision of a persons life; the events, who you are, what youve made of yourself. Justice indicates an understanding of that vision. The way to understanding lies in responsibility. As long as we believe that our past lives just happen, that we do not bring our own selves into existence through everything we do, then the past remains a mystery, and the future an endlessly turning wheel, empty of meaning. But when we accept that every event in our lives has helped to form our characters, and that in the future we will continue to create ourselves through our actions, then the sword of wisdom cuts through the mystery.
Further, by accepting responsibility for ourselves we paradoxically free ourselves from the past. Like Buddha remembering all his lives, we can only get loose from the past by becoming conscious of it. Otherwise we constantly repeat past behaviour. This is why Justice belongs in the centre of our lives. The ego may be only a persona, a kind of mask, but that mask can control us as long as we will not admit having forged it ourselves.
The idea of responsibility for our own life does not imply any sort of invisible control over the outer world. It does not mean, for instance, that if an earthquake destroys your house you have somehow willed this to happen, for whatever hidden reasons of your own. Understanding includes accepting the limitations of your physical existence. The universe is vast and strange, and no individual can control what happens in it.
Nor does responsibility imply anything moral. It simply means that, like it or not, whatever you do, whatever you experience, contributes to the development of your personality. Life demands that you respond to every event. Not a moral requirement, just a fact of existence.
And yet all our instincts, psychology, and religion, as well as the testimony of mystics, tells us that life contains something more, an inner core independent of that outer self thrown from one experience to another. The second line shows the outer personality dying and the inner core, the angel of Temperance, being allowed to emerge. Before such a release can happen we must accept the 'justice' of our lives; what we are we have made ourselves.
Our age sees this process of awareness as primarily psychological, best exemplified in the difficult process of psychoanalysis. Other ages have externalized the process of transformation in the dramatic rituals of initiation. There are two kinds of initiations. In many tribal societies all members were taken to special ceremonies at the onset of puberty. In pre-Christian Greece and Rome, people chose to submit themselves for initiation into the 'Mysteries' of particular gods or goddesses. These mystery initiations followed a special pattern. Having gathered his or her courage to become a neophyte the candidate first receives instruction in the teaching of the cult or mystery; during this time steps are taken, through meditation, ritual and drugs, to open the channels to the unconscious and make the person receptive. These first stages are symbolized in Strength and the Hermit. Then, in a great atmosphere of mystery and drama, the candidate is shown a vision of the cult's secret mysteries. (They are kept secret partly to protect them from unbelievers, but even more to make them effective when revealed.) In the Grail cults this vision was a dramatic procession of the Grail and its attendant symbols, carried by women weeping for a wounded king. We see an analogue of this vision in the Wheel of Fortune.
And now comes the crucial moment. The candidate must make a response. If he or she simply stands there passively waiting for the next events, then the initiation cannot continue. In the Grail cults the necessary response was most likely a question, either 'What is the meaning of these things?' or more subtly, 'Whom does the Grail serve?' By asking this question the candidate gives the cult a chance to answer, that is, to continue the initiation through the ritual death and rebirth. More important, he or she shows a recognition of being part of the process, responsible for its proper outcome. This is more difficult than it sounds. The ritual symbolizes the life, death, and rebirth of nature, as well as the body dying to release the eternal soul. To speak at such an awesome event (and remember that the initiate believed in his or her gods and goddesses in a way impossible for most of us today) required a courage at least as great as that needed to accept the truths revealed through psychological analysis and awakening.
In our time the emphasis on individualism leads us to think only of personal death and rebirth. The great initiations, on the other hand, served not only to transform the particular person, but also linked him or her to the wider mysteries of the universe. Following this lead we can see another reason why Justice belongs in the centre of the Major Arcana. We have spoken of the world as a great interplay of opposites, a constantly turning wheel of light and dark, life and death. We have also said that at the centre of the wheel is the stationary point around which the opposites endlessly revolve. The balanced scales of Justice again suggest that stationary point. When we find the centre of our lives everything comes into balance. When all the opposites, including past and future, come into balance we are able to be free within ourselves.
Many people wonder what the Tarot, or the I Ching, or astrology tell us about free will. If the cards can predict what we will do, does that mean free will does not really exist? The question arises from a misunderstanding of free will itself; we think of it as something simple and independent of the past. At any moment, we think, we are free to do whatever we want. But our supposedly free choices are governed by our past actions. If we do not understand ourselves, how can we expect to make a free choice? Only by seeing and accepting the past can we free ourselves from it.
A person may ask the cards about some situation. The cards very directly outline the consequences of some decision, say, whether or not to go ahead with a love affair, or to start some new project. Let us say that the cards indicate disaster, and that the person really can see the likelihood of what the cards predict. Now the person might say, Well, this is likely, but my free will allows me to change the situation. So he or she goes ahead and the situation turns out exactly as the cards predicted. The person has not really used free will at all; rather the idea of free will has served as an excuse for ignoring what he or she recognized as a valid projection. This is not a hypothetical situation; it happens again and again with Tarot readings. It is not enough just to foresee a likely outcome for us to change or prevent that event. We must understand why it is coming, and we must work on the causes within ourselves for the things we do and the ways we react. Free will certainly exists. We just do not know how to use it. The most important thing we can learn from Tarot readings is just how little we exercise our freedom.
In Tarot readings one should always pay very careful attention to the card of Justice. Its appearance indicates first of all that events have worked out in the way they were meant to work out; that is, what is happening to you comes from situations and decisions in the past. You have what you deserve. Secondly it indicates a need and a possibility for seeing the truth of this outcome. The card signifies absolute honesty. At the same time it shows the possibility that your actions in the future can be changed by a lesson learned in the present situation.
We cannot become honest with ourselves without extending that honesty to our dealings with other people. In this sense the card carries the obvious meanings of Justice; honesty, fairness, correct actions, and of course, in legal and other matters, a just decision-though not necessarily the decision a person might prefer.","### Reversed
Reversed, the card indicates dishonesty with yourself and others. It shows an unwillingness to see the meaning of events and shows especially that you are missing some opportunity for a greater understanding of yourself and your life. On the outer level it indicates dishonesty and unfair actions or decisions. Sometimes it is others who are unfair to us. The reversed meaning can refer also to unjust legal decisions or to bad treatment from someone.

On the other hand we must not allow the suggestion of unfairness to act as an excuse for denying our own responsibility for what happens to us. Justice reversed sometimes reflects the attitude, ‘It is unfair. Look how everybody treats me’. And on and on. Whether the right way up or reversed the clear eyes of Justice send us an overwhelming message. In the words of Emerson, ‘Nothing can save you but yourself’.",Justice,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,2071,11911
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_5_the_hanged_man,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_5,"## THE HANGED MAN
After the crisis of seeing what you have made of your life comes the peace of acceptance; after Justice, the Hanged Man. Artists, writers, and psychologists have all felt drawn to this card, with its hints of great truths in a simple design. We have already referred to the occult tradition behind the upside down posture and crossed legs. In discussing Strength we said that occultists seek to release the energy of the desires and transform it into spiritual energy. Many occultists, following the ideas of traditional yoga, have believed that one very direct way to do this is literally to stand on your head, so that gravity will pull down the energy from the genitals to the brain. Of course, only most naïve and optimistic occultist would have expected such a thing to literally happen. They may have believed that trace elements found in genital fluid will seep down and affect the brain; more to the point, the reversal of physical posture serves as a very direct symbol of the reversal of attitude and experience that comes through spiritual awakening. Where everyone else is frenzied, you will know peace. Where other people believe themselves to be free, but are actually pushed from one things to another by forces they do not understand, you will achieve true freedom by understanding and embracing those forces.
The Hanged Man hangs on a tree shaped like the letter T. Now, this is the bottom half of an ankh, Egyptian symbol of life and is sometimes called a Tau cross. According to Case the ankh in Egypt stood for the Hebrew letter Tau, which is the letter belonging to the World. Thus, the Hanged Man lies halfway to the World. We see this as well in the fact that 12 is 21 backwards, and if you turn the Hanged Man upside down (making the man himself right side up) you will have almost the same figure as the World Dancer. When we ask, therefore, what card serves as the halfway point for the Major Arcana, the answer is not one but three - the Wheel, Justice, and the Hanged Man, symbolizing a process rather than a moment.
Notice that while the Dancer extends her arms with their magic wands the Hanged Man keeps his arms crossed behind his back. Remember also that he is upside down. At this stage a deep spiritual awareness can only be maintained by withdrawing from society. In the World we see that same awareness maintained amidst all the outer activities of life.
He hangs on an ankh, which makes his tree the Tree of Life. Recalling Odin sacrificing himself of Yggdrasil we can also call the gallows the World Tree. This tree begins in the underworld (the unconscious) and reaches up through the physical world (the conscious) to heaven (the super-conscious). The ideas first represented by the diagram of the Lovers have begun to actually happen. What we saw previously as concepts now becomes, after Justice, a genuine experience. The Hanged Mans number, 12, is 2 times 6, that is, the High Priestess raising the Lovers to a higher level.
Beyond all its symbolism the Hanged Man affects us because it shows a direct image of peace and understanding. The calm shows so strongly in the card because the Hanged Man has surrendered to the rhythms of life. In the old initiations surrender involved joining the rituals instead of just watching them. For many modern people it involves releasing the emotions they have locked up for years. Notice that both these things are acts; surrender to the World Tree is an actual step we take, not a passive waiting.
T. S. Eliots poem The Wasteland links the idea of an individual surrender to emotions with both the barrenness of European life after World War I and the ancient Grail mysteries. The wounded Fisher King can be healed by a 'moment's surrender which an age of prudence can never retract'. Earlier in the poem the hero is told 'Fear death by drowning'. The ego sees surrender as death - dissolution in the sea of life. The person who gives this warning is a Tarot reader. Eliot's poem helped to popularize Tarot cards in the 1920s. Specifically, it made famous the Hanged Man. Actually, the Hanged Man does not appear in the poem but is important because of his absence.
Eliot claimed to know nothing of the Tarot, but only to use some images from it. If so, he understood intuitively that the Hanged Man bears a connection to water. Most Tarot Kabbalists assign the letter Mem to trump 12. Mem stood for 'seas' and thus the element of Water. Madame Sosostris warns her ego-blind client, 'Fear death by drowning.' She tells him 'I do not find the Hanged Man' but then she points to another card (not a standard title), 'The Drowned Phoenician Sailor', and says 'This is your card.'
The crossed legs represent the number 4 upside down. 4 symbolizes the earth with its four directions. By reversing his own sense of values the Hanged Man has turned the world on its head. The arms and head together form a downward pointing water triangle. The way to the super-conscious is through the unconscious. The Golden Dawn card on the right of the Rider version shows the Hanged Man suspended over water.
We therefore see 4, the world, consciousness, and 3, here representing water, or the unconscious, in the Hanged Man's body. These numbers multiplied form 12. In multiplication the original numbers become dissolved and form something greater than their sum.
The number 12, like 21, suggests both 1 and 2. The card reflects the Magician in the sense that the power drawn down by the wand has now entered the Hanged Man; we see it as the circle of light about his head. The experience of really feeling the spirit force within life is one of great power and excitement in the midst of complete calm. The number 2 suggests the High Priestess; so does the image of water. Both cards indicate a withdrawal, but where trump 2 indicated the archetype of receptivity, trump 12 shows an experience of it.
1 plus 2 equals 3. The Empress directly felt life through emotional involvement, the Hanged Man feels it through inner awareness.
In readings the Hanged Man bears the message of independence. Like the Fool, which signified doing what you sensed was best, even if other people thought it foolish, the Hanged Man indicates being who you are, even if others think you have everything backwards. It symbolizes the feeling of being deeply connected to life and can mean a peace that comes after some difficult trial.
The trump reversed indicates an inability to get free of social pressure. Rather than listen to our inner selves we do what others expect or demand of us. Our awareness of life always remains second-hand, never a direct experience but only a series of stereotypes, like the person who models his or her behaviour on the orders of parents and the actions of movie stars.","### Reversed
The card reversed also means fighting your inner self in some way. It can mean the person who tries to deny some basic part of himself or simply the person who cannot accept reality and who in some way or other is constantly battling life. By putting his or her ego against the world this person too never fully experiences life. None of us can know the full meaning of being alive until, like Odin, we hang ourselves on the World Tree, its roots deep beyond knowledge in the sea of experience, its branches lost among the endless stars.",The Hanged Man,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1186,6769
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_5_death,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_5,"## DEATH
As much as the Lovers (directly above Death) Arthur Waites design for trump 13 departs from standard Tarot imagery. The picture on the right, opposite, comes from the esoteric Golden Dawn Tarot, but, even so, illustrates the older, essentially social message of Death. Death strikes everyone, kings and commoners alike. This basic democracy of death was a favourite theme of medieval sermons. As an idea it goes back at least as far as the Jewish practice of burying everyone in the same style, a white shroud and a plain pine box, so that in death rich become level with the poor.
As we might guess, the great power of death leads us beyond democracy to both philosophical and psychological meanings. Death, like life, is eternal and always present. Individual forms are always dying while others come into existence. Without death to clear away the old, nothing new could find a place in the world. Many science fiction novels have shown the tyrannical society that would result if the worlds leaders did not die. The liberation of Spain after the death of Franco aptly demonstrated deaths importance.
When we die our flesh decays, leaving only the skeleton. That too will eventually pass but it lasts long enough to at least hint at eternity. Therefore, the skeleton in the Golden Dawn card implies that eternity triumphs over the transitory. Now, the skeleton has an occult meaning as well. All over the world the training for shamans includes methods of seeing ones own skeleton, using drugs, meditation, even scraping the skin off the face. By freeing the bone from the flesh shamans connect themselves to eternity.
Because people fear death they seek reason and value in it. The Christian religion teaches us that death liberates our souls from the sinful flesh so that we may join God in a greater life to come. Carl Jung has written of the value of believing in an afterlife. Without it, death may seem too monstrous to accept.
Other people have pointed out that death joins us to nature. The consciousness that isolates us from the world will be obliterated; though the body will decay, that only means that it is feeding other creatures. Each death brings new life. Many people find the notion of themselves being eaten horrible to contemplate. The modern practice of embalming and painting corpses so that they look alive, and then of burying them in sealed metal caskets derives from the desire to maintain the bodys separateness from nature even in death.
The fact is, since we will not know what happens to our bodies once the spirit has left them, what we really fear is the destruction of the personality. It is the ego that sees itself as separate from life; because it is only a mask the ego does not wish to die. It wishes to make itself superior to the universe.
If we can accept death we will be able to live more fully. The ego never wants to release energy; it tries to hoard it against the fear of death. As a result new energy cannot get in. We see this very graphically in peoples breathing when they panic. They try to gulp air in without letting any out and as a result become short of breath.
In sex too the ego hoards energy. It fights climax and surrender because at that moment the ego partly dissolves. In Elizabethan England sexual intercourse was often called dying. And Death in the Tarot comes below the Lovers.
Because the ego resists the very idea of death and therefore keeps us from enjoying life we must sometimes take extreme steps to get past it. The initiation rites always led up to a simulated death and rebirth. The initiate is led to believe that he or she is actually about to die. Everything is done to make this death as real as possible so that the ego will be tricked and in fact experience that dreaded dissolution. Then, when the initiate is reborn he or she experiences a new maturity and a new freedom of energy. In recent years many people have experienced something very like these rites through using psychedelic drugs. They believe they are dying and they feel themselves reborn. However, without the preparation symbolized in the Hanged Man the experience can often be deeply disturbing.
Contrary to what many people believe the card of Death does not actually refer to transformation. Rather, it shows us the precise moment at which we give up the old masks and allow the transformation to take place. Perhaps we can understand this better if we consider the Tarots parallel in psychotherapy. By force of will (Strength) the person, with the help of the therapist-guide (the Hermit), allows knowledge to emerge of who he or she really is, and what habits or fears he or she wishes to shed (Wheel and Justice). This knowledge brings calm and a desire to change (the Hanged Man). But then a fear sets in. 'If I give up my behaviour', the person thinks, 'maybe there will be nothing left. I will die.' We live under the ego's control for so many years we come to believe that nothing else exists. The mask is all we know. Often people will stay stuck in therapy for years because they fear release. The nothingness of the Fool terrifies them. The fact is, they are right. The 'I' created out of these lifelong behaviours will indeed die. That person will cease to exist. But something else will emerge.
The Waite image for trump 13 increases the psychological meaning of the card. The four people demonstrate different approaches to change. The king, struck down, shows the rigid ego. If life comes at us with enough power the ego may collapse; insanity can result from an inability to adjust to extreme change. The priest stands and faces Death directly; he can do so because his stiff robes and hat protect him and support him. We see here the value of a code of belief to help us past our fears of death. The Maiden symbolizes partial innocence. The ego is not rigid, yet still aware of itself, unwilling to surrender. Therefore she kneels but turns away. Only the child, representing complete innocence, faces Death with a simple offering of flowers.
Death wears black armour. We have already seen how blackness and darkness symbolize the source of life as well as its end. Black absorbs all colour; death absorbs all individual lives. The skeleton rides a white horse. White repels all colours and therefore symbolizes purity, but also nothingness. The white rose stands for the desires purified, for when the ego dies selfish and repressive needs die with it.
At the back of the card we see a sun rising between two pillars. The ego belongs to the outer world of duality, separating and categorizing experience. Through Death we feel the radiant power of Life, which knows only itself. The landscape before the pillars reminds us of the 'land of the Dead' described in all mythologies. We fear the death of our old selves because we do not know what to expect afterwards. One main function of those shamans who see their skeletons is to go ahead through the Land of the Dead and thus be able to guide the souls of others.
A river flows through the middle of the card. Rivers, as we saw with the Empress, indicate the unity of change and eternity. The fact that they lead to the sea reminds us of the formlessness and oneness of the universe. The boat, reminiscent of the Pharaohs' burial boats, symbolizes the true self carried through Death to a new life.
No matter the picture, all Tarot cards bear the number 13. Though most people consider 13 unlucky they do not know why. In our culture 13 refers to Judas, since he was the thirteenth man at the Last Supper, and therefore the number indicates Christs (and all people's) death. Friday the thirteenth is especially unlucky because Christ died on a Friday. But we can also describe Christ as the thirteenth man. Death leads to resurrection.
In a more symbolic sense 13 is unlucky because it takes us beyond 12. 12 is something of a 'perfect' number. It combines the archetypes of 1 and 2, it symbolizes the zodiac and therefore the universe, it can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, more digits than any other number. 13 destroys this elegance. It can be divided by nothing but 1 and itself. Again, we can go beyond the negative aspects of the symbolism. Precisely because it ruins the perfection of 12, 13 signifies a new creation; death breaks up old forms and makes way for the new.
13 is also considered unlucky because it suggests the frightening half-light of the Moon. A year contains roughly 13 lunations (the Moon goes around the Earth in 29.5 days). As well as being associated with darkness and mystery, the Moon goes through its own death and rebirth every month. Christs three days of death underground suggests a borrowing from earlier lunar figures, for the Moon disappears for three days between the final sliver of waning and the first return in the waxing crescent. Because of the link between the menstrual cycle and the Moon, worship of the Moon in the ancient world belonged primarily to women. Many people believe that the medieval witches were really an underground survival of Pagan Moon worship. This is another reason why our Christian (and patriarchal) cultures consider 13 unlucky. It signifies witchcraft, and subversive women following the Moon in secret rituals.
The number 13 adds up to 4, the Emperor. Through Death we overcome our outer 'social' selves. Since 13 is a higher form of 3 the card also recalls the Empress, and reminds us again that in nature life and death are inseparable.
In divinatory readings Death signifies a time of change. Often, it indicates a fear of change. In its most positive aspect it shows a clearing away of old habits and rigidness to allow a new life to emerge. In its most negative aspect it indicates a crippling fear of physical death. This fear goes deeper than many people realize, and often a reading with many positive indications will end badly because of Death in the position of fears.","### Reversed
The trump reversed indicates being stuck in old habits. Waite talks of, 'inertia, sleep, lethargy' in life. This sense of a sluggish, boring life masks the sometimes desperate battle of the ego to avoid change. The card always indicates that Death, with its subsequent rebirth, is not only a possibility, but also in a sense, a necessity. The moment has come to die. By drowning us in lethargy, the ego prevents awareness of this fact from coming to consciousness. Inertia, boredom and depression often conceal inner terrors.",Death,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1736,9891
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_5_temperance,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_5,"## Temperance
The Chariot symbolized the successful construction of an ego able to deal victoriously with life. As time goes by this ego becomes rigid; slowly behaviour becomes less a response to reality and more and more a string of habits. The purpose of the second line of the Major Arcana is to free us from this artificial personality, and at the same time give us a glimpse of the greater truths within the universe. Temperance, appearing below the Chariot, shows a person whose behaviour is once again connected to the real world but in a way more meaningful than ever before. For if the child relates directly to life it does so without consciousness, and as consciousness grows so does the ego. Temperance indicates the ability to combine spontaneity with knowledge.
The term 'temperance' means moderation. For most people this means self control. The Tarot Temperance, however, does not go to extremes simply because extremes are not necessary. Not an artificial inhibition according to a moral code, but exactly the opposite; a true and proper response to all situations as they arise.
The word 'temperance' derives from the Latin 'temperare' which means 'to mix' or 'to combine properly'. The person who has released his or her inner self is characterized not only by moderation but by an ability to combine the different sides of life. Many people can only deal with life by parcelling it off into sections. They create one personality for business and another for their private lives; both are false. They consider certain moments and situations to be 'serious' and others to be 'fun' and are careful never to smile at a serious subject. The people they love are often not the people whom they find sexually attractive. All these separations derive from the inability to take life as it comes, moment by moment. Temperance combines the elements of life. In reality it combines the elements of the personality, so that the person and the outer world will flow together naturally.
The trump displays the signs of combination all through the picture. When we look at the Waite-Smith image on the left we see first of all the water being poured from one cup to another; the elements of life flowing together. Notice that the lower cup is not directly below the upper, so that the picture shows a physical impossibility. To other people the Temperate persons ability to handle all lifes problems with joy appears magical.
The Rider pact Temperance presents both cups as magical. In the Wirth picture on the right the upper one is silver, indicating a flow from the Moon, that is, the unconscious, to the Sun, consciousness. The second line began with a withdrawal from the world to find the inner self; the time has now come to return to the normal activities of life.
The road especially signifies return. We have gone down into the self and now we are making our way back to involvement with the outer world, enriched. Notice that the two pillars of the earlier cards have become two mountains. Abstract ideas are becoming reality; Temperance is a card of behaviour, not concepts.
The angel stands with one foot on land, one foot in water. As the water represents the unconscious so the land symbolizes the real world of events and the other people. The Temperate personality, acting from an inner sense of life, links the two realms. The water also indicates potentiality, that is, the possibilities of life, while the land symbolizes manifestation or actuality. The Temperate person, through his or her actions, brings into reality the wonders sensed by the Hanged Man.
The BOTA Temperance (see Fig. 15b) shows water being poured on a lion, and a torch dripping flames on an eagle. Leo symbolizes fire (the Magician), while the eagle, the higher form of Scorpio, stands for water (the High Priestess). The angel is mixing the basic duality, inseparably combining the different sides of life that previously appeared hopelessly alien to each other. Now, the eagle stands for the higher Scorpio because Scorpio represents the energy of the unconscious. As the lower form, the scorpion, this energy shows itself primarily as sexuality, the animal desires of the undeveloped personality. When the energy has been transformed by channelling it through awareness it becomes the eagle of spirituality. Strength showed this energy brought out in the form of the lion; in the BOTA Temperance we see the process completed, the eagle and the lion combined.
The angel resembles the Greek goddess Iris, whose sign was the rainbow; a rainbow appears on the BOTA card and iris flowers on the Rider pack version. Rainbows appear as a sign of peace after a storm, which reminds us that Temperance shows the personality released by the fearful experience of Death. The rainbow comes from water yet shines as light across the sky, an emblem of the inner self, which once seemed dark, chaotic, fearful, brought out and joyously transformed into the promise of new life. In Jewish and Christian tradition the rainbow is a sign of renewal after the Flood. The Flood, like Shivas destruction of the universe, stands psychologically for the death of old patterns, which do not reflect the truth and joy of life and which lead people into evil-behavior destructive to themselves and to others.
As Zeuss messenger Iris travelled to the underworld to fill her golden cup with water from the River Styx. The Greeks believed that dead souls travelled across the Styx to the land of the dead. Only a descent into the underworld of the self can renew life.
Religiously the angel symbolizes the immortal soul liberated by death. If you look closely below the collar you will see Gods name worked into the fabric of the gown. In Christian tradition the soul will become joined with God after the resurrection. The triangle within the square indicates that the Spirit rises from within the material body.
Psychologically the angel indicates the energy of life which emerges after the egos Death. The triangle now shows that this energy works within the square of ordinary activities. We do not need to perform miracles to sense our connection with the immortal universe. We need only be ourselves.
Remember that the Tetragrammaton appeared on the Wheel as a mystery of fate. Here the name has become part of us. We become masters of our fate when we learn to deal with life as it comes and not according to routines of habits and defences.
The divinatory meanings, like the cards ideas, begin with moderation, balance in all things and taking the middle path. The card means right action, doing the correct thing in whatever situation arises. Very often this means doing nothing. The intemperat person always needs to be doing something, but very often a situation requires a person to simply wait. The card will sometimes appear as an antidote to cards of recklessness and hysteria.
Temperance signifies mixing disparate elements together, blending activities and feelings to produce a sense of harmony and peace. Because it means balancing and combining the different sides of life, Temperance carries a special significance for the Minor Arcana. If a reading shows a person split between, say, Wands and Cups, activity and passivity, or Cups and Pentacles, fantasy and reality, then Temperance, moderation and acting from an inner sense of life, can give a clue to bringing these things together.","### Reversed
Like the Fool reversed, Temperance upside down indicates a wildness, going to extremes. In Temperance, this is because the person lacks the inner awareness to know what is appropriate to a situation. The trump reversed can act as a warning that you have allowed your life to become fragmented and that you are sliding from one extreme to another. It can in fact indicate failure in the great task of letting old habits and fears die away into the past. On a simple level, the reversed Temperance tells us to calm down and avoid extremes; in its deepest sense, it sends us back to Strength to begin that long, sometimes painful, sometimes frightening, but always essentially joyous process of death and rebirth.",Temperance,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1240,7378
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_6_the_devil,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_6,"## THE DEVIL
Why does this grim figure of oppression appear so late in the Tarot? After achieving the balance of Temperance why fall so abruptly? The Devil bears the number 15, which reduces to 6, the Lovers, and in fact, we can say that Waite worked backwards from the Devil when he designed his radical version of the Lovers. Thus in the Rider pack the Devil, with his captured demons, appears as a perversion of trump 6. But why the 'true' card so early and the perversion so near the end?
The Devil introduces the last line. This hints that it provides some vital energy for the work of that line. Now, the line deals with archetypal forces beyond the self. Does the road to enlightenment take us through the dark world of the Devil? Remember that Dante goes through Hell before he can reach Purgatory and Paradise; and that William Blake, the occultist and poet, described the Devil as the true hero of Milton's moralist poem *Paradise Lost*.
In order to understand the esoteric value of the Devil we must first consider its more usual meanings as a force of illusion and oppression. The main illusion is materialism, a term which we usually think of as an over concern with money, but which more properly means the view that nothing exists beyond the world of the senses. The Devil perches on a block of stone similar to the Emperor's cube in the BOTA deck (See Fig. 5). But where that cube symbolized the entire universe the Devils rectangle, half a cube indicates an incomplete knowledge.
Denying any spiritual component to life the materialist pursues only personal desires - monetary, sexual and political. Since such narrowness often leads to unhappiness the Devil has come to symbolize misery. When we look at the two figures, however, we do not observe any discomfort in their faces or posture. Notice also that the chains do not really hold them; the large loops can easily come off. The Devils power rests in the illusion that nothing else exists. In a great many situations, from political oppression to the personal misery of a bad family life, people only become consciously unhappy when they realize that life holds other alternatives.
The Devils posture, one hand up, one down, recalls the Magician. Where trump 1 raises a wand to heaven, bringing down spiritual power, the Devils torch points to earth, signifying the belief that nothing exists beyond the material.
The Devils palm bears the astrological glyph for Saturn, a planet often seen as symbolizing evil or misfortune, but more properly viewed as limitations, weaknesses or restrictions. The outspread fingers plus the number 5 in 15, recall the Hierophants two fingers up, two down. Where the latter gesture signified that there was more to the universe than what you can see before you, the Devils open palm indicates again that nothing exists beyond the obvious.
The Devil wears a reversed pentacle, a symbol of black magic, on his forehead. Now, the pentacle carries a great many significances. If you stand with your feet apart and your arms out you will see that the pentacle symbolizes the human body. The right way up the head is uppermost and when we reverse the pentacle the genitals are above the head. In traditional Christian teaching the power of reason, the ability to tell right from wrong, rules the desires. Therefore, the reversed pentacle indicates letting your desires overpower your judgement. The Devils torch inflames the mans tail, and people who experience their sexual needs as both overpowering and destructive have often described it as a fire burning inside them. The card's background is black, symbolizing black magic, the inability to see the truth and depression.
Thus we see the Devils traditional meanings: illusion, materialism, misery and sexual obsession. And yet, the card carries a great force. The Devil stares out at us intensely. Practitioners of Tantra describe the kundalini as a fire in the body, beginning at the root of the spine, the tailbone, and evoked by sexual rites.
Consider again the pentacle. The sex organs over the head. The image reminds us of the Rider pack Lovers, where the woman, symbol of the unconscious and the passions, looks to the angel. We can also recall Strength, directly above the Devil, where the lion symbolizes the animal energy raised up and tamed. We have already spoken of the occult belief that sexual and spiritual energy are actually one and the same, symbolized by Scorpios double image of scorpion and eagle. Strange as it sounds this idea is not really so mysterious. It takes neither an occultist nor a Freudian to recognize the great power of sex in our lives. How much of popular culture, with its love songs, romantic movies, and sexual jokes and slang, is devoted to it? If, for the average person, the sex urge is so dominant, then it makes sense that the occultist should seek to tap this energy and raise it to such a level that eventually it becomes wholly transformed into the overwhelming experience of enlightenment.
A more subtle point - dreaming is always accompanied by the bodys sexual arousal, an erect penis or clitoris, plus other indications. Now, a dream is the unconscious manifesting itself as images. The indication is that the unconscious is sexual in nature and that dreams are a partial transformation of that energy into a wider form. In fact, the term unconscious does not really refer to the dreams and myths which reveal it to us, but rather to the great pool of energy which sustains us through life.
Our Western culture has taught us that the body and the spirit are fundamentally opposed. We assume that the monk and nun abstain from sex so as not to contaminate themselves. But we can look at celibacy in another way. By refraining from sex the celibate can turn that energy in another direction. In India, the connection between sexual and spiritual energy has always been recognized. Shivas symbol is a phallus, while the Tantra rites call for copulation as a way of charging the body with energy. The Gnostics, a major influence on European occult ideas, practised rites very similar to Tantra. And the Gnostics, like Blake after them, considered Satan the true hero of the Garden of Eden, seeking to give Adam and Eve knowledge of their true selves.
If the way to spirit leads through the desires, then why does society repress them? And if the path to liberation has been known and mapped out for centuries why keep it a secret? The answer to these questions lies in the terrible power of sexual-spiritual energy. If raised to the higher level it frees us from the limitations of duality. However, if the power is released and not transformed it can result in obsessions, sexual crimes, violence and even the destruction of the personality. It was not simply sexual politics that led the Greek patriarchs to attack the female-dominated mysteries of ecstatic rapture. Overwhelmed by the forces released within themselves, the worshippers would whip and mutilate themselves, and sometimes rage through the countryside, tearing to pieces animals, men and even children who were not safely locked indoors. It is only the person who has been trained, who has achieved a deep level of inner peace, who has, in fact, reached the understanding the Tarot calls Temperance, who can deal safely with the forces implied in the Devil.
Actually, the Devil implies a great deal more than sexual rites and violent energy. On a wider sense it symbolizes the life energy locked up in the dark hidden areas of the self, which cannot be entered by ordinary means. It is called the Devil because for those who are not prepared to receive this energy it can manifest itself as monsters, a sense of the universe as filled with evil, or the temptation to indulge in violence. We said in the second line that the child develops a strong ego so it will no longer fear the darkness. The action of the second line gave us a glimpse of the dark waters beneath the Wheel of Life. The third line requires a complete release of unconscious energy. Such a flood can only come through entering that hidden area, with all its illusions, horrors, and desires which can so easily distract the unprepared from the final goal.
Look again at the gestures of the Hierophant (See Fig. 6) and the Devil. The priests two fingers held down signify that there is more to life than what we see; at the same time the fingers imply that the path to that deeper knowledge is closed. The Devils open fingers can symbolize the narrow illusion of thinking that what you see is all that exists; or it can symbolize seeing everything. Nothing hidden away. The specific gesture made by the Devil, with a gap between the two double fingers, is the gesture made by the High Priest in Jerusalem to bring down the spirit force. It survives today in the Jewish New Year celebrations as part of the 'priestly blessing'.
Paul Douglas has called trump 15 the 'dark side of the collective unconscious'. When the so-called 'black magicians' (once a title for the Devil) conjures a demon he or she is actually bringing out a force from inside the self. If the operation goes successfully the magician masters the demon, making it his or her servant. That is, the magician uses the liberated energy rather than falling a prey to it. To do this, the magician must be purified of ego desires and of fear. In short, he or she must have achieved Temperance, otherwise the demon can 'win' the encounter. The magician becomes a slave to the illusions of the Devil.
We have gone quite deeply into a radical interpretation of the Devil. The card's divinatory meanings tend to follow the more usual interpretations. We take the more obvious meanings because in a reading the card appears out of context. The Devil can indicate a narrow materialistic view of life; it can mean any form of misery or depression, especially feeling chained or imprisoned, with the illusion that no alternatives are possible. If it appears in connection with the Lovers it shows that a relationship which began with love has turned into a trap.
The Devil signifies being the slave of your desires, rather than acting the way you think is best. It can mean a controlling obsession, particularly a sexual one, where the person feels drawn to commit acts he or she finds morally repugnant. The extreme example is the sex criminal; on a much more common level many men and women find themselves powerfully attracted to people they actively dislike. The feeling of helplessness and shame which results from giving in to these desires belongs to the Devil.
Earlier we observed the calm on the faces of the chained men and women. This indicates the acceptance of a bad situation. Eventually we come to view our unhappy conditions as normal, and may even fight against change. The Devil reversed, on the other hand, indicates an attempt to break loose from some misery or bondage, either real or psychological. The person no longer accepts his or her situation and moves towards liberation. Paradoxically it is precisely at such a time that we feel our unhappiness and the limitations of our lives most strongly. Before you can slip off the chains you must become conscious of them. Therefore, people who are undergoing some process of liberation - say, leaving home, psychotherapy or a difficult divorce - often find themselves far more unhappy than when they blindly accepted their oppressed condition. Such a period can be crucial to a persons development. If one can survive it, one will emerge happier and with a more developed personality. Sometimes we can find the period of transition unbearably painful and slip back to our chains.","### Reversed
The Devil reversed in the position of the past often means that the change has occurred, but the feelings of sadness, of anger, of depression remain, perhaps hidden from conscious view, but still an influence. We must often deal with the devils of the past, even those we have long ago overcome in practical terms. The psyche never lets anything go; it never simply forgets about anything. The way to liberation lies in using and transforming the knowledge and energy bound up in every experience.",The Devil,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1998,11642
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_6_the_tower,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_6,"## THE TOWER
Like the Devil, this trump carries a great many meanings, and the explanations given by most Tarot books indicate its surface moral lessons. The Tower is said to be the materialist conception of the universe, and the lightning the destruction that comes to a life based on purely materialist principles. Even here we find a great deal of subtlety. While it may appear that some outside force strikes down the narrow-minded person, the violence shown in the card actually derives from psychological principles. The person who lives only to satisfy the ego demands of wealth, fame, and physical pleasure, ignoring both introspection and the spiritual beauty of the universe, raises a prison around himself. We see this prison as the Tower; grey, rock-bound, with a gold crown. At the same time a pressure builds up inside the mind as the unconscious strains at its bonds. Dreams become disturbed, arguments and depression more common, and if a person represses these manifestations as well, the unconscious will often find some way to explode.
The explosion may appear as an external disaster; your friends and family turn against you, your work collapses and violence of one kind or another swirls around you. And it is true that one of the mysteries of life is the way that bad luck comes in clusters. Yet, how many of these problems result from long neglected or mishandled situations, striking us at the moment we become vulnerable? And if some problems, illness or death of people close to us, economic problems in society, even natural disasters, such as storms - or lightning bolts - appear at the same time as personal problems, such coincidence shows again that life does indeed contain more than we can see in front of us.
We should not think that the psyche, or life, brings on disaster simply to punish us. The drops of fire falling one each side of the Tower are shaped like the Hebrew letter yod, the first letter of Gods name. They symbolize not anger, but grace. The universe, and the human mind will not allow us to stay forever imprisoned in our towers of illusion and repression. If we cannot free ourselves peacefully then the forces of life will arrange an explosion.
I do not mean to imply that we in any way enjoy the painful experiences that shake us loose, or that we can see the beneficial experiences that shake us loose, or that we can see the beneficial ends from such means, or even that the process always results in freedom. Very often a series of disasters or a period of violent emotions will cripple a once strong personality. The point is only that given no other outlets the unconscious will erupt all around us, and that we can use this experience to find a better balance. Some decks call this card 'The House of the Devil'; but others call it 'The House of God', reminding us that it is spiritual force which destroys our psychic prisons.
There is a deeper meaning in the linking of God's and the Devil's houses, a meaning implied even more directly in the fact that the Hebrew for 'snake' bears the same numerical value (and is therefore seen as equivalent to) the word for 'messiah'. The Devil is God's shadow. In trump 15 we saw that the person seeking unity with life must bring out the energy normally repressed by the conscious personality. By embracing the Devil, however, we endanger that calm and balance shown in Temperance. We set the psyche on a violent course leading to the explosion of the Tower. Jung described consciousness as a dam blocking free flow of the river of the unconscious. Temperance acts as a kind of sluice, letting the waters through at a controlled rate. The Tower blows away the dam completely, releasing the locked up energy as a flood.
Why take such a dangerous course? The answer is that no other way exists to finally go beyond the barrier of consciousness, or to break free from that which separates life into opposites and which cuts us off from the pure energy contained within ourselves. The veil across the temple is the conscious personality, protecting us from life itself. As mystics, shamans, and ecstatics have testified, eternity is all around us, blinding and overwhelming. The unprepared mind cannot encompass such power, and so consciousness comes to our rescue, closing off the major part of our spiritual energy, parcelling experience into time and opposing categories.
The mystics tell us as well that revelation comes as a lightning bolt which destroys the illusions of the material world in a single blinding flash, like that seen by Paul on his way to Damascus, or that which struck Buddha under the Bo tree. No matter how long the meditation, the years of prayer or occult training, the truth comes all at once or it does not come at all. Which is not to say that the preparation was meaningless. The work shown in the first two lines of the Major Arcana serves a double purpose. Not only does it make us strong enough to withstand the lightning when it comes, it also puts us in a position to bring about the lightning. All occult practices begin with one assumption: that it is possible to call down the bolt of revelation, that a person can take definite steps to make this happen.
These steps include the teaching, the meditations, the ego death, and finally the embracing of the Devil. By releasing that energy we get past the barriers of repression and open ourselves to the lightning. For the spirit exists all the time; it is we who are blind to it. By going into the darkness of the self we open ourselves to the light.
Obviously, this is a dangerous process. The unprepared person can become trapped in the illusions of the Devil. We will see also that the release of energy carries its own dangers as the psyche tries to integrate it with the conscious awareness. The hero on the way back from the centre of the labyrinth can become lost if he has not carefully prepared himself.
The Tower comes below the High Priestess, for it shows the veil being ripped away. At the same time the lightning recalls the Magician. That energy and truth which passes through the Magician here strikes in full force. We also see trumps 1 and 2 in the two people; one in blue, the other in a red cloak. The polarity symbolized in so many of the earlier cards is here overwhelmed by the unity of existence. Count the yod drops of fire and you will find that they come to twenty-two, the number of trumps. You will find also that they are separated into ten and twelve. The Sumerians used a number system based on ten (for ten fingers) for worldly matters, but a separate system based on twelve, for the zodiac, for spiritual counting. This duality is also an illusion. Both worlds are manifestations of the same spirit fire.
The image of a destroyed tower brings to mind the tower of Babel. On a literal level that story explains why people speak so many languages, while morally it teaches us not to put our faith in human abilities (the Tower as materialism). But we can see another meaning in Babels destruction. The lightning that struck it was God speaking directly to humanity rather than indirectly through the ordinary phenomena of the physical world.
In an instant the speech of God replaces the human speech that built the tower; revelation replaces the step by step knowledge of the senses. Remember that the descent of the spirit at Pentecost scrambles human language; people 'speak in tongues' or make animal noises. And the shamans in their trances speak the languages of the beasts and birds. Human language is an aspect of culture and a limitation of consciousness. Many linguists, notably Benjamin Whorf, have demonstrated that our languages restrict our ability to perceive reality, like a filter over the universe. And truth, the mystics tell us, cannot be expressed in words.
The Tower's 16 reduces to 7, the Chariot, linked by Case and others to human speech. The speech of God of the Tower destroys in a moment all the careful constructions of culture, language and consciousness. In so doing it returns us to the chaos of the sea beneath the Wheel of Fortune and the Pool of water behind the veil of the Priestess.
In some ways the Tower is the most complex of all the trumps; its more subtle meanings are at odds with its obvious ones. Like the Devil its divinatory meanings usually derive from the obvious. It usually refers to a period of violent upheaval (either literally or psychologically), the destruction of long established situations, the break-up of relationships in anger or even violence.
Because the card carries such furious significance many people recoil at the sight of it. The reaction raises the vital question of how to regard the Tarot's more fearful images. We must learn to use all experience, the Tower as well as the Lovers. When the Tower appears it is necessary to remember that it can lead to freedom; the explosions are clearing away some situation that has built up intolerable pressure. They can lead to new beginnings.
To say that the Tower's appearance usually signifies difficult experience is not to insist that the deeper meanings will never arise. The card can mean a flash of enlightenment, particularly if such enlightenment replaces a limited view of life. Only the reader's intuition and experience, as well as the hints from the other cards, can indicate the specific meaning.","### Reversed
The Tower reversed indicates a modified version of the card's meaning when the right way up. The violence and storm are still there but milder. At the same time the reversed trump carries the extra meaning of 'imprisonment', to use Waite's term. This paradox becomes resolved when we consider that when the right way up the Tower liberates. When reserved, then, the card means that we do not allow ourselves to undergo the full experience. By keeping a tight control on our reactions we lessen the pain; we also do not relase all the repressed material. Within ourselves the painful experience continues, never hav ing gon its full course. By shielding the Tower from the lightning we becomes its prisoners.",The Tower,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1627,9345
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_6_the_star,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_6,"## THE STAR
After the storm, peace. The person who undergoes emotional upheaval finds afterward a sense of calm and emptiness. Lay the cards out for someone who has never seen them and the Star will hardly need interpretation. Everything in it speaks of wholeness, openness, and healing.
It is worth comparing the Star with Temperance, where we also see a figure pouring water and holding two cups, with one foot on land and one in water. Both cards come after a crisis, but where Temperance is controlled the Star is free. Not clothed, but naked. Not standing stiffly, but supple and relaxed. And finally, where Temperance pours the water back and forth, blending but at the same time conserving, the Star maiden pours it out freely, confident that life will continually supply her with new energy. The picture suggests all those mythical chalices that could never be emptied.
The Tower's release of energy ripped away the veil of consciousness. Here in the Star we are behind the veil. The pool of water, small though it is, represents the unconscious; that same water we saw concealed behind the pillars of the High Priestess. Now this universal life energy has been stirred up by the act of pouring the person's own life waters into it.
The water being poured onto land indicates that the energy freed by the Tower is directed outwards as well as inwards; it links the unconscious with the outer reality of the physical world. One way to describe the streams of water is as the archetypes of myth, the images through which the unconscious expresses itself. The unconscious is a whole, without shape or division, but it emerges into awareness through the separate streams of mythology. With the Star we have gone beyond myth to its source as formless energy; as light coming out of darkness. The transformation of darkness into light is the unconscious, the hidden vastness within us, changed into the ecstatic awareness of super-consciousness.
One stream of water flows back into the pool, signifying that all archetypes blend back into the formless truth. The value of the archetype lies only in its power to arouse the inner self and to connect us to the source. The maidens foot does not penetrate the water. The collective unconscious has not been entered, but only stirred up.
The bird on the right is an ibis, a symbol of the Egyptian god Thoth, who was considered the inventor of all arts, from poetry to pottery. Literally he taught the first artists their techniques, but on a more symbolic level, we can say that all creative action stems originally from the pool of unformed energy. It is one function of being a physical creature that we take this energy and use it to make poems, paintings and tapestries. All these human creations are symbolized in those several streams of water. Every act of creation objectifies spiritual energy in the thing created. At the same time no work exhausts the artists inspiration as long as he or she remains connected to the inner sources. Therefore, the one stream returns to the pool, just as each work gives its creator new inspiration.
The Star appears below the Empress and the Wheel. In the Empress we saw the natural world glorified in the passions. But the Empress was heavily clothed to indicate that she expresses her emotion through things outside herself - nature, lovers and children. In the Star we see the inner self joyfully experiencing itself. The Star maiden combines the two female archetypes, the inner sensitivity of the High Priestess brought out and expressed with the passion of the Empress.
In the Wheel of Fortune we saw a vision of the universe in mysterious symbols. Here the Tower has taken us beyond visions. In the Star we directly experience the unconscious, rather than its images.
As trump 17 the Star goes beyond 7, with the Star releasing the life force that the Chariot controlled and directed. 1 plus 7 equals 8, and we can see that the Star is Strength raised to a higher level, with the lion of desire no longer simply tamed, but transformed into light and joy.
The stars on the card are all eight pointed which is another reference to Strength. Since an eight pointed star can be formed by placing one square over another with the points alternating, the octogram is sometimes thought of as halfway between the square and the circle. The square stands for matter and the circle for spirit. Human beings are the link between the spirit and the physical world; our ability to both feel the truth, and to act, makes us vehicles through which the truth can manifest itself.
The Church used to describe humans as halfway between the animals and the angels. Usually a moral interpretation was given; people could follow their desires or their reason. But we can use this metaphor to say that human awareness and action connect the physical world to the angels.
Despite all the suggestions of manifestations the Star is not really a card of action, but of inner calm. In contrast to Temperance and the Moon, the Star shows no road leading back from the pool to the mountains of outer reality. Though the streams and the ibis imply the uses of creative energy, the experience of the Star is one of peace. For the moment, the journey can wait.
In divinatory readings the card expresses hope, a sense of healing and wholeness, especially after emotional storms. Very often the Star and the Tower suggest each other even when only one actually appears. Trump 17 indicates the unconscious activated, but in a very benign way.","### Reversed
Reversed, we close ourselves off from the card’s calm and hope, experiencing weakness, impotence, and fear. This deep insecurity can sometimes mask itself as arrogance. If the Star indicates the human as a link between the spirit and the outer world then the card reversed symbolizes the channels closed, and when the waters of life are dammed up inside, the outside can only become tired and depressed.",The Star,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,952,5506
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_6_the_moon,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_6,"## The Moon
The true task of the third line is not revelation but bringing that inner ecstasy back to consciousness. The Star contained no road back. It shows us dwelling in the glories of darkness transformed into light. To use that light we must pass through distortion and fear.
The Star experience lies beyond words or even form, though it implies forms emerging with the streams of water. In the Moon we see this process happening, as visions, myths and images. The Moon is the card of the imagination as it moulds the energy of the Star into shapes that the consciousness can comprehend.
Myths are always distorted. They can never really say what they want, they can only appeal to things deep within the self. The Star stirred up the waters; as we return to outer awareness those waters give forth their creatures. Remember that the Star and the Sun give off their own light, but the Moon reflects the hidden light of the Sun. The imagination distorts because it is reflecting inner experience to the outer mind.
As the world's mythologies demonstrate the collective unconscious contains monsters as well as heroes, fear as well as joy. This is one reason why we cover our sensitivity to life with the protective layer of ego consciousness, so we will no longer fear the dark and the distorting shadows of the Moon.
The Moon's eerie half-light has always brought out strange feelings in people and animals. One word for madness, 'lunacy', derives from 'luna', Latin for moon, and in the Middle Ages people believed that the souls of the insane had flown off to the moon. Today, too, many doctors and police have observed the prevalence of suicides and other signs of disturbed emotions during the full moon. Something about the moon excites fear and strangeness, just as the sun relaxes and consoles us. The Tarot Sun comes after the Moon; simplicity can only be appreciated after a journey through the lunar strangeness.
The dog and the wolf represent the animal self roused by the Moon, just as a full moon can set both creatures howling all night long. The Emperor, directly above trump 18, showed us learning the rules of society so well that they become automatic. With the last line we go beyond this super ego repression; in the process the id wildness comes to the surface. A werewolf howling under a full moon is a vivid metaphor of the power of the unconscious to bring out something primitive and non-human in the most respectable people.
As 18 the Moon relates to 8. Strength saw the animal nature tamed, and channelled through the Hermit. Here no such direction is given; as we come back from the Star the beast returns in all its wildness. Only when the Star energy is fully integrated in the World will the animal self be wholly transformed. Notice that in Strength the woman, the human side, controls the lion. Even in the Devil the demons appear clearly human. But there are no people on trump 18. In that half-light our sense of ourselves as human breaks down.
We sense something of the Moons wildness in the aftermath of a nightmare, when we feel strange within ourselves. The wild sensations are not the result of the nightmare; it is more the other way around. We said earlier that dreams are transformations of unconscious energy into images. A burst of energy which is too great for the dream mechanisms to peacefully assimilate can result in both a nightmare and the feeling when you wake up of the body being charged with wild energy.
Madness is also accompanied by uncontrolled sensations in the body. Very often lunacy takes the form of transformation into an animal. People will crawl on all fours, naked, howling at the moon. A sudden release of unconscious energy has disintegrated the personality. In the Tarot this very dangerous moment happens only after long preparation, with all the normal ego problems left behind. The Shaman too experiences a transformation into a beast. Shamans will leap about and speak as animals during their trances. But the shaman, like the occultist, has prepared himself with years of preparation. He is also armed with the knowledge of what to expect, handed down from the generations of shamans who have gone before. Remember that the Moons number adds up to 9, the Hermit. The teacher-guide of that card is not visible, for we must face the Moon alone, but the guidance given beforehand can help us find our way.
If the animals symbolize the savage in man, the crayfish is something very different. In one of his most vivid phrases Waite calls it that which lies deeper than the savage beast. It symbolizes the most universal fears within the collective unconscious, experienced in visions as nameless demons. The emergence of such terrors is a well-known occurrence to people who expose their lunar side through such methods as deep meditation or drugs. They are also seen as monsters encountered by shamans on their trance journeys. The arousal of these fears, often experienced as creatures emerging from water or pools of oily liquid, can produce unreasoning panic. Yet these images belong to our inner world; we cannot reach the Sun without passing them.
The crayfish half emerges from the water. Waite tells us it never comes completely onto land but always falls back again. The deepest terrors are the ones that never fully take shape. We feel something inside, but we can never see just what it is. At the same time the half emerging crayfish suggests that in the journey back to the consciousness the deep perceptions of the Star become distorted because we cannot bring it all back. For this reason too the Moon is disturbing, because the peace and wonder of the Star have become partially destroyed and lost.
And yet, despite the wildness, the fearful excitement, the cool light can calm as well. The Moon is said to increase on the side of mercy, a reference to the pillar of mercy on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Even more striking, the drops of light falling on the animals heads are, again, yods; the first letter of Gods name and symbols of grace. If, through preparation and simple courage, we accept the wild things brought out by the deepest imagination, then the Moon brings peace, the terrors subside, and the imagination leads us back, enriched, with its wonders. Waite writes, Peace, be still; and there shall come a calm upon the waters. The crayfish sinks back, the waters settle. The road remains.
The road leads through two towers, suggesting a gateway into unknown areas. The gateway is a very common symbol among mystics and shamans, seen also in many myths. Sometimes a circular pattern, like the mandala, or some physical formation, like a cave (very often compared to the vagina), the gateway allows us to leave the ordinary world to enter the strangeness of the mind.
The Tarots two towers carry another meaning, as the last complete manifestation of that duality we first saw in the pillars of the High Priestesss temple. If the revelation of the Tower is not integrated with ordinary life then a new and more acute duality may result. At the same time, the very fact of having heard the speech of God totally changes our relation to the question of opposites. Previously duality was seen as basic to life, but we now know that in fact reality combines all things; where before the veil kept us from passing between the two pillars, here we have already passed through. We are looking at the two towers of consciousness from the other side. The task is not to pierce through to the inner truth but to take back that truth.
In all this we have looked at the Moon primarily in terms of its disturbing aspects. But as we saw with Death and the number 13, the Moon also suggests the power and mystery of womens fertility. Menstruation (the word menses relates to month and moon) is miraculous, because menstruating women bleed copiously yet do not die. Further, many women find themselves more emotional, but also more psychic when menstruating. Fearing this power, men have created disturbing myths and taboos around menstruation. But power does not have to be destructive or even frightening. If respected, this lunar psychic awakening enriches life.
In divinatory readings the Moon indicates an excitement of the unconscious. We begin to experience strange emotions, dreams, fears, even hallucinations. We find ourselves more intuitive, more psychic. If the card appears the right way up then the person will allow this to happen. When accepted, the imagination enriches life. But if the card appears reversed, it shows a struggle against the experience. This struggle leads to fear and often very disturbed emotions as the person does not allow the Moons calming side to emerge.
Like the High Priestess the Moon indicates turning away from outer concerns and becoming introspective. It can indicate giving up some specific activity or simply a period of withdrawal. In many cultures women withdrew from the general society during menstruation. This allowed them to pay attention to that inner lunar state, and experience the powerful Moon stirrings in a safe environment. In Tarot readings the Moon does not have to symbolize literal menstruation or withdrawal from the world. Instead, for men as well as women, it can indicate a psychic awakening and the need to pay attention to it. However, while the High Priestess symbolizes quiet intuition, the Moon is excited, stimulating images from the unconscious.","### Reversed
Again, the Moon reversed signifies a disturbance. The person does not wish to turn away from the solar side, and may try to fight off the Moon by a great deal of activity. The Moon, however, will not be denied, and the fears can get stronger the more we fight it. The psyche, operating under its own laws for its own reasons, has turned to the Moon. If we allow ourselves to experience it the fears will turn to wonders and the gateways open to adventure.",The Moon,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1609,9417
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_6_the_sun,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_6,"## THE SUN
Like the Hanged Man above it, the Sun is both a joyful release after the test shown in the previous card and a preparation for the death and rebirth in the two cards following. Justice required action as a response to the knowledge gained about ourselves. As a result, the Hanged Man is passive. The Moon requires passive surrender, since there is no way we can control the visions rising under its influence. Therefore, the Sun shows an active, energized state. By accepting the Moons fearful images, we bring the energy outside ourselves, giving all of life a radiance.
Under the Sun, everything becomes simple, joyous, and physical. The light of the unconscious is brought into daily life. The two children in the Oswald Wirth version above, the more common image for the trump, are sometimes called the eternal self and the mortal body. Holding hands, they have joined together. The two figures with the Sun above them return us to the triangular motif first seen in the Hierophant two lines above. Here the joy and simplicity of the Sun does not mediate between the inner and outer poles of life but joins them together.
We are all children, in the way that sun religions speak of us all as holy children of our father, the sun. If you look at the bodies, in the picture, especially the female, you will see that they are adults. The successful passage from the Tower has given them a childlike simplicity.
The Tarot shows this passage in its various stages, giving the impression of the passage of time. Sometimes, however, perhaps most often, it happens all at once, the blinding revelation of the Tower, the inner radiance of the Star, and the acute fear of the Moon, all joined in a single instant of transformation. And the aftermath is joy, a sense of all life and all the world being filled with a wondrous light.
Among all people enlightenment bears the same characteristics, whatever the cultural interpretation through mythology, doctrine, psychological theory, etc. Enlightenment is an experience, not an idea. The person feels struck by a burst of light, sometimes coloured, like the yod drops in the Wirth card. Suddenly the world is seen or felt, as spiritual and eternal, rather than the day to day existence of drudgery and confusion. The person feels totally alive with a childlike joy that, in fact, most children probably never know, for the sunstruck person has gone beyond the childs fear of darkness by travelling through it.
In its journey across the world the sun sees everything, and so represents knowledge. Gods associated with the sun, like Apollo, are said to know everything that happens. The sunstruck person feels a sense of wisdom, of seeing everything with total clarity. He or she is lucid, a word which means clear and direct, but which literally means filled with light.
It is interesting that Apollo, god of light, was born from Leto, goddess of night, and that his major shrine, the oracle at Delphi, belonged originally to goddesses of darkness. Even under Apollos direction the wisdom and light of the oracle operated out of darkness. It was Apollo who forced Oedipus to discover the mystery within himself.
The spring sun brings forth life out of the dead winter ground. In many places it was believed that the sun impregnates not only the soil, but all women. When the biological means of reproduction was discovered the role of the sun was not dropped but made more subtle. People now saw the soul - the atman or true self - as sunlight contained within the embryo. Buddhist myth states that Gautama, in his mother's womb, was all light so that her belly shone like a translucent screen over a powerful lamp. Zoroaster too blazed so powerfully in his mother's womb that the neighbours ran with buckets, thinking the house had caught fire.
The Gnostics carried this idea further, believing that the Fall had broken up the godhead into the bits and pieces of existence. Most important, the light had become imprisoned (rather than simply contained) in individual bodies. In was each person's duty, through the Gnostic rites, to release the light within his body so that unity could be restored. The Kabbalist Isaac Luria preached a similar doctrine. The Tree of Life, or Adam Kadmon, the unity of existence, had been shattered because the god light was too powerful for it. Again, the light became separated and imprisoned, so that it was the responsibility of each person to aid in 'tikkun', that is, restoration of the light to unity.
These doctrines derive from the Sun experience common to all cultures. The sunstruck person sees everything, each person, each animal, all the plants and rocks, even the very air, alive, and holy, united through the light that fills all existence. And yet, the Sun is not the World. With trump 19 we perceive the universe as unified and alive. 21 embodies those feelings.
The usual drawing for the Sun shows the children within a garden, often standing in a circle. Douglas calls this the 'inner garden of the soul', a feeling of purity and holiness, a new Garden of Eden. When we liberate and transform the energy locked inside us we find that the Garden of Eden was never really lost, but has always existed within us.
The Rider pack shows its single child riding out of a garden. For Waite the Sun experience was essentially a burst of freedom. It was a breaking loose, a wonderful liberation from ordinary restricted consciousness to openness and freedom.
The grey, stone wall in the picture represents the past life, bound by a narrow perception of reality. The super-consciousness of the Sun is characterized by feeling a part of the whole world rather than an isolated individual. We can perhaps combine the two images for the trump by saying that once you realize that the Garden of Eden exists within you, you are free to leave it, taking it with you always as you create a new life.
The number 19 suggests a higher level of 9. The light contained in the Hermits lantern, the wisdom of his teachings, here bursts forth as Abulafias ecstatic third level of Kabbalah. We said of the Hermit that the old man and the bleak mountain were illusions required because the inner self could only be reached through withdrawal. Here the truth has emerged and the robed stiff Hermit is transformed into a gloriously open child. The other half of 19 is 1. The Magician force joined to the Hermit wisdom is super-consciousness. The energy of life united with its meaning and purpose.
1 plus 9 equals 10, the Wheel of Fortune whose vision was of something outside us that we tried to comprehend. Here we see life in a visionary way from inside ourselves. And in this kind of vision there are no mysteries and no symbols, only the universe, filled with light.
The Suns divinatory meanings are as simple and direct as the wondrous children in the pictures. The card signifies joy, happiness, and a great sense of the beauty of life. In its deepest sense it means looking at the world in a wholly new way, seeing all life united in joy and light. Above all it is a card of optimism, energy and wonder.","### Reversed
Reversed, the good things do not become lost but confused, as if the sun had become clouded over. Life is still giving the person a time of simple happiness, but it cannot be seen so clearly. The person is no longer lucid and must work to realize the joy which is the great gift of the Sun.",The Sun,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1233,7087
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_6_judgement,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_6,"## JUDGEMENT
Under the Sun we see all of life as filled with spiritual light. This awareness of eternal truth frees us from all illusion and fear so that now we feel, like a call from deep inside, the urge to dissolve ourselves completely into the spirit and wondrous life contained in every being.
This call comes from both inside and outside us, for one of the effects of the Sun was to break down the artificial barrier between inner experience and the outer world. We feel the call in our deepest selves as if the very cells of the body were filled with a shout of joy. At the same time, we recognize that the call comes from some force greater than any individual life.
This idea of Judgement as a call to rise to a more meaningful existence has its analogues in more ordinary situations. Sometimes in life a person can come to a crossroads (notice the cross in the banner) where a decision is required on whether to make some great change. And sometimes it can seem as if something within the person has already decided and the only choice left to the conscious self is to follow with the appropriate action. The old ways of believing and thinking, the old situations, have died without ourselves even noticing.
Most versions of the trump show only the angel and the figures rising up. The Rider pack adds a range of mountains in the background. Waite calls them the 'mountains of abstract thought'. The term implies eternal truth beyond the limited knowledge available to us through ordinary means.
One of the basic features of morality is the inability to know anything in an absolute sense. We are bound by our short lives and by the fact that all knowledge comes to our minds through the medium of the senses. In modern physics we learn that scientific investigation can never form an exact picture of reality because the observer is always a part of the universe that he or she is observing. In the same way, each persons thoughts about and perceptions of life are influenced by that persons past experience. 'Abstract thought' implies, like the Platonic ideals, a sense of the absolute.
We reach this 'abstraction' by making one last descent into the waters of nothingness in order to rise up liberated from all partial knowledge. Death, directly above, showed a dissolution. There the ego was dying and the trump emphasized the fear of letting go. Here all illusions of isolation are dissolved, and the emphasis rests not on the death but on the resurrection.
We call the card Judgement because, like Justice, it involves coming to terms with past experience as a part of going beyond it. With Justice the experience and the response were personal, based on your actions in the past. Here a force greater than yourself is leading and calling you, and the Judgement is not simply on the meaning of your own life but on the true nature of existence, and the way in which you and all beings are a part of it.
At times in this book we have referred to the Hebrew letters assigned to the different trumps. Usually we have followed the system in which the Fool is Aleph. There is another system, where the Magician receives Aleph, and in that system Judgement bears the letter Resh. Resh means 'head' and refers, like Waites mountains, to the true mind awakened by the call. Resh also suggests Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, literally 'head of the year'. Now, Rosh Hashanah is not the start of the calendar, like the secular New Year, but represents, in fact, the anniversary of creation. Similarly, Judgement indicates not a change of circumstances but a new consciousness, one directly acquainted with the truth through a merging of yourself with the forces of life.
The Wheel of Fortune, with its invisible laws of psychic cause and effect, was 10; Judgement is 20, 10 multiplied by 2. Through the workings of the last line we reveal the High Priestesss hidden wisdom so that now we understand the inner mysteries concealed in the Wheel.
The cross in the banner indicates a meeting of opposites, a joining of all the things that had been separated. It symbolizes a meeting of two kinds of time; the ordinary time we perceive with our senses and by which we live from day to day, and eternity, the spiritual perception of life. These two times are symbolized by the horizontal and vertical lines of the cross. Their meeting in the centre indicates that the higher self does not abandon its old activities but goes about them in a new way.
The card above Judgement is the Lovers and, in the Rider pack, also shows an angel. There, however, the angel was a glimpse of a greater truth experienced through the medium of love. Here the angel leans down from the cloud to call to us. In the traditional version of the Sun we saw the final example of that triangular motif begun in trumps 5 and 6. Here we see a child between the two people. The poles of life have come together to form a new reality, in the way that every child is both a combination of its parents and something completely new.
The child in front stands with his back to us. The new existence is a mystery, with no way for us to know what it will be like until we experience it. The childs hidden face also implies that we do not really know ourselves, and that we cannot until we hear and respond to the call. Virtually all mythologies contain stories of the hero separated from his parents and raised as an ordinary child, with other people, and very often the child himself, knowing nothing of his true identity. King Arthur, Moses, Theseus, and Christ all follow this pattern. We see this same idea in many science fiction stories, where the hero awakes in a strange place with no memory; his search for his true identity leads him to discover great powers within himself. Very often he finds himself in the centre of either a powerful plot or at the very workings of nature. We have all forgotten our true identities and have become separated from our 'parents'. And when we find or create our true selves, we will find ourselves at the centre of the universe. For the centre is everywhere.
Most decks show only the three people in the foreground. Waites addition of three more people, all facing us, suggests that while Judgement leads to the unknown, there is still an awareness (also symbolized as well by the mountains) of the ways in which the unknown life will develop.
The extra people imply another, very vital point. By showing a whole group rising the trump reminds us that there is no personal liberation. Each human being is part of the human race and therefore responsible for the development of the race as a whole. No one can be truly free while someone else is enslaved. Buddha was said to have come back as a boddhisatva because he understood that he could not liberate himself until he had liberated all humanity. At the same time, any single liberation liberates everybody. This is because any persons attainment of Judgement and the World alter the circumstances of everybodys life. Gautamas Buddhahood and the resurrection of Christ are seen as events that have totally changed the world. Lest we think this idea applies only to such godlike prophets as Buddha and Christ, we might recall the Talmudic saying (quoted at the end of the film *Schindlers List*) He who saves one life, it is as if he has saved the entire world.
In the divinatory readings the card of Judgement carries a special significance. Whatever else is going on around you, there is a push, a call from within, to make some important change. The change can refer to something mundane and immediate, or to an entire shift in the way a person looks at life - depending on the other cards, and the subject of the reading. The important thing is the call. In effect, the person has already changed; the old situations, the old self, have already died. It is simply a matter of recognizing it.","### Reversed
Judgement reversed can indicate that the person wishes to answer the call but does not know what to do. More often it shows someone trying to deny the call, usually from a fear of the unknown. There may, in fact, be a great many rational reasons why the person should not follow the suggested change: lack of money, lack of preparation or responsibilities. Judgement, the right way up or reversed, indicates that all the objections are excuses. When the card is upside down the excuses become dominant; the person remains standing in the grave. The word Judgement implies that the reality of life has changed. The only choice is to follow",Judgement,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1399,7860
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_6_the_world,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_6,"## THE WORLD
What can we say of an understanding, a freedom and rapture beyond words? The unconscious known consciously, the outer self unified with the forces of life, knowledge that is not knowledge at all but a constant ecstatic dance of being - they are all true and yet not true.
We have already observed a great deal about this card and its images. The number as well as the two wands unify the Magician and the High Priestess. We saw the World foreshadowed as well in the Wheel of Fortune, and reflected how the symbols of that trump are now living realities. One way or another, the Wheel has come up for virtually every card in the last line. The purpose of this line can be described as that of uniting ourselves with all those things seen in trump 10 as external vision, that is, fate, the workings of life, the elements of existence. When the unity is achieved the symbols vanish, dissolved into a dancing spirit.
We saw the World in the Hanged Man, by number and picture. Trump 12 maintained its bliss through complete inactivity. But even the World Tree is an illusion created by the minds need to grasp onto something. When we have dissolved our isolated selves into that water lying beneath the Hanged Mans glowing face we learn that true unity lies in movement.
Everything in the universe moves, the Earth around the sun, the sun within the galaxy, the galaxies in clusters, all cycling around each other. There is no centre, no place where we can say, Here it all began, here it all stops. Yet the centre exists, everywhere, for in a dance the dancer does not move around any arbitrary point in space, but rather the dance carries its own sense of unity focused around a constantly moving, constantly peaceful centre. Nothing and everything all at once.
And so we return to the Fool. Innocence and emptiness, united with wisdom. As we said at the beginning, of all the Major Arcana cards, only these two are moving. The oval wreath suggests the number 0, with all its symbolism. It implies as well the cosmic egg, the archetype of emergence; all things exist in potential and all potentials are realized. The self is everywhere in all things. The sashes at the top and bottom of the wreath are tied into infinity signs, indicating that the self is not enclosed but open to the universe.
The sashes are red, the colour of the root chakra in Kundalini symbolism. The dancer has not lost her physical being, her root in material, sexual reality. Instead, the energy is constantly flowing, transformed and renewed. The green of the wreath symbolizes the natural world raised up rather than abandoned. Green is also the colour of love and healing, radiating wholeness to everyone, even those who are not consciously aware of it. Purple (the banner) is the colour of divinity and blue (the sky) the colour of communication. When we know that divinity is not something out there, but within ourselves, then our very presence communicates this truth to those around us.
One of the Worlds analogues is Shiva, Lord of the Cosmic Dance. He too dances with the arms out, one foot down and the other raised, the head balanced and the expression calm. The right foot of both figures is planted in the physical world, while the raised left leg symbolizes the souls release. When we become most joined to life, at that moment we realize our freedom. The face is neither sad nor joyful but at peace, free in its emptiness. The arms are open to all experience.
Dancing Shiva is often depicted as an hermaphrodite, one half of the body of Shiva, the other Parvati his female side. The esoteric tradition describes the World dancer as hermaphroditic, the dual sexual organs concealed by the banner, as if to say that the unity they represent lies beyond our knowing. In discussing the Lovers we referred to the widespread belief that all people were originally hermaphrodites. The dancer expresses and unites all the different sides of being.
The same feeling that leads us to a 'memory' of primeval hermaphroditism has taken people a step further to the image of the entire universe having once been a single human being. We find this belief among the Gnostics, in Blake, in German, Indian, and other mythologies, and in great detail in the Kabbalah. There the figure bears the name 'Adam Kadmon' and is said to be the original creation emanating from the unknowable God. Rather than a physical being, Adam Kadmon, also hermaphroditic, was described as pure light. Only when the figure broke up into the separate parts of the universe did the light become 'imprisoned' in matter. It is a fascinating fact that the contemporary scientific theories of cosmogony describe the universe as originally one particle. At the moment that the particle broke up it was all pure light; only later, as the pieces became more isolated did some of that energy condense into matter, following Einstein's famous formulation, E=mc².
The myths consider the break-up of primeval Man an irreversible event. Occultists, however, believe in the possibility of restoration. By following the process outlined in the Major Arcana we become united with life and so ourselves become Adam Kadmon and Shiva-Parvati.
Adam Kadmon is linked to the Tree of Life, with its ten Sephiroth, or points of emanation. We have already seen the connection between this figure and the Tarot through the Tree's 22 paths. The World Dancer, by her posture, is an exact representation of the Tree of Life's most common form. The Tree is drawn in the following way:
Very simplified, the top triangle is super-consciousness, the middle is consciousness, the bottom the unconscious, and the final point, the root of the Tree, is the manifestation of all these principles in the physical world.
In the Dancer the top triangle is the crown of the head and the points of the shoulders, the middle triangle is the hands and the genitals, the bottom triangle is the crossed leg and right foot. At the same time it is all one body. By contemplating the dancer we learn that the unconscious, conscious and super-conscious are not separate parts or even separate stages of being, but are all one. But what about the tenth Sephira, the root of the Tree? We find it not in the body but in all the universe, the wonderful ground of being in which we move.
Descriptions, metaphors, even contemplation can only hint at the wonders embodied in trump 21. When the card comes up in divination these wonders become further reduced to the ordinary situations with which most readings concern themselves. The card means success, achievement, satisfaction. To greater or lesser degree it indicates a unification of the persons inner sense of being with his or her outer activities.","### Reversed
Reversed, the trump indicates stagnation, the movement and growth slowed down to the point of being stopped. Or so it seems. In fact, the freedom and rapture of the World exist always in potential to be released when the person feels ready to begin, once more, the dance of life.

These are the meanings of the World in divination. Its true meanings are unknowable. They are goal, a hope, an intuition. They way to that goal, the steps and music of the dance, lies in the living images of the Major Arcana.

seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_7_king_of_wands,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_7,"## KING OF WANDS
In readings, the court cards of each suit traditionally represent people who will influence the subjects life. While this is often the case, they can also symbolize the subject him or herself. Taken by themselves, that is, outside the context of specific readings, the sixteen court cards provide a greater range of human character. Either in a reading or by itself as an object of study any specific court card indicates a person having or expressing those qualities signified by that card.
A King (or a Knight or a Page) does not necessarily mean a man, nor a Queen a woman. Rather, they show qualities and attitudes traditionally symbolized by those figures. The particular social functions of a king, or a queen, or a knight, suggest certain experiences and responsibilities. The cards symbolize these as often as they stand for age or sex.
We should also avoid the idea that a card might symbolize an individual person throughout life, in the sense of saying about someone, Shes the Queen of Wands, and thinking that sums up her life. A person might go through a Queen of Swords phase one month, and move to a Knight of Cups the next. Or experience both at once, in different aspects of her life at that time.
A king is a ruler, responsible for the welfare of society. In the Rider pack all four Kings wear what Waite calls 'a cap of maintenance' underneath their crowns. Traditionally the king bears responsibility for maintaining his people. Therefore, all the Kings represent both success (for the king, after all, is supreme) and social responsibility.
The King of Wands translates these qualities into Wands terms. He indicates a strong-minded person, able to dominate others by strength of will. His power derives from a firm belief in his own rightness. He *knows* the truth; he *knows* his method is best. He considers it only natural for others to follow him.
At the same time he shows the Wands energy controlled and turned into useful projects, or long-term careers. The adventurous Wands nature can make such a person uncomfortable in this role. He leans forward on his throne, as if he would like to leap up and go to seek new experience.
He is naturally honest, seeing no reason or value in lies. He is positive and optimistic for much the same reason; the Wands energy burns so strongly in him he does not understand why anyone would express negative attitudes.
Such a strong personality can tend towards intolerance, unable to understand weakness or despair because he has not experienced these things himself. This impatient side of the King might bear the motto, 'If I can do it you can'. Once, in a reading, I saw a very nice expression of what people used to call 'the generation gap': the King of Wands and the Fool, both of them energetic, yet one the essence of responsibility, the other the pure image of instinct and freedom.
Two symbols dominate the card: the lion, emblem of Leo, and the salamander, a legendary lizard believed to inhabit fire. They represent the mundane and the spiritual, for while Leo indicates the personality traits belonging to Fire, the salamander was a favourite symbol of the alchemists. At his best the King is master of the creative Fire. His sense of social commitment has tamed it and put it to use. Notice that the salamanders on his robe are shown with their tails in their mouths. The closed circle means maturity and completion. Compare this image with the knight's shirt, where the tails and mouths do not meet.","### REVERSED

When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot commentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means.

In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered.

Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite’s formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’.",King of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,607,3495
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_7_queen_of_wands,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_7,"## QUEEN OF WANDS
The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King's social use of it. This does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.
Once again, we need not apply these qualities only to women. If, in a reading, we see the Queen as identifying a person by physical type alone, then the Queen naturally means a woman. But if we wish to apply the symbolic qualities to someone, then any court card can signify a woman or a man. And apart from readings the Queen of Wands stands for a particular appreciation of life.
In contrast with the King's eagerness and impatience, the Queen sits on her throne as if planted there. Her crown is flowering, her dress is sunshine. Alone of all the Queens she sits with her legs apart, signifying sexual energy. She shows a Fire appreciation of life, warm, passionate, very solidly in the world. Like the King, she is honest and sincere, seeing no purpose in deceit or nastiness. More sensitive than the King she allows herself to love both life and other people, seeing control or dominance as of no more value than cynicism.
A black cat guards her throne. In Christian folklore the Devil gave a black cat to a witch to guard her from attack. The meaning here is less melodramatic. Sometimes if a person loves life, the world appears to respond by protecting that person from harm and send her or him joyous experiences. We cannot understand the way in which this happens without reaching the complex and inner knowledge of the universe symbolized by the last cards of the Major Arcana. Nevertheless it can happen, and the black cat shows this response by nature to someone who approaches it with fiery joy.","### REVERSED

As with the King the upside down Queen shows the reaction of such a person to opposition and sorrow. The basic good nature and positive attitudes of the Queen, as well as her energy, make her invaluable in a crisis or disaster. We can see her as the kind of person who will take over the running of someone’s house when they have had a crisis and at the same time offer advice, consultation, emotional support, all these things coming from a natural impulse rather than any sense of duty.

At the same time this good nature demands that life respond in a positive way. Too much disaster or too much opposition from life (and the weakness of such a person can be a tendency to think of life as ‘unfair’), and a nasty streak can emerge. She can become deceitful, jealous, unfaithful, or somewhat bitter.",Queen of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,319,1818

The Knights translate the quality of each suit into movement. The energy we saw as accomplishment in the King, and awareness in the Queen, here bursts forth at an earlier stage. In the Knights we see the ways in which each element is put to use. At the same time, the Knights lack the sureness and stability of the Kings and Queens.
Because Fire itself symbolizes movement, the Knight of Wands shows this quality in the extreme. He represents eagerness, action, movement for its own sake, adventure and travel. Without some grounding influence all this excitement can dissipate itself as he tries to fly in every direction at once. Allied to a sense of purpose and aided by some Air-like influence of planning, the Knight of Wands can provide the energy and self-confidence for great achievement.
Notice that on his shirt the salamanders tails do not touch their mouths, symbolizing incomplete action, unformed plans. In contrast to the King, the Knight has only begun his adventures.","### REVERSED

Picture the young Knight. Unlike the experienced warrior he seeks battle at every opportunity, needing to prove his courage and strength, to himself and to others. And yet he is easily thrown from his horse. Untried, all that Wands and Knight eagerness carries a certain fragile quality. Opposition confuses him, even brings his great projects crashing down around him. Expecting everything to fall before him, he may find himself in basic disharmony with people or situations around him. His actions are interrupted as he finds his basic good nature at odds with people and situations. In a reading, therefore, the reversed Knight symbolizes confusion, disrupted projects, breakdown, and disharmony.",Knight of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,170,1003

The Pages represent the quality of each suit in its simplest state, enjoying itself for itself in a lighter, more youthful, way than the mature Queen. Physically, Pages refer to children. In relation to adults they indicate a moment when a person experiences some aspect of life just for itself, free of external pressures. As children, the Pages very often symbolize beginnings, study, reflection, the qualities of the young student.
Because Wands symbolize beginning, the Page of Wands especially indicates the start of projects, and in particular an announcement to the world, and to ourselves, that we are ready to begin either a project (this can refer to a relationship as well as practical plans) or a new phase of life. On a simpler level the Page can represent a messenger, message or information. In emotional situations the Pages simple eagerness implies a faithful friend or lover.","### REVERSED

Quieter than the Knight, the Page is not thrown so wildly by problems but instead becomes confused and indecisive. His eagerness to start is disrupted by complexities and outright Opposition, leaving him afraid or unable to declare himself. Because his basic qualities are simplicity and faithfulness (notice that many of the salamanders on his suit are complete, signifying not finished projects as with the King, but rather a simple wholeness in the self), when indecisive he can become unstable and weak. A person indicated by this card needs either to get away from complexity or to develop the maturity to deal with it. Continued indecision can only lead to the resolve and self-confidence degenerating further.",Page of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,151,910
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_7_ten_of_wands,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_7,"## TEN OF WANDS
Because they are so involved in movement and action the Wands invite problems. Constantly in conflict they almost attract enemies and difficulty. This comes partly from the lack of purpose and plan, but also from Wands' secret enjoyment of any contest.
The Ten shows us, on the surface, an image of a person burdened and oppressed by life, and especially by responsibility. His Wands eagerness has involved him in so many situations that now, paradoxically, that very energy is weighed down with commitments and problems. He wants to be free to travel, to seek adventure and new involvements; but instead he finds himself, like the suburban career man, caught in a net of endless responsibilities - financial, family, work that he himself has created. He did not plan this; it has grown up around him.
We see here the great Wands problem. The Fire energy acts without thinking, takes on new problems simply for the challenge. But these situations and responsibilities do not go away when the person becomes bored and wants to go on to something new. They remain and can swamp the fire that seemed to conquer them.
In emotional situations the card shows us the person who takes on himself or herself all the weight of a relationship. Whatever problems arise, conflicts and dissatisfaction, he or she tries to smooth them over. With bent back she or he struggles to keep the relationship going, while the other person(s) may not even recognize what is happening.
In both the practical and the emotional situation the person has taken the burdens on her or himself. He or she has made the situation and needs to realize that other approaches are still possible. In such situations the burdens may not be wholly real, or at least may be avoided; they may in fact serve as an excuse to avoid doing anything really constructive such as breaking away from a bad situation.","### REVERSED

Like many cards, especially when reversed, more than one meaning is possible. In a reading we can determine the best meaning (though sometimes more than one meaning will apply, as with a choice) partly through the other cards, and partly through an intuition that can only develop with practice. In study this variety of meanings demonstrates the fact that a situation can change in many ways.

Most simply the Ten of Wands reversed indicates that the burdens have increased in weight and number to the point where the person may collapse from them, physically or emotionally. At the same time it can mean that the person has thrown off the burdens (perhaps because they have become too much to bear). From here the situation branches again. Does he or she throw down the sticks because of a realization that he or she can use the energy to better purpose? Or does the person only rebel against the responsibilities without really doing anything constructive? A woman I once read for described it as a question of throwing the sticks behind or before us.

The Nines show how the suits deal with problems and the compromises they demand. Fire implies great strength, physical power, mental alertness. Emotionally, however, this predilection to fighting can trap Wands in patterns of conflicts. In the Nine we see again the image of someone who has faced a lot of opposition, from others and from life; rather than take it on himself, however, he has fought back. The act of fighting has developed his strength so that the picture shows someone muscular and keen-eyed. The Wands behind him can represent his resources in life, or else his problems looming up behind him. Either way, he is ready for the next fight.
Notice, however, his rigid posture, the stiffness and the raised shoulder. Notice also the bandage around his head, indicating a psychic wound. The battler is not a whole person. Whether by necessity or habit he has closed off awareness of life beyond conflict, and now looks only for the next fight, while his eyes see only the enemy, sometimes even after the enemy has surrendered.","### Reversed

Again, alternatives. First, the defence fails. The obstacles and problems grow too great for his strength to hold them back. The other meaning, however, is that of looking for some different approach.

We should not assume the card always advises us to give up fighting. To abandon defensiveness means taking a great risk, for what happens if the problems we have kept at bay for so long rush up at us? Context is everything and sometimes the context demands those powerful shoulders and sharp eyes. And yet, observe how much energy the person uses up simply keeping himself tense and ready for battle.

Fire implies swiftness and movement. Though this movement sometimes lacks direction we see here the image of a journey reaching an end, or things completed. When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Pentacles grounding to Wands energy.
Romantically Waite calls them the 'arrows of love'. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted.","### REVERSED

Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclusion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called 'hopes and fears'; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine. We become defensive and committed to fighting through an earlier experience of winning, staying on top. While the fight goes on we enjoy it. People under Wands' influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in.","### REVERSED

As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the contradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems.",Seven of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,127,714

As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the live-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title 'Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waites lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects.
Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.","### REVERSED

True optimism creates victory. False optimism, covering our doubts with bluster or illusion, leads to fear and weakness. The attitude shown in the card right side up cannot be faked, for when it does not work it becomes the opposite: defeatism, a sense that enemies will overwhelm us, or that life or specific people will betray us in some way. This attitude too often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, for suspicion can produce betrayal.",Six of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,166,940

Again conflict, but on a lighter level. It is in the nature of Wands to see life as battle, but in its best sense battle becomes an exciting struggle, eagerly sought after. The Fives in general show some difficulty or loss, but the element of Fire translates problems into competition, seen as a way in which people communicate with society and with each other. The young people are fighting, but not to hurt each other. Like children playing knights they bang their sticks together without really hitting anyone. They seek not to destroy but only to compete for the sheer joy of action.","### REVERSED

The exciting competition right side up implies a sense of rules and fair play, for without understood agreements struggle as a game becomes impossible. Reversed, the card indicates that the rules are being abandoned, that in fact the battle has taken on a more serious, a nastier tone. The sense of play changes to bitterness or disillusionment as people seek actually to hurt or ruin each other. The Fire attitude to life, especially when not extended by Swords awareness and wisdom, demands that life respond in a positive way and not show its crueller side. The Five reversed brings to mind again that phrase ‘the fire has gone out’.",Five of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,107,604

The number four, with its image of the square, implies stasis or solidity. The irrepressible Wands energy, however, require no protective fences as does, say, Pentacles. It will not be contained, and so we see people marching out ecstatically to the simplest of structures, trusting in the sun to burn off any clouds of trouble. The card represents a domestic environment filled with Fire optimism, eagerness, and celebration. As in the Six we see people following the dancers. Unlike that card, however, where the soldiers followed the charismatic leader, the people here are swept along by joy.
They are leaving a walled city for the open bower. In other words, their spirit and courage carry them from a defensive situation to an open one. We can contrast this image with that of the Tower, shown on the right. The two figures in that Major card are dressed very similarly (even to blue and red robes) to the two in the Four of Wands. In its less esoteric meanings the Tower shows the explosion that results when people allow a repressive or miserable situation to build up to an intolerable level. In the Four of Wands optimism and love of freedom carry the people, together, out of their walled city before it becomes a Tower-like prison.","### Reversed

Waite calls this card unchanged upside down. The joy is so powerful it cannot be blocked. We can add, however, that the reversed Four might indicate, like the Sun in the Major Arcana, that the happiness in the environment is not so obvious. As with the family in the Ten of Pentacles, the people symbolized here may need to learn to appreciate what they have. Another possibility: the happiness in the person’s environment is just as strong, but unorthodox, at least in terms of other people’s attitudes and expectations.",Four of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,219,1260

The number three, because it joins one and two in a new reality (see the Empress in the Major Arcana) indicates combinations and achievements. In each suit it shows that element in its maturity. With Wands this becomes accomplishment. The figure is shown strong, but at rest, unthreatened. The young competitors of Five have achieved success especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while himself stays behind. Conversely we also can look on the boats as returning, bringing back to daily life the results of some exploration or new experiencing. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers.
Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea. The setting sun, a symbol of contentment, lights up the river, symbol of a persons emotional life, with a warm golden light.
In the Three of Wands we see the first of the Gate cards (the suit of Wands, with its emphasis on action, contains fewer of these inner cards than any of the other suits). Metaphysically the sea has always evoked in people a sense of the vastness and mystery of the universe, while rivers symbolize the experience of the ego dissolving into that great Sea. The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the cards true meanings. That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fires greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire.","### Reversed

Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some 'exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to 'storms', that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world. Finally, it can indicate being disturbed by memories.",Three of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,410,2421

Again a card of success, even greater than the Three, for here a man stands in a castle and holds the world in his hands. Yet the card does not carry the same contentment as the Three. He is bored; his accomplishments have only served to wall him in (a situation very unpleasant to Fire), and the world he holds is a very small one. Waite compares his weariness to that of Alexander, who supposedly wept after he had conquered the known world because he then could think of nothing else to do with his life (his death shortly afterwards no doubt gave this legend an extra boost).
Waites comment suggests that the Wands love of battle and challenge can leave one with no real satisfaction in actual accomplishments when the fight has been won. Comparison with the Four (as well as the Ten) is obvious. There several people dance together, out from a walled city. Here one person stands alone, walled in by his own success","### Reversed

Here we find one of Waite’s best formulas: ‘Surprise, wonder, enchantment, trouble, and fear’. All these terms together describe someone jumping directly into new experience. When we leave behind safe situations and past success to enter the unknown, we liberate so much emotion and energy that we cannot avoid either the wonder and enchantment or the fear that goes with it.

seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_7_ace_of_wands,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_7,"## Ace OF WANDS
A gift of strength, of power, of great sexual energy, of the love of living. The leaves burst out so abundantly that they fall off to become yods, the first letter of Gods name. The yods presence in all the Aces but that of Pentacles indicates that we receive these primal experiences as a gift from life. We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of elemental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them.
At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people.","### Reversed

A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without consolidating past gains; or emotionally, through being overconfident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite.

Waite included a much lighter reading for the reversed Ace: ‘Clouded joy’. Then the Ace becomes like the Four or the Sun; the wonder and happiness exists even when we cannot, or will not, see it in front of us.",Ace of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,171,959
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_8_king_of_cups,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_8,"## King OF CUPS
Like the Kings of Wands, he represents his suit in terms of social responsibility, accomplishments and maturity. And like the Fire King, his position as maintainer of society does not fit him all that comfortably. Cups symbolize the creative imagination, and to achieve success he has had to discipline and even suppress his dreams. The fish, symbol of creativity, hangs around his neck, but as an artificial ornament. He has directed his creative powers into socially responsible achievements. Waite describes him as a man of 'business, law, divinity'. In a sense he has matured his suit; but Water demands to flow, not to be confined.
Behind his throne a live fish jumps through the waves, signifying that creative imagination remains alive even when pushed to the background. Similarly, his throne floats on the lively sea, yet he himself does not touch the water (compare the Queen, p. 188), indicating that his achievement derives ultimately from creativity, though he has shaped his life in such a way as to separate him from his own playful poet-like imagination.
In its extreme the imagery suggests someone who has dammed up his or her emotions and imagination. It also shows, more gently a person who expresses these qualities, but not as central to her or his life. Responsibility comes before self-expression.
The King does not look at his cup; rather he holds it in the same way he holds his sceptre, symbol of power. Some commentators see the King as a person of troubled emotions, even anger and violence, who habitually suppresses these feelings even from himself, always maintaining a calm exterior.
In some contexts, especially the arts, the King takes on a very different meaning. Because he is the leader of his suit, he can symbolize success, achievement, mastery, and maturity in artistic work.","### Reversed

More complex, and perhaps more troubled than the King of Wands, the King of Cups reversed slides towards dishonesty. When right side up he uses his creativity for his work; reversed, he turns his talents to vice or corruption. Swindlers also use creativity to further their careers, but we would not describe them as 'responsible'.

The card upside down can mean that the violent Air emotions emerge from their calm exterior, perhaps through the pressure of outside events. Romantically, the King of Cups reversed can suggest a dishonest yet domineering lover, more often male, sometimes female.

Finally, in relation to the arts, the King reversed can suggest that an artist’s achievement has proved to be insignificant, or that a person has not yet matured and cannot point to a significant body of work. In a reading, this final meaning would come out strongly if the card appeared in connection with certain Pentacles reversed, such as the Eight, or the Three.",King of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,305,1831
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_8_queen_of_cups,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_8,"## Queen OF CUPS
The most successful and balanced of the Cups, in some ways of all the Minor cards, the Queen is almost a mundane version of the World Dancer. Coming between the outer responsibility of the King and the passiveness of the Knight, she shows the possibility of blending imagination and action, creativity and social usefulness. Her throne, decorated with cherubic mermaids, sits on land, indicating her vital connection to the outer world and to other people, a connection more real than the Kings. At the same time the water flows over her feet and merges with her dress, signifying the unity of self with emotion and imagination. The water suggests also unconscious forces - the underlying spiritual patterns shown in the Major Arcana - nourishing conscious life. The unity of water, land, and the Queen implies that we do not feed the imagination by giving it complete freedom to wander where it will, but rather by directing it into valuable activity, an idea that most artists would endorse. This idea appears even more strongly in the Nine of Pentacles, emblem of creative discipline.
Waite describes the cup she holds as her own creation. It is the most elaborate of the Cups (whatever we may think about its style!) and symbolizes the achievement brought about through using the imagination. Notice its church-like shape. Until the modern age (and still in more archaic cultures) all art expressed and glorified spiritual experience. The Queen stares at the cup intently, showing the strong will that directs and moulds creative force without suppressing it. At the same time her look suggests that the creative person derives inspiration for future activity from her or his past achievements. Compare her fierce gaze with the dreaminess of the Knight, or the cloudy fantasies of the Seven.
Willpower alone will not unite imagination and action. Only love can give meaning to her actions, and realize her goals. These goals are not simply creative in the narrow sense of art, but in the wider sense of making something whole and alive out of the opportunities and elements given by life. They can include emotional goals, especially family, for while the King symbolizes society, the Queen symbolizes the family, for men as well as women.
What is most important is that she joins consciousness to feeling. She knows what she wants and will take the steps necessary to get it. Yet she acts always with an awareness of love.
Waite says 'loving intelligence and hence the gift of vision', terms suggesting that a vision of life as joyful can only come as a gift, but love can open us to receiving such a gift, to recognizing that it exists. With intelligence joined to love we return the gift by taking that vision and making something real and lasting from it.","### REVERSED

Reversing the Queen of Cups breaks that unity of vision and action. We see someone ambitious and powerful, yet dangerous, because she cannot be trusted. The love has become lost, and with it the commitment to values greater than her own success. If she slides further from the balance, she can become dishonourable, even depraved, as her creative force lurches out of control.",Queen of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,472,2780
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_8_knight_of_cups,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_8,"## Knight OF CUPS
As a less developed figure than the Queen or King, he has not learned to direct his imagination into the world. Therefore dreams dominate this card, with its images of a slow horse, and a knight lost in the enticements of his cup, symbol of the imagination. At the same time the creative force is less powerful here than in any of the other Cups court cards. Only a narrow river flows through a parched land. The Knight has not learned that the true imagination feeds on action rather than fantasy. By this I mean that if we do nothing with our dreams they remain vague and unrelated to the rest of our lives.
We may make another point about the Knights dreaminess. What feeds it - inner principles, as in myth or archetypal art; or self-indulgence, as in daydreams and escapist films or books? The English poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, distinguished between imagination and fancy. Both take the mind away from ordinary experience and perceptions. However, while the first derives from and leads to an awareness of underlying spiritual truth, the second produces only fantasies that may excite, but ultimately lack real meaning. They derive from the ego rather than the unconscious. Nothing emerges from his cup (compare the Page; p. 192). Nor has he shaped it into something greater than it was, as has the Queen. A Knight is a figure committed to action and involvement. Water, on the other hand, symbolizes passiveness. The contrast makes it hard for the Knight to reconcile these two qualities. By denying this basic commitment to the world, he does not allow his imagination to produce anything.
Because he is a Knight the outside world of action, of sex, may pull him even while he pursues his thoughts and fantasies. His passiveness can sometimes be at pose, almost exaggerated for the purpose of denying those temptations and desires which disturb his peace. Romantically the Knight can represent a lover who does not wish to commit him or herself, who is perhaps attractive yet passive, withdrawn, or narcissistic.
These harsh images of the Knight all deal with his conflicts. At the same time his helmet and feet are winged, his horse is spirited in its slowness. And he resembles Death, symbol of transformation. If the Knight is not pulled by responsibility or desire, if he follows a genuine vision rather than escape from outside commitments, then he can go very deeply into himself, turning the Knight energy into an exploration of his own inner world.","### REVERSED

In various ways we see the Knight reacting towards increased demands from the world beyond himself. It can mean simply that he rouses himself to action or else follows his more physical desires. Or it can mean that a passive person is being pushed towards action or commitment and does not like it. Without outwardly resisting he or she can resent those demands. The result can be a wall built up between the Knight and those people who are making him act out his responsibilities. This attitude can result in hypocrisy or manipulation, sometimes lies and tricks.",Knight of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,426,2486

Being younger in spirit, child-like, the Page does not suffer the same conflict with either responsibility or sensual desire. He indicates a state or a time in which contemplation and fantasy are very proper to a person. No outside demands disturb his or her gentle contemplation. As a result the fish of imagination looks at him from his cup. Amused, he looks back at it without the Knights need to penetrate so deeply into himself. Here, the imagination is its own justification.
The fish can also symbolize psychic talents and sensitivity. And since the Pages all have a student quality, the Page of Cups can show someone developing psychic abilities, either through an actual programme of study and/or meditation, or else such talents developing by themselves, but in a peaceful way.","### Reversed

Right side up we saw a person letting his imagination bubble up before him. Because he does nothing with his fantasies they give him no trouble. If he acts upon them, however, they may lead him into mistakes. Reversed therefore means to follow our inclinations, to act without thinking, or to allow our immediate desires to seduce us, particularly if they go against our common sense. We see the reversed Page whenever we buy something we do not need and do not even really want; we see him when we make promises we cannot keep or commitments that do not really mean anything.

In other situations, if the Page refers to psychic development, or true visions, then reversed shows a person disturbed by these visions. For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions.

As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of Gods grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a flood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain.
The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They symbolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condition of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy. It especially refers to the recognition of the valuable qualities in a situation. This meaning pertains especially in readings where the Ten of Cups appears in contrast to the Ten of Pentacles.","### REVERSED

There are two basic variants here. First, all the emotion turns against itself.

People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond superficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time.","### Reversed

For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness — to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty’.

The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has come to leave. The imagery suggests one of the true uses of Water instinct - an ability to sense when something has ended before it either dries up or comes crashing down around us, to know the time to move on.
We see the figure climbing a hill, going to higher ground, with the implication of moving from a less to a more meaningful situation. Notice the resemblance of the figure to the Hermit. To reach the height of the Hermits wisdom, we must first put the ordinary things of life behind us.
The Hermit reminds us that the image of land does not necessarily mean action or involvement in the ordinary sense, but can suggest almost the opposite: that is, withdrawing from outer activity to seek at greater self-awareness. At first the scene appears to take place at night; but when we look closer we see that actually it depicts an eclipse, with the moon moving across the sun. A moon phase, that is, at period of inner awareness, has taken over from outer-directed activity. By joining moon imagery to a scene of movement, the card teaches us that developing a deeper sense of self is also an action. Remember that the Hermit, by reversing the sexual polarity of the High Priestess above him, combines action and intuition in a definite programme of self-knowledge.
Whether we view the figure as moving away from the world, or into action, the card symbolizes leaving a stable situation. In its deepest level this card acts as at Gate, similar in certain ways to the Three of Wands. Both work through the image of a journey into the unknown, but while the Fire card is drawn to Water, the Water card is drawn to Air. The Three of Wands breaks down the ego and frees the exploring spirit, while the Eight of Cups moves from the vagueness of Water to the specific knowledge of abstract principles symbolized by the climb up the Hermit's mountain.","### Reversed

Sometimes the upside down Eight indicates the simple negation of the card's basic image — a refusal to leave some situation, a determination to hang on even when we know deep inside that we have taken all we can from it. Such a description characterizes many relationships.

Usually, however, the card reversed maintains its quality of awareness and correct response. It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning.

One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment.",Eight of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,424,2338

With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, 'fancies' without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology-a god-like face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their *content*; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves.","### REVERSED

As cards of benevolent emotion and dreams, the Cups signify sweet memories. Sometimes these memories truly represent the past; at other times we may idealize the past and see it through a haze of security and happiness. The emblem of this second attitude is childhood, pictured as a safe time, when parents, or older brothers and sisters, protected us and gave us everything we needed. Sometimes such an attitude can produce a warm secure feeling which will help people face their current problems. In this sense the card shows the past (the dwarf) giving a gift of memories to the future, symbolized by the child. At other times, however, a fixation on the past can prevent a person from facing current problems. The past can distract from the present just as much as fantasies of the future.
There are other meanings for the Six beside memory. The Sixes show relationships of giving and receiving. Here we see the image of a teacher or protector giving wisdom and security to someone who might be a family member, a student, or a friend.","### Reversed

Like the Seven, the Six reversed indicates a move towards action. Specifically, it shows looking towards the future, rather than the past. The two cards reversed are very similar; the difference is that the Six shows an attitude while the Seven indicates actual steps taken.

At other times, depending on the right side up meaning, the Six reversed indicates disturbed memories (compare the Three of Wands reversed), or a feeling of alienation from the past. It can also show the breakdown of a relationship based on one person protecting or teaching the other(s).",Six of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,185,1054

The Fives concern struggle and sometimes pain. With Wands we saw the adventure of competition; Cups show the emotional reaction to loss. The picture depicts sorrow but also acceptance. Three cups lie spilled out, but two remain standing, even if at the moment the figure concentrates on the three. In readings I have often seen this card linked to either the Three of Cups as a happiness or hope that has failed, or else the Three of Swords; the two cups standing have often referred to the Two of Cups, that is, support from a lover or friend.
The woman (or man; the androgynous character of the figure indicates that sorrow unites the sexes) stands rigid, wrapped in black, the colour of grief. She needs to accept that some happiness has suddenly vanished, been knocked over. She does not yet realize that something remains, for first she must understand and accept the loss. Has she herself knocked over the cups, either through recklessness or by taking them for granted? In the sense of awareness the card relates to Justice, emblem of truth and the acceptance of responsibility. In her pose and costume she resembles the Hermit, who cloaks himself in wisdom to hold him upright in his task of looking within for a vision of his life, the vision he will accept injustice.
The river represents the flow of sorrow but the bridge symbolizes consciousness and determination. It leads from the past (loss) to the future (new beginnings). When she has accepted her loss she can then turn, pick up the two remaining cups, and cross over the bridge to the house, symbol of stability and continuity.
With its deep evocation of regret the card forms another Gate, bringing to us that sense of spiritual loss and separation which all over the world has given rise to myths of a fall or an exile from Paradise.","### Reversed

The basic meaning of the card can change in three ways when reversed. First, it can mean not accepting the loss, and as an extension of this, false projects or mistakes. Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and permanent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruction.",Five of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,320,1820

The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the 'negative imagination' makes us look at everything as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining.
The three cups symbolize the persons past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment.","### REVERSED

Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",Four of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,124,733

The Threes show an appreciation of the meaning and value of the suit. Because of the Grail at the base of the suit, the Three of Cups indicates joy, celebration, and above all sharing the wonder of life. As if we had passed the crisis of action, the final three cards all, according to their numbers, flow with happiness. Here we see the women celebrating, as at a harvest. Either a crisis has finished, or work has produced good results.
We see the three women so intertwined we can hardly tell whose arm is whose. In bad times as well as good, the card shows a sharing of experience.","### REVERSED

Again several meanings present themselves. First of all it can show the loss of some happiness. Very often it indicates that something hoped for has not come about. It can also signify the failure of friendship, and again the disillusionment of finding that friends have not supported us when we needed them, or else the break up of a group of friends.

Another meaning shows a corruption of the original. Rather than a shared celebration of life’s joys we find what Waite quaintly calls ‘excess in physical enjoyment and the pleasures of the senses’. Obviously Waite intended this to mean that deeper values are ignored. It is worth observing however, that most people find this phrase, especially as a prediction, not at all unpleasant.",Three of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,113,602

In many ways this card acts as a lesser version of the Lovers. While the trump shows the great power of mature sexual relationships the Minor card emphasizes the beginning of a relationship. This is not a hard and fast rule as far as readings are concerned. The Two can often show a long-term union or friendship, perhaps on a lighter level than the Lovers. In study, and most commonly in practice, however, it indicates the pledging of friendship, the beginning of a love affair.
In the trump we see the Angel, symbol of super-consciousness. In the Two of Cups we see the winged lion over the caduceus of Hermes, symbol of healing and wisdom. In both cases, the card shows how two people by uniting their separate qualities and abilities through love, produce something in their lives beyond what either would have achieved alone. The lion symbolizes sexuality, the wings Spirit. Love gives a greater meaning to the sexual drive that leads us to it.
In Part One of this book we saw how the Lovers can serve as a diagram of the unified self. We can look at the Two of Cups in a similar way. While the man symbolizes action and movement, the woman symbolizes emotion, sensitivity, and an appreciation of experience. By uniting these two qualities we give our lives value.
Notice the resemblance of the man to the Fool. In a reading these two cards came up linked together. The woman, an artist, wanted to know what direction her work should take. She was especially concerned to investigate whether her art came from a real centre in her life or was simply an intellectual exercise. Now, other cards indicated she had reached a level of technical mastery in what she had been doing, while the Fool, as an outcome, showed her taking a leap into a new area. But the Two of Cups showed she would find success if she linked her technical ability and explorations to the spiritual grounding symbolized by the woman.","### REVERSED

In different ways the reversed card shows a breakdown of the ideals symbolized right side up. It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring.

If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion.",Two of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,343,1924

From the King's conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive finally at the Ace-emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. Just as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.
The Smith picture, with its dove and wafer, specifically shows the Holy Grail, said to contain the physical presence of the Holy Ghost at work in the world. In the more subtle versions of the King Arthur legend, it was not really chivalry - that is, a moral structure - that held together King Arthurs glorious kingdom, but rather the secret presence of the Holy Grail hidden in the land. When the Grail left (because Arthurs knights failed to approach it in a spiritual way) the kingdom fell apart. The allegory tells us that the world does not function primarily by its laws, its moral order and its social structures, but rather by the spiritual basis which gives all these things meaning, and protects them from corruption. When we look at existence as something solely to be conquered (the way Arthurs knights went after the Grail) we bring only chaos. Cups - Water - symbolize receptivity. Love, and ultimately life, cannot be seized, but only accepted.","### Reversed

The reversed Ace always brings disruption. Here we see unhappiness, violence, destruction — the very conditions acted out in the King Arthur legend when the Grail had left the kingdom. The reversed card can indicate simply that the times have turned against us and we can only accept that life brings problems as well as joy. Or, the card upside down can imply that we ourselves bring about our unhappiness by not recognizing what life offers us, or by reacting violently when what we need is calm.",Ace of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,223,1278
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_9_king_of_swords,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_9,"## KING OF SWORDS
As a maintainer of the social structure the King represents authority, power, and judgement. He takes the mental energy of Air and uses it to uphold and rule the world with the keenness of his mind and the force of his personality. His crown is yellow, the colour of mental energy, while his mantle is purple, for wisdom. His cap, a Burnouse-like head-dress, is red, the colour of action. The King's intellect does not exist for itself alone, but rather for what it can do, as a tool of authority. Similarly, his sword, unlike that of the Queen of Swords or of Justice, does not point straight up, for pure wisdom, but rather tilts slightly to the right, the side of action. The requirement to act upon his judgements tends to distort the power of judgement itself, a fact we can see if we compare the situation of an academic observer of politics with that of someone running a country.
Moreover, the emphasis on social-minded realism may narrow his viewpoint to a very limited materialism. We can see him in the man or woman priding him or herself on tough-minded common sense, with no time for mystic mumbo jumbo. Such people usually ignore how much of their thinking depends on preconception and prejudice, rather than observation of life.
Notice the resemblance to the Emperor. We can call the King the Emperors representative in the real world. While the trump embodies the archetype of order, law, society, the King of Swords maintains these principles in practice.
Two birds, the animal emblem of the Swords court cards, fly behind the throne. The bird symbolizes the minds ability to take us into the high air of wisdom, removed from fiery passion, watery emotion, or earthly material corruption. The number two, on the other hand, symbolizes choice, the constant tension between abstract thought and the action that must be taken in the world.
But if the birds symbolize the minds ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the Kings throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person.
In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth.","### REVERSED

Right side up the King walks a narrow line between committed intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance.

In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relationship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit). By itself, however, it symbolizes the arrogance of a powerful mind turned in on itself, recognizing only its own desire for control.",King of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,516,2978
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_9_queen_of_swords,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_9,"## QUEEN OF SWORDS
As the yin aspect of the suit, the Queen of Swords symbolizes experiences of both sorrow and wisdom, and especially the connection between them. Having experienced pain (the card sometimes signifies widowhood), and having faced it with courage, acceptance, and honesty, she has found wisdom.
The tassel hanging from her left wrist (the side of experience) resembles a cut rope (compare the Eight of Swords, p.219). She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up.
In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender.","### REVERSED

The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants.

When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow-minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her.

The young Knight, whose youth makes him both freer of social responsibility than the King, and less tempered by experience than the Queen, rides directly into the storm, waving his sword in his eagerness to overcome all difficulties. He is brave, skillful, strong; yet he tends also towards wildness, even fanaticism. He recognizes no limits.
And yet he often does not know how to sustain a long struggle. He expects his enemies and life's problems to fall under his charge and cannot so easily handle a situation that requires long, steady plodding.
His eagerness suggests a certain innocence, like a young knight who has never lost a battle. His bravery, his skill, his readiness to charge all problems, can sometimes contain a fear of losing that innocence, that strong belief in himself. For he knows inside that he has yet to face and overcome life's greater difficulties. The opposite in many ways of the Knight of Cups, he directs all his energy outwards; he is perhaps nervous of being quietly alone with himself.","### REVERSED

A much lighter card than the other court Swords, the Page represents a very different approach to problems than the Knight (notice that while the King and Queen emphasize wisdom, the two 'younger' cards deal with Swords more immediate quality of conflict). Rather than charge them he finds it sufficient to simply get above them, to find the high ground. Instead of solving conflicts or meeting opposition he detaches himself.
If the situation is one that calls for such an easygoing approach then the Pages unattached attitude is very beneficial. But if a more difficult problem is involved, then the Pages practice becomes hard to maintain. It requires vigilance to use Waites term, making sure that people or situations do not get too close. Much of the Pages energy goes to looking over his shoulder. As a somewhat aged student, Hamlet embodied the Pages attitude of observation and irony. His situation, however, called for the aggressive approach of the Knight.
Because of his detached quality the Page can sometimes indulge himself in spying on people, either literally, or figuratively, as an attitude to life. In other words, he may look on human life as a kind of curious spectacle in which he himself does not expect to take part.","### REVERSED

Here we see the effect of the Page’s aloof attitude in a situation that requires more force. The vigilance turns to paranoia; everyone appears to be an enemy. What began as a feeling of ‘I’m above all that, I don’t need to concern myself with that,’ becomes an obsession with problems and a seeming inability to do anything about them. Such feelings of weakness are endemic to Swords; they require Wands for courage and optimism.",Page of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,213,1259

From the blue skies of the court cards to the black gloom of the Ten and Nine. Just as the Ten of Cups showed joy overflowing, so the Ten of Swords fills us with pain. Despite the extreme picture the card does not represent death, or even especially violence. It signifies more of a reaction to problems than the problems themselves.
It takes only one sword to kill someone. The ten swords in the man's body, even including one in his ear, suggest hysteria, and the adolescent attitude that 'no one has ever suffered so much as me', 'my life is over', and so on. Notice that in contrast to the Nine the sky clears in the distance, the black clouds give way to sunshine, and that in contrast to the Five or the Two, the water lies placidly. The situation is not so bad as it looks.","### Reversed

Turn this card round and we can imagine the swords falling out of his back. Waite describes it as success and advantage but not permanent. These ideas suggest that when a situation changes, the problems may go away for the moment. However, the person must now take advantage of this relief by making a real change in her or his condition — either practical or mental, depending on the need — so that the situation will not revert to what it was. The card bears a relationship to the Ten of Wands reversed, where we saw the danger of picking up the sticks again once the situation has calmed down.",Ten of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,152,797

The image of deepest sorrow, of utmost mental pain. Where the Queen frees herself by turning sorrow into wisdom, and the Three suggests the calm of acceptance, the Nine shows the moment of agony, of dissolution. The Swords do not stick in her back, but hang in the black air above her. Very often the Nine refers not to something happening directly to us, but rather to someone we love.
Love, in fact, fills the card and gives it its meaning. The blanket design shows roses, symbol of passion, alternating with the signs of the zodiac. In the cards deepest sense it shows a mind that takes on itself all the sorrows of the world, the Lamed Vav, or Just Man, of Jewish legend.
Can we see a way out of such dreadful pain? Both Buddha and Christ pictured the world as a place of unending sorrow, yet both also said that tragedy remains always a half truth, that the universe seen as a whole brings joy and peace. And Nietzsche wrote of embracing existence so completely, with such total ecstatic honesty, that we would gladly repeat, endlessly, every moment of our lives, whatever the pain.","### REVERSED

For the Nine reversed Waite gives one of his most suggestive formulas: ‘Imprisonment, suspicion, doubt, reasonable fear, and shame’. The words delineate a state of mind or rather a progression of states that result when people retreat into themselves from some problem they do not dare to confront.

As with the card right side up, the reversed card deals with our reaction to something outside ourselves, but here it is oppression rather than tragedy. The key term is ‘reasonable fear’, which can refer to, say, political oppression — as of racial or sexual minorities; or social oppression — a feeling of being a scapegoat because of appearance, speech, etc.; or simply the personal oppression of a domineering family or partner. The important thing is that the problem is real, but because we cannot directly attack it, we tend to hide in ourselves, keeping in our anger and resentment.

Anger turned in on itself becomes depression and from there suspicion. The person who was laughed at as a child for her big nose thinks that everyone is looking at her. The black person believes that any complaint at work is a racial slur. And suspicion easily leads to self-doubt and shame. Often it does not even help, at least not completely, if we rationally know that we have no reason to feel ashamed, that in fact those who have ridiculed or oppressed us should feel the shame. Unless the oppressed self-doubting person takes action, expresses her or his anger, makes real changes in her or his life, the deep hidden shame will remain.",Nine of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,200,1105
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_9_eight_of_swords,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_9,"## EIGHT OF SWORDS
From the Nine reversed we move to an even clearer image of oppression. We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving.
The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confusion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call mystification - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition.
On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Because we live such lives, bounded by our physical needs, the limitations of our senses, and the conditioning of language and culture, we can know reality only through filters. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call conscious evolution, we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say This is the truth; this is the way things really are. Recognition of ignorance is the first (and often the hardest) step to true knowledge.","### REVERSED

Freedom begins when we throw off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situations), and what we can do about it now. The reversed Eight means, in general, liberation from some oppressive situation; primarily it refers to the first step of such liberation, that is seeing things as clearly as possible.",Eight of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,280,1610

The theme of struggle continues. Here we see an image of taking action against problems. Sometimes the card means simply a daring act, even a coup that takes the sting out of opposition. More often, it stands for an impulsive act when a careful plan is required.
The picture shows us someone grinning as he makes off with his enemys weapons. He has not attacked the camp, he cannot even carry all the swords. The card implies schemes and actions that do not solve anything. Not as obvious, but sometimes more important, is the sense of isolation involved. He is acting alone, unable or unwilling to get anyones help.
Going a step further, this card can indicate craftiness, but with the flaw of habitually hiding, often for no real reason, ones true plans or intentions.","### Reversed

The isolation turns around to become communication, in particular seeking advice on what to do about one’s problems. Valuable as the specific instructions can be, just as important is the person’s readiness to listen and to seek help. The card can sometimes refer to the *act* of finding help, such as consulting a reader or a therapist or simply friends.

Like all else the value of the image depends on context. Where self-reliance is required the Seven of Swords reversed can imply an overdependence on others telling us what to do. When the card reversed appears in opposition to the Fool or the Hanged Man, we must look to the other cards to determine which course – independence or seeking advice – will produce the best results.",Seven of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,139,789

A strange and powerful image, this card more than any other illustrates how Pamela Smiths images reach beyond Arthur Waites formulas. *The Pictorial Key* says journey by water, route, way, expedient. But the picture of a ferryboat at twilight, carrying shrouded figures to a wooded isle, suggests a more spiritual journey - in myth, Charon carrying the dead across the River Styx. A great silence fills this card, like the silence of Salvador Dalis paintings.
Usually this card does not signify death, though it can indicate mourning; nor does it show transformation, in the sense of Death in the Major Arcana. Rather it depicts a quiet passage through a difficult time. Waite says, The freight is light; and Eden Gray writes, The swords do not weigh down the boat. Though we carry our troubles with us we have adapted to them; they will not sink us or bear us down. On a simple level it means functioning in some difficult situation without attacking the problems. It can refer to an immediate problem or a situation that has gone on for years. Looking deeper we see the image of a long sorrow - mourning is an example, but not the only one - which a person has felt for so long that it no longer gives pain, but has become part of life.
There is another, less disturbing meaning - that of a quiet passage, physically (certainly the literal meaning of a journey must not be forgotten) or spiritually, a time of easy transition. Notice the ferrymans black pole. Black indicates potentiality; where nothing final has happened, all things remain possible. By staying calm we waste neither energy nor opportunity.
The Six of Swords is a Gate. Looking at it with sensitivity and then entering the picture will produce first a quieting effect on the mind and then later, slowly, a sense of movement within the self.","### Reversed

Seen in one way the balance and peace become disturbed; the passage is no longer serene for the water, symbol of emotion, becomes stirred up. So the reversed card can suggest a stormy journey, physically or spiritually. It can refer also to the idea that when we try to attack some longstanding problem, especially one accepted by everyone else, we agitate the situation. As one example, an unsatisfying or oppressive relationship can go quietly along for years until one of the members decides to do something about it. To try to remove the swords from the boat can sink it, for the swords, after all, are plugging up the holes.

In another way, the Six reversed can show communication, reminding us that right side up the people maintain their composure by not speaking or looking at each other. If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing.",Six of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,320,1827

One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives.
All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humiliation as well as weakness goes with their defeat.
The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case.","### Reversed

The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those symbolized by Wands, may help.

Swords are more pessimistic than any cards in the Major Arcana. Taken alone, no Minor suit can show the true balance of life. They break experience into parts and therefore distort and exaggerate. An excess of Swords cards needs more than any other suit to be balanced with experiences and attitudes from the other suits elements.",Five of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,205,1079

Fours relate to stabilization; for the unhappy Swords this translates as rest or even just retreat. The image shows not death but withdrawal. People sometimes respond to difficulties by isolating themselves, literally hiding in their houses, or simply flattening their emotional reactions to hide inside themselves. This card once appeared in a reading for a man accustomed to dealing forcefully with everyone around him. The card showed him that when his aggressiveness failed, or when his confident mask grew too heavy for him, he hid from the world rather than show his other side or try to work with other people.
Withdrawal, however, can also lead to healing, if the purpose is not to hide but to recoup strength. The card can mean holding back from a fight until there is a better chance of winning. Similarly, by withdrawing for a time after some deep hurt a person gives him or herself a chance to recover.
Notice that the knight lies in a church, and that the window shows Christ giving a healing blessing to a supplicant. The imagery suggests the Fisher King of the Grail legend, whose physical wound mirrored the spiritual sickness of the kingdom. The picture also recalls Sleeping Beauty. Both these figures needed outsiders to awaken them. The King lay ill until Galahad brought the Grails blessing; and the princess, symbol of a neurotic fear of life, remained asleep until the prince, refusing to be stopped by the fence of thorns (the neurotic will use the force of her or his personality to set up barriers against other people), roused her through sexual life-energy (in the Disney version he kisses her; in folk tales he has intercourse with her). Withdrawal, even for the purpose of recovery, can shut a person off from the world, creating a kind of spell only outside energy can break.","### REVERSED

Reversed this card shows a return to the world. Whether this comes about quietly or dramatically depends on the situation. Sometimes the card refers to caution, as if the knight emerges carefully from his sanctuary. At other times the Four reversed can represent other people perceiving and breaking through the fence — the prince coming after Sleeping Beauty.",Four of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,312,1824
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_9_three_of_swords,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_9,"## THREE OF SWORDS
The Golden Dawn title for this card is Sorrow. Of all the Swords, the Three most simply represents pain and heartbreak. Yet, for all its gloom, the picture brings a certain calm in the symmetry of its swords. To true sorrow we can make only one response - take the pain into our hearts, accept it and go beyond it. The Nine raised the question of how to continue after a great anguish. The Three tells us that we must not push the pain away from us, but somehow take it deep inside until it becomes transformed by courage and love.
Once, in a reading for myself, after a death in my family, the Three of Swords came up crossed by the Three of Cups. At first I thought this meant setting joy and friendship against sorrow. Two cards of the same number, however, often mean a transformation. And the crossing card often emerges from the first in some way. Looking deeper into the reading, I saw the two as connected, not opposed. Acceptance and love can turn pain into joyful memory, an embracing of life.","### REVERSED

The healing process becomes blocked when we fight acceptance. If something in life appears too painful we may push it away, try not to think about it, and avoid any reminders. Such an attitude keeps the pain forever with us, and in fact increases its hold. Waite writes: ‘mental alienation ... disorder, confusion’. A reading once for a woman showed great potential for development in many areas, yet the outcome appeared very mediocre, weak. In the position of background lay the Three of Swords reversed. Earlier the woman had spoken of the ways in which she had never got over the death of her father.",Three of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,190,1022
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_9_two_of_swords,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_9,"## TWO OF SWORDS
One method of handling problems or opposition is to push everything away beyond an emotional fence. If we let nothing approach us, then nothing can hurt us. In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them.
Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold.
Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blindfolded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that behind the Priestess.
The weight of the swords makes it easy for the woman to be tipped over into the choppy waters. Because it makes us concentrate on the emotions, a defensive attitude makes us more prone to outbursts, to anger and hysteria. We also might compare the Two of Swords to Justice, whose number, 11, reduces to 2. Justice carries one Sword, for a sharp mind, but she wears no blindfold, preferring absolute honesty.","### Reversed

The balance is lost — or given up. Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside.",Two of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,378,2141
seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot_chapter_9_ace_of_swords,seventy_eight_degree_of_wisdom_tarot,chapter_9,"## ACE OF SWORDS
The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize abstract truth, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intuition, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience.
Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit.
The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the mind can pierce the fog and knots to give a clear understanding of the real facts. Truth expresses the Ace in its most valuable form. On another level the card signifies simply emotional force, both love and hate, in extreme forms. Notice the tight grip. The emotions, too, are a gift, enabling us to experience life intensely, but they always remain hard to hold and harder still to direct. For people who have suffered abuse of some kind, focusing on the Ace of Swords can act as a way of bringing to the surface repressed anger.","### Reversed

The grip fails, bringing illusion, confused ideas and feelings, overpowering emotions. The more violent feelings overcome the benevolent ones. Without a clear sense of reality, the mind can fall prey to mistakes created by emotion. Problems become exaggerated; everything, including attractions, appears to be more important than it actually is. In such situations, the Ace of Swords reversed tells us to take hold of ourselves and try to find a balanced sense of reality.",Ace of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,315,1886

**Alternative Names:** The Jester, The Idiot

**Element:** Air
**Hebrew Letter:** Aleph
**Symbol:** The ox
**Meaning:** Instinct
**Tree of Life Pathway:** First, between Kether and Chockmah
**Chakra:** Crown, for spiritual connection, and base, for survival
**Key Meanings:** Innocence, risk, and beginnings
### UNDERSTANDING THE FOOL
The Fool is the innocent adventurer, about to begin an important journey. With a head full of hope, he is idealistic rather than practical; he is certainly not dressed for travel. The little dog at his heels tries to warn him of impending peril, but the Fool is blissfully ignorant of the risk he takes in stepping off a cliff. He is about to encounter danger, but how else can he make his way in the world?
We all begin life as a zero, a tiny egg of potential. The Fool is the cosmic egg, symbolized by the shape of his number, 0. As he journeys through the major arcana sequence, he is a part of every card, but he also stands outside the sequence, without a formal value. An absolute beginner, he is about to explore the world, gain experience, and leave behind his status as a zero, a no-being. He will travel lightly, without the baggage of commitment. The Fool is the dreamer, lead only by his needs and desires.
Usually depicted as a youth, the Fool must grow to become a man in the next card in the tarot sequence: the Magician-an individual who knows life and has identified what he needs to succeed in it. The Fool on his journey will collect, in his bag, the four symbols of the minor arcana suits (the Cup, Sword, Pentacle, and Wand): These items are the essence of his survival-the Cup to drink from; the Sword to defend himself; the Pentacle, a coin, for victuals; and the Wand to connect him with his higher self. At this stage of his journey, he is yet to discover the power and meaning of these objects; when he fully understands their purpose, he may progress to the next stage of life, ready to morph into card I, the Magician. Even though his number is zero, his preceding card is the World, card XXI. Some tarotists even assign him number XXII/0, to show that the Fool is both the end and the beginning of the card sequence.
### THE FOOL'S ASTROLOGY
The Fool's element is Air, which is fitting, given he is about to step off a precipice into the ether and on his travels will go wherever the wind blows. While the Fool is not linked with a zodiac sign, he does have a planet, Uranus, which symbolizes independence and a free spirit.
### THE FOOL AND KABBALA
The Fool's letter is Aleph, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It has no sound
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright fool signifies calculated risk. It's never too late to begin anew and follow your heart's desire. The journey ahead is not without danger, but it is time to take a leap of faith. This card augers well for those embarking on new enterprises and educational courses, provided sensible planning is in place; this is a time for optimism and a fresh perspective.
The Fool brings an opportunity to start over and feel young again or excited at the prospect of a new way of living; the Fool is an embodiment of your spirit, whether male or female, ready to explore and discover. Whatever you start now will go well, provided you do look before you leap-but once the decision is made, it's time to push forward and not look back; have courage, commit to your path, and be fully in the moment. The Fool's appearance in a reading can bring a sigh of relief, in that there is now a way ahead. Welcome in the new and travel lightly.
Here are some insights the Fool can offer in particular areas of life:
* **Home:** The Fool can show a young person leaving home for the first time. Also, surprise visitors could call. You may also have younger guests in your home.
* **Relationships:** A new relationship-go with the flow at this point.
* **Career and money:** You may have sabbatical or a new opportunity in your current job or a new career or enterprise. Prioritizing your workload is also the key to moving ahead swiftly.
### HIS WISDOM MESSAGE
Leap, but look first.
### THE FOOL'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Fool appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The dog represents instinct and self-preservation. The animal tries to warn the Fool that he is about to walk off a cliff, but the Fool is oblivious to his warning.
See this symbol on card XVIII, The Moon.
* The white rose or butterfly: The white rose stands for purity and innocence. Some cards show the Fool with a butterfly, a symbol of dreams and spirit.
See the white rose symbol on card XIII, Death.
* The bundle: The Fool carries little in his bundle-just his essentials and four talismans, the symbols of the minor arcana.
* The white sun: This is a symbol of consciousness, of the workings of the mind that are directly expressed. As the sun rises, it illuminates the Fool's world, showing it all in the best possible light. The sun is white, which links with the Fool's chakra of the crown and has purity of spirit.
See the golden sun on card VI, The Lovers; XIV, Temperance; XIII, Death; XVIII, The Moon; and XIX, The Sun.
* The red feather: The red feather in the Fool's cap denotes his life force.
See this symbol on card XIX, The Sun, and XIII, Death.
### THE HISTORICAL FOOL: IDIOT AND JOKER
In the earliest tarots, the Visconti-Sforza, the Fool looks very different from the jester-boy we see on twentieth-century decks. With feathers in his hair and his breeches down to his knees, the historical Fool is a figure of ridicule-the village idiot, without dignity-yet the overarching theme of the Fool of Renaissance Europe was as a signifier of Lent. The seven chicken feathers in his hair and his traveler's bundle represent a poor man. He is not a court jester but rather a symbol of poverty, a temporary reminder that worldly goods are not everything; what is in our hearts is more important.
The Fool archetype was part of the Roman festival of Saturnalia (see page 11) in which the major arcana characters paraded in chariots while the Fool ran around to tease and torment them. This is another reason why he is unnumbered-he had no official place in the procession. The Fool survives today as the Joker in the standard fifty-two pack of playing cards.
### THE FOOL'S REFLECTIONS
The beginner aspect of the Fool is held in the minor arcana's four Aces: the Ace of Cups (new love), the Ace of Pentacles (new money), the Ace of Wands (new initiatives), and the Ace of Swords (new success); see pages 120, 148, 204, and 176. He is also reflected in the Three of Wands, for travel, and the Eight of Wands, for movement, messages, and activity.
### THE FOOL'S REFLECTIONS
Take the Fool from your deck and set him before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan the cards out facedown. Choose five cards with your left hand and lay them out, as shown. You could ask, ""What do I need to do to follow my path in life?"" or ""Is this risk worth taking?""

THE MAGICIAN.
### UNDERSTANDING THE MAGICIAN
Here we have a Magician in action, complete with magic wand and the implements of his trade on the table before him: the suit symbols of the Pentacle or coin, Cup, Sword, and Wand, representing the four elements of earth, water, air, and fire, respectively. With these base materials, he sets an intention to transmute them to create the fifth element of ether, or the quintessence-the mythological ""breath of the gods."" The Magician, who once journeyed as the Fool, is now ready to manifest his desires by aligning spirit and matter. As the conduit between earth and heaven, the Magician stands for decisions and creativity. The roses and lilies growing above and below him tell us that life can be beautiful when we commit to our passions.
In the major arcana sequence, the Magician comes after 0, The Fool, although the Magician can also be seen as the first card of the cycle, as some tarotists place the Fool after the World card as XXII. The Magician is the natural successor to the Fool as we move from 0, the cosmic egg, to I, the individual: The Fool's bundle contains the Magician's four symbols, ready to be activated. After the singular purpose of the Magician we meet II, The High Priestess, who introduces us to the duality of life-the now and the hereafter.
The Magician's number, I, is the first prime number, which stands for primal energy, the individual, and oneness with the divine spirit or God. The card is related to X, The Wheel of Fortune (10 reduces to 1), and XIX, or 19, The Sun, which reduces to 10 then 1, the Magician's number. Both these cards link with an awareness of realms beyond the earthly plane.
### THE MAGICIAN'S ASTROLOGY
The Magician's ruling planet is Mercury, also the Roman god of magic-and the Greek Hermes, god of communication, linked with the Egyptian god Thoth. In alchemy, mercury's form as quicksilver was associated with transformation or the fifth element of ether. The element could also be signified by the symbol of a snake, shown on the Magician's serpent-girdle (see The Magician's Symbols).
### THE MAGICIAN AND KABBALA
The Hebrew letter of the Magician is Beth, symbolized by a house, meaning creativity. On the Tree of Life pathway, the Magician is placed on the second pathway between the spheres of Kether and Binah. Kether stands for unity, echoing the card's number, I, while Binah is the sphere of experience-indicating practical magic and singular direction.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
It's time for action-for communicating and expressing your ideas and desires. This is the card of the inventor, the traveler, the self-employed, and the entrepreneur, as it beckons you to broaden your horizons. You will have the drive to spur your plans forward, and, perhaps, to take new, creative approaches: to think laterally, ask questions, trust your internal guidance, and let go of procrastination.
Blessed with a magic wand, you have the ability to transform whatever you choose, and in this way, the Magician is a very positive card in a reading. He directs you to make the most of your skills and talents and step into your power; focus on your projects and capitalize on your personal strengths. Spiritually, the Magician shows you connecting with your higher, or true, self and acting with pure intention.
This card can also show a significant journey.
Here are some other possibilities:
* **Home:** A house sale is completed, or you decide it is time to move forward with remodeling plans. This is a sociable time, with lots of visitors and entertaining.
* **Relationships:** If you are single and want love, it is coming. If you are in a relationship, the Magician shows love in action, so you will begin to see commitment. Communication between you is excellent and you reach an even deeper understanding of each other's needs. The card can also show you acting as one, so a joint project may be on the horizon, too.
* **Career and money:** There will be a new beginning, either finding new employment or a new direction in your existing work. This card can also show inspired leadership from a grounded and enthusiastic individual.
### HIS WISDOM MESSAGE
Manifest your desires.
### THE MAGICIAN'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Magician appears with the following magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The lemniscate or infinity symbol: balance, activity, and renewal
See this symbol on card VIII, Strength.
* The magic wand: The wand is double-ended and reflects the Hermetic concept ""As above, so below,"" or heaven and earth as mirrors. The wand's symbolism reflects that of the Magician's pose (see below).
See this symbol on cards VII, The Chariot, and XXI, The World.
* The four suit symbols: These are the Magician's resources. He draws upon the four elements of the suits to create the quintessence, the fifth element.
* The red cloak: energy and action; practicality; and being grounded in the material world
See this symbol on IV, The Emperor; V, the Hierophant; and XI, Justice.
* The headband: The mind and the intention to manifest desires
* The Magician and his pose: The Magician is the conduit of energy between earth, which he draws from with his downward left hand, and heaven, symbolized by his raised hand and wand.
* The serpent-girdle: The belt around the Magician's waist is a serpent, a symbol of the element of Mercury, the Magician's ruling planet (see The Magician's Astrology). To function as a belt, the serpent or snake must hold
Its tail in its mouth. This is the alchemical symbol of the ouroborus, which like the lemniscate stands for infinity and constant renewal-just as the snake continually sheds its skin.
* The roses and lilies: The red roses symbolize love and the lilies, truth of purpose. The Magician acts with pure intention. See red roses on the gown in card III, The Empress, and on the gown of the supplicant on the left on card V, The Hierophant; roses are also around the waist of the maiden on VIII, Strength.
* Yellow background: consciousness, clear sight and support See this on III, The Empress; VII, The Chariot; VIII, Strength; and XI, Justice.
### THE HISTORICAL MAGICIAN: MAN AND GOD
Historically, the Magician has had many guises. In the fifteenth-century Visconti-Sforza tarots, he was a wealthy merchant seated at a table. By the nineteenth century, the Dotti tarot of Milan assigned him as a cobbler-Il Bagatto. By the twentieth century, he had transformed into a magus, then a god.
Most early tarots show the Magician seated at a table, while a standing pose appears to have been generally accepted by the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as seen in Marseilles-style tarots. But in our Rider-Waite deck, the standing Magician takes on a spiritual dimension, pointing to heaven and earth. Aleister Crowley takes the Magician a step further in his Thoth deck, showing his Magus card as the winged messenger-god Hermes, or Mercury, also the ruling planet of the card. Hermes as a god represented wisdom and was believed to be the architect of the pyramids and the creator of mathematics, astrology, and other arts. The Magician today embodies this spirit of invention, enterprise, and expression.
### THE MAGICIAN'S REFLECTIONS
Because the Magician has all four suits represented on his table-Cup, Pentacle, Sword, and Wand-he can be seen as the ruler of the entire minor arcana. His appearance in a reading can ask you to pay particular attention to the minors-note which suits or elements they represent, as this will give you an instant overview of which life area is important now.
### TRY A READING WITH THE MAGICIAN: THE MAGIC WAND
Take the Magician from your deck and lay him before you, as shown. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown.
Choose four cards with your left hand and place them around the Magician in the positions below. You could ask, ""What can I manifest?"" or ""What do I need to do to make my idea work?""

* Card 2: Emotional strengths
* Card 3: Practical skills and resources

**Alternative Name:** The Papess
**Number:** II

**Astrological Sign or Planet:** The Moon
**Element:** Water
**Hebrew Letter:** Gimel
**Symbol:** Camel
**Meaning:** Wisdom
**Tree of Life Pathway:** Third, between Kether and Tiphareth
**Chakra:** Fifth eye, also known as the angelic or soma chakra, for psychic activation
**Key Meanings:** Secrets, wisdom, and the spiritual world
### UNDERSTANDING THE HIGH PRIESTESS
The High Priestess stands in an enclosed chamber or temple between two great pillars labeled B and J. Behind her is a veil decorated with pomegranates and date fruit; she wears a horned moon headdress like the Egyptian goddess Hathor, and at her feet lies a crescent moon. She holds a scroll that is partly hidden, bearing the letters t, o, r, and a, indicating the Torah, the Jewish sacred text. She represents the principle of the divine feminine; historically, she is the female Pope, a virgin priestess, signified by her blue-and-white robes. Today, she might be the psychic, astrologer, or spiritual teacher. Her spiritual path is above material values and earthly relationships. Her gift is wisdom; and knowledge of the world beyond the veil, the realms of gods, guides, and angels.
The number of the High Priestess is II, echoed in the two pillars of the temple of Solomon (see The High Priestess's Symbols). Her counterpart in the major arcana sequence is card V, The Hierophant or High Priest. Like the High Priestess, he is a mentor, but he works in public office-the High Priestess, however, tends her inner garden of the spirit in secret, walking between the earth plane and the celestial realms beyond, separated by the pomegranate veil. She lives a dual life. She comes after I, The Magician, card of unity and outward expression, and before card III, The Empress. The High Priestess reveals that we need superconsciousness and awareness of the self before we can wholly engage in abundant relationships with others, which are embodied by the mother-goddess Empress.
She is numerologically linked with cards XI, Justice (11; 1 + 1 = 2), and XX, Judgment (2 + 0 = 2). Both these cards illuminate the need for discernment, wisdom, and discretion.
### THE HIGH PRIESTESS'S ASTROLOGY
The High Priestess's element is Water, the element of the emotions, and her planet is the moon. The moon relates to intuition, the feminine cycles, and the rhythms of nature. She wears a crown showing the moon's waxing, waning, and full phases (see The High Priestess's Symbols).
### THE HIGH PRIESTESS AND KABBALA
The High Priestess's kabbalistic letter is Gimel, the third letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which literally means camel, but also suggests wisdom. On the Tree of Life, she is placed on the third pathway, between the spheres of Kether and Tiphareth, or oneness with God and harmony/rebirth-a journey to inner peace
### UPRIGHT MEANING
Hidden knowledge, intuition, psychic experience, and significant dreams are the gifts of the High Priestess. This is a time for incubation and privacy, to go inward, deepening your relationship with your higher self and trusting your internal knowing. In your everyday life, confidentiality is key. If you have a secret, or a project you are nurturing, it is better to keep your own counsel.
On your spiritual path, the High Priestess predicts learning and a mentor. As the card of psychic gifts (along with card X, The Wheel of Fortune), her arrival in your reading can be a sign to follow your intuition and connect with your guides. If the High Priestess shows up in one of your first tarot readings, this is often a sign that tarot is part of your spiritual journey. Here are some other signs she can reveal:
* **Home:** It's a quiet time. Relations between family members may be calm but a little distant; you may be buried in your separate lives just now.
* **Relationships:** This can mean being single for a time or, if you are in a relationship, you or your partner choosing to keep a part of your life separate, or secret.
* **Career and money:** Success is coming, but contracts and new work are taking time to nurture. You can only be patient.
### HER WISDOM MESSAGE
Explore your spiritual side.
### THE HIGH PRIESTESS'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the High Priestess appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The two pillars: The initials B and J refer to Boaz and Jachin, names on pillars in the Temple of Solomon in the Old Testament, which were decorated with pomegranate designs (see pomegranate below). Boaz represents the elements of Water and Earth, and Jachin, Fire and Air. The pillars are black and white, to show duality-male and female, darkness and light, and the earthly and heavenly dimensions that the High Priestess inhabits. The pillars form a portal to otherworldly experience and a deeper experience of the self. See this symbol on cards V, The Hierophant, and XI, Justice, to symbolize balance.
* The scroll: The High Priestess holds the Sefer Torah, a hand-written scroll central to the study of Kabbala. It symbolizes the High Priestess's spiritual knowledge. See the book as a symbol on card X, The Wheel of Fortune.
* The pomegranate: On the High Priestess's veil, the pomegranate denotes female fertility, linking with her aspect as the Egyptian goddess Hathor (see the moon below). The pomegranate can also be a symbol of the Jewish sacred text-it has been taught that the fruit has 613 seeds, echoing the Torah's 613 biblical commandments.
* The veil: The veil symbolizes the otherworld beyond the material world.
* The date: Masculinity, complementing the female pomegranate
* The moon: This is a symbol of the subconscious and the emotions that lie beneath the solar or external persona. The moon is shown in three phases as a crown to echo Hathor/Isis, the Egyptian goddess of life and fertility who gave birth to Ra, god of the sun. See this symbol on card XVIII, The Moon.
* The blue-and-white robes: White is for purity, relating to the traditional virginity of the nun. Blue is for truth, as in ""true blue.""
### THE HISTORICAL HIGH PRIESTESS: FEMALE POPES
In the Visconti-Sforza tarots (see page 10), the High Priestess bears the likeness of Maria Visconti, a relative of the Duke of Milan, who commissioned some of the earliest tarot cards. Maria was a nun and a member of the Guglielmite sect, which believed that Christ would return to earth in 1300 and a female pope would rule. Maria, also known as Sister Manfreda, was chosen to become the first female pope-hence the card's alternative name, The Papess. Before her ambition could be realized, she was burned at the stake as a heretic in 1300.
The High Priestess as the Papess also links with the legend of St. Joan, chronicled in the thirteenth century by the Dominican monk Stephen of Bourbon. His myth tells of a ninth-century Englishwoman named Joan who eloped with a Benedictine monk. To disguise herself, she dressed as a man and named herself John of England. Her lover died, but she traveled to Rome, became a highly respected educator, and eventually was elected Pope. However, during the coronation procession she collapsed with labor pains, and her true identity as a woman was exposed. How she died varies according to different accounts-from instant demise after the birth, to being stoned to death, to being deposed and punished. Her child survived, and in the legend he was identified as the Bishop of Ostia, one of the diocese of Rome.
In Marseilles-style tarots of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the High Priestess wears a papal crown, but otherwise this learned woman is very much as we see her in the Rider-Waite card, seated and robed, holding a holy book.
### THE HIGH PRIESTESS'S REFLECTIONS
* The Queen of Swords, for strength of will and following your path
* The Eight of Pentacles, for study, knowledge, and reward
### TRY A READING WITH THE HIGH PRIESTESS: THE ORACLE

Symbol: Door
Meaning: Attainment

### UNDERSTANDING THE EMPRESS
The Empress is the mother archetype, symbol of creativity and abundance. She bears the symbol of Venus on her shield, relating to her planet, Venus, and the Roman goddess of love. In pre-Roman times, Venus was much more than the ruler of relationships: She was the earth mother, nature herself. She is seated in an earthly paradise, where corn grows at her feet. A river meanders then flows into a waterfall, forming an abundant pool. All the trees are in full leaf. This is summer, a time of harvest and plenty. The Empress leans slightly back, supported by a cushion and bolster, as if she has transplanted herself from indoors to her garden. While living in the material world, she stays connected to her roots and goes with the flow of life. Her pose and lose gown may suggest she is pregnant, and some decks show an obviously pregnant Empress. While the High Priestess is lunar and virginal, incubating herself spiritually to connect with the twilight realms beyond, the Empress manifests her femininity. She is the solar, earthly, and fertile aspect of womanhood, also indicated by the rich yellows, reds, oranges, and green colors of her card. Her number, III, is dynamic and creative and stands for the triad of mother, father, and child. In early decks such as the Visconti-Sforza tarots, she is shown with a black eagle, matching the insignia of card IV, The Emperor-she is clearly an empress rather than a queen; the four Queens are her aspects (see The Empress's Reflections). As the consort of card IV, The Emperor, the Empress also represents the wife and traditional relationships. She is numerologically connected with XII, The Hanged Man-time suspended, presumably during pregnancy-and XXI, The World, expressing the joy of birth or creation.
### THE EMPRESS'S ASTROLOGY
The Empress is linked with Venus, planet of love, and with warmth, relationships, light, and abundance.
### THE EMPRESS AND KABBALA
The Empress's Hebrew letter is Daleth, or door, and attainment. As a mother, she represents the gateway to new life. This also complements the Hebrew letter of her tarot partner, the Emperor, which is Hei, the window: two aspects of the house of the soul.
On the Tree of Life, she is placed on the fourth pathway between the spheres of Binah and Chockmah. Binah is female intelligence, while Chockmah is male wisdom. The seeds of male and female within the Empress conceive new life.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The gifts of the Empress are abundance and material comfort, sensuality and security, and emotional support. This is an auspicious card for children and families, showing harmony at home; if you are hoping to begin a family, the Empress symbolizes fertility and femininity. Your creative projects thrive and you prosper financially now, too. The Empress is resourceful, so when she appears in your reading, you can feel assured that your needs will be met. This card, therefore, shows the influence of a nurturing mother figure who supports you. As the you/your situation card in a reading, it reveals you are a good mother to others-and to yourself.
Here are some additional possibilities:
* **Home:** renovation and extensions, home improvements; considering a move to a larger home; tending a garden
* **Relationships:** Happiness-If single, this indicates a good time to begin a relationship. Harmonious relationships exist within the family.
* **Career and money:** Security; money flows-In work, you are resourceful, able to support others, and come up with inventive ways to manage your projects.
### HER WISDOM MESSAGE
Life is abundant.
### THE EMPRESS'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Empress appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The starry crown: The half-crown, or diadem, holds twelve stars, a common emblem on paintings of the Virgin Mary; the Book of Revelation 12:1-2 mentions a woman, interpreted as Mary, as, ""Clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."" The twelve stars may signify the twelve tribes of Israel, and some tarotists associate them with the twelve astrological signs. The number twelve signifies unity.
* The laurel wreath: The wreath the Empress wears just below her crown shows peace and success. See this victory symbol on the Six of Wands, the Two of Cups, and the Seven of Cups.
* Pomegranates: The pomegranate design on the Empress's dress denotes fertility, death, and rebirth and relates to the myth of the Greek goddess of the harvest, Demeter. The fate of her daughter, Persephone, was determined by Persephone eating the seeds of the pomegranate in the underworld (see The Historical Empress). See this symbol on card II, The High Priestess.
* The pearl necklace: The seven pearls, meaning wisdom, also represent the seven major chakras in harmony-base, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, and crown (see page 235). The seven pearls also link with the seven classical planets.
* The shield with the sign of Venus: The Venus sign-the circle with the cross beneath-is associated with the goddess Venus, for love, beauty, and creativity. It embodies the sun and the earth.
* The scepter: This is an emblem of state. The Empress is ruler of her own land and is secure in her authority. The orb atop it and the Empress's hand position echoes the shape of the sign of Venus. (See Venus above.)
* The corn: The ripe corn, ready for harvest, stands for rewards, fertility, and abundance. (See The Historical Empress.)
Yellow background: consciousness, clear sight, and support
See this on the I, The Magician; VII, The Chariot; VIII, Strength; and XI, Justice.
### THE HISTORICAL EMPRESS: ROOTS OF THE GODDESS
The Empress is the great mother goddess at the heart of many ancient beliefs: the Roman Venus and Diana; the Sumerian Innana, Queen of Heaven; the Celtic goddess Brigid; the Egyptian deities Hathor and Isis; the Virgin Mary; the Nordic goddesses Freyja and Frigg; the Greek Aphrodite and Gaia; and the Hindu Parvati. The ripe corn shown in the foreground of the card also associates the Empress with Demeter, the ""grain mother,"" Greek goddess of the harvest and the cycles of nature. When Demeter's daughter, Persephone, was abducted by Hades, Demeter bargained to get her back by threatening to withhold the grain harvest. It was agreed that Persephone could return to her mother, but only if she had not eaten anything when with Hades. Alas, Persephone had eaten six seeds of the pomegranate (the fruit depicted on the dress of the Empress). And so Persephone was allowed to return to her mother and the earth for six months of the year, through spring and summer, but cursed to spend the other six months of fall and winter in the darkness that was Hades-a metaphor for the rhythms of the seasons that the mother-goddess Empress embodies.
### THE EMPRESS'S REFLECTIONS
* The Queen of Cups, for love and nurturing-the heart aspect
* The Queen of Pentacles, for generosity and security-the physical body
* The Queen of Swords, for the intellect-the mind aspect
* The Queen of Wands, for creativity and communication-the soul aspect
* Nine of Pentacles, for money, luxury, and self-authority

THE EMPEROR.
### UNDERSTANDING THE EMPEROR
The Emperor is the father archetype, a symbol of male power and virility. His beard shows he is a man of maturity and wisdom, a forerunner of the Hermit, the other bearded man of the tarot, whom the Emperor will become in later years. Yet at this time of his existence, he is still full of vigor and ready to take action to defend his realm, as we see from the battle armor showing beneath his robes of state.
His number is IV, for the four compass points and for stability and order. The Emperor is sure of his position, and he sits squarely in place on his throne of stone, high-backed and secure in a landscape that appears to be little more than barren rock. Yet the mountains, almost equal in height on each side, seem to protect him, and his throne, higher than the peaks of the rocks, suggests he is in control of this strange environment. A tiny river runs behind him, perceptible at the base of the mountains-a sign of the potential for growth and cultivation of the land as he directs. The Emperor is a pioneer and a true Aries, shown by the rams' heads on his throne; his will drives him forward.
And as the Emperor knows the boundaries of his territory, he is realistic about the sphere of his influence. He also maintains and defends his boundaries appropriately, through rational negotiation rather than force.
In the major arcana sequence, the Emperor comes after his consort card III, The Empress, and before card V, The Hierophant. In traditional societies, this sequence reflected power status, from mother under father and priest at the top, being closest to God. The Emperor corresponds in numerology with card XIII, Death, perhaps linking with the Emperor's warrior aspects in that physical death would have been very much part of life as a feudal ruler. The Emperor and Death are the only two major arcana cards that show figures with visible leg armor.
### THE EMPEROR'S ASTROLOGY
The Emperor's astrological sign is Aries, the Ram the first sign of the zodiac (March 21-April 20). He has fire and determination, the qualities of leadership. Aries is ruled by Mars, planet of war, indicated by the Emperor's armor. It is known as the fiery planet, echoed in the color orange in the landscape behind the Emperor's throne and his red robes, which are also a sign of his sovereignty.
### THE EMPEROR AND KABBALA
The Emperor's Hebrew letter is Hei, which means progress. Another meaning of Hei is window, or portal, through which streams the light of consciousness. He is fully aware of who he is and of his place in the world. Placed on the fifth Tree of Life pathway between the spheres of Tiphareth, for beauty and rebirth, and Chockmah, male principle.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
In a reading, the Emperor can denote a powerful man, and the traditional male aspects of rulership and ambition. As the consort of card III, The Empress, he signifies the husband or other intimate partner who is constant and trustworthy. He is in control of his emotions, and comfortable with who he is. Less appealing, depending on your perspective, is his need for conformity. Although he may have ambition, tradition is essential to his happiness. As a general influence or symbol of the self he brings balance, security, and conventional values. He reveals mastery of life and control over territory, and predicts that problems can be overcome with careful planning and single-mindedness. He shows a return to order, so his arrival in your reading is a welcome sign of improvement in your circumstances. You may also be offered protection from someone you trust; you can also trust yourself to make the right decisions.
It's time to live in the here and now, and use what practical resources you possess-wisdom, determination, and the skills of others-to realize your next steps. Be the leader.
Here's what he represents in specific areas of your life:
* **Home:** Order and smooth running. However, it is also important to set boundaries and protect what is yours.
* **Relationships:** A new partner, or focusing on practical matters and future planning in established partnerships. Loyalty in love.
* **Career and money:** Finances get organized and you plan how to balance expenditures. You can expect to have fairness at work and to be sure of your goals; you will either enjoy this new structure or feel it stifles your creativity.
### HIS WISDOM MESSAGE
Take control; you are protected.
### THE EMPEROR'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Emperor appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The rams' heads: There are four ram's heads on the card, echoing his number IV: two forward-facing on the front of his throne and two in profile on the top corners. They are the symbol of the Emperor's sign, Aries the Ram. In Egyptian mythology, Khnum, an aspect of the sun god, Ra, was depicted with the head of a ram. Khnum was a god of creation, also known as the Divine Potter, who molded children from the clay of the Nile.
* The golden apple and ankh: The stylized ankh, the Egyptian symbol for life and reproduction, stands for masculine virility. The Emperor holds the ankh in his right hand-the hand associated with giving. In his left hand, he shows what he receives: the golden apple, symbol of love and sexuality associated with the Roman goddess Venus. Venus's symbol appears on the Empress, the Emperor's partner. In this way the ankh and apple denote their relationship and the male and female archetypes.
* Armour: The armour is a symbol of strength, defense, and action in the world. Battle is a quality of the planet Mars, ruler of the Emperor's sign of Aries. See this symbol on card VII, The Chariot.
* The red cloak: energy and action; being in the material world. See this symbol on card I, The Magician; V, The Hierophant; and XI, Justice.
* The crown: A power symbol, the Emperor's crown sits on the crown chakra of the head, the connection point with the higher self. It shows autonomy and self-direction. The crown is closed, showing the Emperor's self-containment and self-reliance. See variants of the crown on II, The High Priestess; III, The Empress; V, The Hierophant; VII, The Chariot; VIII, Strength; XI, Justice; XVI, The Tower; the Six of Wands; the Ace of Swords; the Four of Pentacles; and the Kings and Queens of the minor arcana suits.
### THE HISTORICAL EMPEROR: WENCESLAS AND CHARLEMAGNE
One of The Emperor's historical emblems is the black eagle, which appears on his hat in the Visconti-Sforza tarots (see page 10)-the bird was an insignia of the Visconti family and the Holy Roman Empire, which gave the family official permission to bear it. The historical Emperor may be Wenceslas of Bohemia (1205-1253), who married into the family of Roman Emperor Frederick I; other sources suggest the original Emperor may be Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor (c. 742-814). The Marseilles tarot (1701-1715) shows the Emperor side-on, just as we would see the profile of kings and other dignitaries on coins and playing cards.
### THE EMPEROR'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Emperor in these minor arcana cards:
* The Four of Pentacles, for for financial stability
* The King of Cups, for love and intuition-the heart aspect
* The King of Pentacles, for generosity and security-the physical body
* The King of Swords, for the intellect-the mind aspect
* The King Wands, for creativity and communication-the soul aspect
### TRY A READING WITH THE EMPEROR: KNOWING YOUR BOUNDARIES
Take the Emperor from your deck and lay him before you in the center of the spread, as shown. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan the cards out facedown. Choose four cards with your left hand and place them around the Emperor, as shown. You could ask, ""Should I consider moving house?"" or ""How can I feel more secure?""

Greed is another aspect of the Emperor reversed.

Hebrew Letter: Vau (Vav, Wav)
Symbol: Nail or connector
Meaning: Kindness
Tree of Life Pathway: Sixth, Chesed and Chockmah
Chakra: Causal, or fourth eye, for spiritual connection
Key Meanings: Education, unity, spiritual and direction
### UNDERSTANDING THE HIEROPHANT
The Hierophant appears as a figure of religious orthodoxy. Wearing the papal crown and holding the scepter, he makes the hand gesture of blessing to two supplicants kneeling before him. He is the leader of the Catholic faith and symbolizes unity. One of his titles, Pontifex Maximus, means ""The Great Bridge-Builder""; he is the bridge between heaven and earth. He shows us the potential for integrating our internal and external worlds, bringing together body and soul, as well as our male and female self-aspects. As the priest, he officiates at weddings, joining two people together in physical and spiritual union.
The Hierophant is also a symbol of education. Also know as the Priest or the Pope, in the Rider-Waite tarot, he is named Hierophant after the *hierophantes*, or priests who guarded the Eleusinian Mysteries (see The Historical Hierophant). Through him, we may find and follow a higher path through learning. He may be a lecturer or inspiring leader, priest or magus, shaman or established esoteric teacher.
In the major arcana sequence, the Hierophant appears between card IV, The Emperor, and VI, The Lovers. We are moving from the Emperor's worldly domain to an encounter with the spiritual through a teacher-priest. After the Hierophant, we meet the Lovers and see God's messenger, Archangel Raphael, and then-through the sequence of these three cards-sense a progression from the earth realm to a glimpse of the divine.
The Hierophant's number is the indivisible V, the number of mankind, which indicates that he is the communicator between man and God, which is also shown by his hand gesture, symbolizing heaven and earth (see The Hierophant's Symbols). He is numerologically linked with card XIV, Temperance (14; 1 + 4 = 5, or V). The Angel of Temperance and the Hierophant are both channels for the message of God.
### THE HIEROPHANT'S ASTROLOGY
The Hierophant's sign is Taurus, the Bull the second sign of the zodiac (April 21-May 21), ruled by sensuous planet Venus and the element of Earth, which is also represented by his red robes (see The Hierophant's Symbols). This fixed sign of the zodiac has the attributes of commitment and loyalty, groundedness, and practicality.
### THE HIEROPHANT AND KABBALA
The Hierophant's kabbalistic letter is Vau, meaning nail or connector-the Hebrew letter resembles an I with a pen stroke to the left. Vau's esoteric meaning is kindness. On the Tree of Life, he is placed on the sixth pathway between the spheres of Chesed, meaning mercy and divine love, and Chockmah, or wisdom and the male principle. Chockmah is also known as the Father of Fathers and points to the Hierophant as the eternal father-god, spiritual counterpart to the mother-goddess embodied in card III, The Empress.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
In the upright position, the Hierophant shows support, self-realization, and expansion. This is a time to develop emotionally and spiritually-to commit to relationships; to think and philosophize; and to become more spiritually aware. In this way, the Hierophant offers an opportunity to integrate mind and spirit and ascend to a higher plane of awareness. Day to day, this means nurturing your talents through learning and heeding good advice. While the Hierophant offers wise counsel, he does represent institutions and traditional values-which may be a comfort to you or a test of how much you are willing to conform. Even if his conventions are not for you, the Hierophant offers an opportunity to question and define your values. As a spiritual leader, the Hierophant shows you the path to follow in a community, such as joining a study group or class through which you may learn a new skill. He also represents good judgment and fairness: The Hierophant asks you to tune your moral compass, so if you have been questioning a decision, it is time to do what is right.
Here's what else the Hierophant can symbolize:
* **Home:** Expanding your current property; inviting people into your home to share your interests
* **Relationships:** Committed partnerships; marriage; celebrating the sacred in your relationship
* **Career and money:** Progress in your organization; direction and decisions; inspired leadership and growth
### HIS WISDOM MESSAGE
Make the most of your gifts.
### THE HIEROPHANT'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Hierophant appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The papal crown: The triple crown is the symbol of papal authority. Its three layers stand for the holy trinity.
* The papal staff, or crosier: The three crosses on the Hierophant's staff stand for the Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; earth, heaven, and the spirit world; and the self, higher self, and the Christ/fully actualized self. We also see the three crosses on the Hierophant's papal robes, which are red, for earth, while the crosier is gold, for heaven.
* The crossed keys: The golden crossed keys represent the keys to the kingdom of heaven given by Jesus to St. Peter. Jesus said to Peter, ""Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven."" Heaven and earth are as one, a reminder of the Hierophant's key meaning of unity.
* The hand gesture of blessing: The blessing shows two fingers bent and two extended, representing what is seen and what is hidden from view-our visible earthly existence and the invisible heaven. The fingers are part of the same hand and, like the crossed keys, illustrate how our known and unknown worlds unite.
* The red cloak: Energy and action; being in the material world. See this symbol on cards I, The Magician; IV, The Emperor; and XI, Justice.
* The roses and lilies: The red roses symbolize love and the white lilies, purity. See this symbol on cards I, The Magician; the roses around the waist of the maiden on VIII, Strength; and red roses on the gown of card III, The Empress.
### THE HISTORICAL HIEROPHANT: SECRET RITES
The Hierophant was named in the Rider-Waite tarot after *hierophant*, a general term meaning someone who introduced others to holiness-*hierophant* in Greek was *ta hiera* and *phainen*, meaning to show. Hierophantes was also the title of the High Priests of the Greek religion of Eleusis, who officiated at the Eleusinian Mysteries. This was a famous initiation ceremony and festival that took place at Eleusis, near Athens. The rites were secret, but involved the afterlife and the retelling of the story of Demeter the grain mother and her daughter, Persephone, who was abducted by Hades (see the Empress, page 42). The Hierophant was always chosen from a family named Eumolpidae, who had a mythical ancestor, Eumolpus, whose parents were the gods Poseidon and Chione. The Hierophant was the keeper of sacred mysteries, and he was renowned for his beautiful and hypnotic voice-which perhaps explains the emphasis on listening in many Hierophant card interpretations.
In early tarot cards, the Hierophant card was the Pope. The card's title changed in some seventeenth- and eighteenth-century decks in response to religious sensitivity. For example, Jupiter replaced the Pope in the Tarot de Besancon of 1818, and Bacchus, god of wine, is the Pope of the Belgian tarot of 1770.
### THE HIEROPHANT'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of The Hierophant in these minor arcana cards:
* The Nine of Wands, for defending your faith at any cost; protecting what is known
* The Six of Cups, for familiarity, harmony, and the past
* The Two of Cups, for love partnerships
### TRY A READING WITH THE HIEROPHANT: FINDING A MENTOR OR SOUL MATE
Take the Hierophant from your deck and lay him before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose three cards with your left hand and place them around the Hierophant as shown. You could ask, ""Will I find a mentor at this time?"" or ""Will I have a soul connection with this person?""

Two Lovers arrive in a magical garden where strange flowers bloom and snakes talk. The full sun beams behind a luminous Archangel Raphael, angel of love and healing, who presides over their union. The Lovers stand in the Garden of Eden together, yet the woman, Eve, is gazing up at Archangel Raphael, who is holding up his right hand, explaining to them that they will be cast out of the garden if they eat the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Their innocent paradise will end-a metaphor for the seeming perfection of a new relationship before we must negotiate the practicalities. The man, Adam-who could also be the Fool on his journey through the tarot-gazes directly at Eve. They may be called the Lovers, but they are not Lovers yet: See the clouds between them? The clouds predict the Fall and the hurdles they will overcome as their relationship becomes grounded in reality. All looks perfect in Eden, but Eve and Adam are only just about to recognize each other and know love. From this point onward, we know the snake will tempt Eve to eat the fruit, and their relationship will change forever. In the major arcana sequence, the Lovers arrive after card V, The Hierophant. One of his meanings is marriage and the integration of male and female aspects. After the Lovers comes card VII, The Chariot-we have made our love decision, and the tension released drives us forward. The Lovers' number is VI, the number of harmony, love, and growth. It is also associated with healing and so links with the healing Archangel Raphael. The card's numerological link is XV, The Devil, who stands for the shadow side of love, when issues of control and possessiveness take hold.
### THE LOVERS' ASTROLOGY
The Lovers' sign is Gemini, the Twins (May 22-June 21), or the dual aspects of male and female, light and shadow. Loving our whole selves, in all our aspects, raises our consciousness to love God/the universe/the Great Spirit as the creator of the divine spark within. Eve is also Adam's twin, as she was created from him.
### THE LOVERS AND KABBALA
The Lovers' Hebrew letter is Zain, or sword-it can also connote the penis. As swords are the suit of Air in the tarot and symbolize clear thought and action, this relates to the card's meaning of decisions. The tarotist Jonathan Dee also comments, ""It is also interesting to note that Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden [of Eden] by an angel with a sword."" Zain can also mean soulfulness or living with an awareness of our higher selves. The Lovers is placed on the seventh pathway on the Tree of Life between the spheres of Tiphareth, for beauty, rebirth, and ascending consciousness, and Binah, for understanding, the goddess, and the female principle.
### UPRIGHT MEAING
The Lovers show relationships and a decision. The card can predict meeting a new partner or a career opportunity, and your choice now will have a significant effect on your future. In the upright position, the person coming into your orbit now has a positive influence and offers true love-provided you follow the guidance of your heart rather than your head. If you are willing to take a risk rather than stay with a safe choice, you may soon discover your own Garden of Eden, which is fertile and rich with possibility. If you are already in a relationship, a decision whether to take your partnership to a deeper level will be made. The issue that the Lovers card raises is your ability to make a decision based on your long-term future rather than short-term gains. In this way, you are being asked to make a mature decision that supports your true needs-respect, intimacy, love, and trust-and to connect with a partner who is emotionally available to you. Whatever your situation, the message is to follow your heart's desire. An additional meaning of the Lovers card is a young person leaving home and making independent decisions.
* **Home:** If you're not living in your dream home, now is the time to work toward a property and location that will support your dreams and desires.
* **Relationships:** A love decision-Look at your patterns in previous relationships and see what your current love, or prospective new partner, can offer you that is different and ultimately more fulfilling. If you are single, love yourself first to manifest the right relationship when the time comes.
* **Career and money:** Career choices-One option may seem easier, but look carefully to ensure you are making the best decision in the long term. Look beyond money to your future development and ambitions.
### THEIR WISDOM MESSAGE
Follow the wisdom of your heart.
### THE LOVERS' SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Lovers appear with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* Archangel Raphael: The archangel of love and healing symbolizes spiritual wisdom and the healing power of love. Following the heart and committing to love as a life purpose heals us and heals others. See other Archangels on XIV Temperance (Archangel Michael), and XX Judgment (Archangel Gabriel).
* The Tree of Life: Find this on the right of the card, behind the man; it stands for the male principle. It has twelve fruits representing the twelve signs of the zodiac.
* The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil: You can see this on the left of the card, behind the woman; it stands for the female principle. The tree's fruit is sexual experience.
* The snake: Risk and wisdom-In Christianity, it is the Fall of Man: Adam and Eve's banishment from Eden when they ate the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.
### THE HISTORICAL LOVERS: WEDDINGS AND AFFAIRS
In Renaissance Italy, the Visconti family commissioned an artist to paint a set of tarot cards to commemorate the marriage of Bianca Maria Visconti and Francesco Sforza, and the joining together of two of the most powerful families in Northern Italy. Married in 1441, portraits of Bianca and Francesco were painted on the Lovers card, in which they are shown holding hands under a canopy decorated with heraldic shields and symbols with a blind cupid hovering above. The Visconti-Sforza tarots were almost a family album, featuring not only Bianca Maria and Francesco, but Bianca Maria again on the Chariot and Sister Manfreda, believed to be a relative of the Visconti family, as the High Priestess (see page 40).
In the Marseilles tarots, which may date from the fifteenth century, we see three people-two women and a man in the center. Cupid, who is not blindfolded, is about to shoot love's arrow at the couple on the right-indicating that the man will have to choose one of the women as his partner. In the tarots of Court de Gébelin (Antoine Court, 1725-1784), which appeared in his book *Le Monde Primitif* (1781), cupid favors the couple on the left of the card. The French occultist Etteilla (Jean-Baptiste Alliette, 1738-1791) created a deck with a different structure to that of traditional tarot, but with a card equivalent to the Lovers numbered 13 and named ""Mariage,"" or marriage. Here, the central figure is a priest conducting a wedding ceremony. A. E. Waite's card holds this structure of three people, but transformed the priest or cupid into the angel and draws upon the Lovers' biblical lineage as Adam and Eve.
### THE LOVERS' REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Lovers in these minor arcana cards:
* The Ace of Cups, for love
* The Two of Cups, for a new partnership
### TRY A READING WITH THE LOVERS: THE LOVE DECISION
Take the Lovers card from your deck and lay the card before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose six cards with your left hand and place them around the Lovers, as shown. You could ask, ""What are my choices, and how do I choose?""
* **Card 1:** The question
* **Card 2:** Background to the present situation
* **Cards 3 and 4:** The choices
* **Card 5:** The best action to take
* **Card 6:** The outcome

---","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Lovers card reverses, relationships go out of balance and the shadow side of your personalities enters the equation. A relationship is in crisis, and you may question your initial attraction as the values you once held as a couple feel corrupted. There may be inequality, betrayal, and dishonesty. The Lovers reversed is also an aspect of card XV, The Devil, which reveals lust, materialism, and addiction to negative patterns.",The Lovers,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1586,9228

### UNDERSTANDING THE CHARIOT
The Chariot-or the charioteer-is the traveler, standing strong in his carriage of stone and flanked by two resting sphinxes. With the city and its river behind him, he is about to move on; with determination and self-control, he will keep his vehicle on the road and be successful in his quest. At this point, his concerns are practical and material rather than mystical, yet he is aware of the heavenly realms above him, shown by his canopy of stars and the astrological symbols on his belt.
The Chariot is a culmination of the cards that precede him, and some symbols from cards 0 to VI are included on the card as evidence. About to embark on a journey, the Chariot echoes the youth aspect of the Fool. On the Chariots shoulder armor are crescent moons, for II, The High Priestess. His starry crown is like that of III, The Empress. The stone chariot resembles the Emperors throne, and its pillars those of the Hierophants chamber. The landscape evokes the Garden of Eden, home to card VI, The Lovers. The charioteer will soon find his karmic life path. To stay on it, he needs to draw together all his past experiences.
Indivisible by any other number, VII is a number of unification, mirrored in the seven days of the week, the days of the creation of the universe, and, in classical wisdom, the then-seven planets of the solar system. Seven is also the sum of three and four, which tells us that the Chariot is the child of cards III and IV, the Empress and Emperor, wearing his mothers crown and standing astride his fathers throne. His numerological correspondence is card XVI, The Tower. The shadow side of the Chariot is ego-which leads to destruction, or the Tower.
### THE CHARIOT'S ASTROLOGY
The Chariots astrological sign is Cancer the Crab (June 22-July 23), ruled by the moon. The crab has a shell, a protective vehicle for the body, like the chariot itself. The Charioteers gauntlets have a shell-like frill at the forearms.
The card also indicates the four fixed signs of Aquarius, Scorpio, Leo, and Taurus and their elements, which are symbolized by the sphinx.
### THE CHARIOT AND KABBALA
The Chariot's Hebrew letter is Chet, for fence or enclosure, a descriptor of the vehicle itself. The symbol of the square on the charioteer's breastplate may also reference the square form of the Hebrew letter Mem, which, in the ancient kabbalistic text the *Sefer Yetzirah*, means King over Water and Formed Earth in the Universe-suggesting the Chariot's crossing of the river and reaching dry land, from where he commences his journey. In the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the Chariot is positioned on the eighth pathway between the spheres of Geburah, power and destruction, and Binah, meaning understanding and the female principle or creation.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Upright Chariot signifies success and a major departure. This is a time for determination and focus as you travel in a new direction. A decision is made, and now you can begin to experience real progress in your affairs. Ready to take control and navigate your path, you are poised to learn as your horizons rapidly expand. Just as the charioteer has his wand to drive him onward, you will need willpower to fuel your desires. The Chariot can indicate a move or an important journey, and, on a mundane level, it shows you driving a car on your travels or getting a new vehicle. Following are some other possibilities:
* **Home:** Travel away from home is the focus now, rather than on extending or improving your home. You may also welcome travelers from other states or countries. Any disagreements with those you live with will be quickly overcome.
* **Relationships:** A relationship progresses at a pace; if the cards around the Chariot show endings, you may be moving on alone-but this is your rightful path.
* **Career and money:** Swift progress in business affairs-the opportunity coming your way will be challenging and exciting. Financially, you are on the road to success.
### HIS WISDOM MESSAGE
Take charge and reach for the stars.
### THE CHARIOT'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Chariot appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The chariot: The vehicle for the personality and self-expression; protection and progress
* The black and white sphinxes: The sphinx is a symbol of unity in diversity because it embodies a human face, eagle wings, the body of a lion, and the tail of a bull, which relate also to the four elements, the four suits of the minor arcana, and the four fixed signs of the zodiac (see The Chariot's Astrology). See this symbol on card X, The Wheel of Fortune.
* The armor and breastplate: The charioteer's armor symbolizes protection on his journey. On his breastplate, the alchemical symbol of the square signifies the four corners of the earth. The moon faces on the shoulder armor represent the divination stones, urmin and thummin, which in the Old Testament were used to divine God's will; it is suggested that the stones were cast to answer to a serious matter, such the decision to go to war.
* The robes: The written characters on the charioteer's robe are protective talismans. On the belt are some undefined symbols, believed to be signs of the zodiac.
* The crown: This is a symbol of authority. This crown has an eight-pointed star-this is the star from card XVII, The Star, a symbol of hope (see page 98). A laurel wreath is worn underneath it, symbolizing victory. See this symbol on III, The Empress, and XVII, The Star.
* The winged sun disk: The winged sun belonged to the Egyptian god Horus and later to the sun god, Ra; the symbol may also relate to the Greek sun god, Helios, who rode the skies in his sun chariot. In this card, the symbol denotes solar power and the conscious mind.
* Yoni-lingham: This Hindu symbol, under the wing emblem on the front of the chariot, shows the feminine organ, the yoni, and the male lingam, pictured joined to symbolize the harmonious union of male and female aspects.
* The canopy of stars: This is a symbol of hope and direction and a link with the celestial realms, seen also on the zodiac symbols on the charioteer's belt. See this symbol on card XVII, The Star.
* The magic wand: Power, creativity, and initiative See this symbol on card I, The Magician, and XXI, The World.
* Yellow background: Consciousness, clear sight, and support See this symbol on card I, The Magician; III, The Empress; VIII, Strength; and XI, Justice.
### THE HISTORICAL CHARIOT: THE PROCESSION OF TRIUMPHS
The Chariot dates back to the victory parades of ancient Rome, when victors processed through the streets in their triumphal chariot-triumph, from which the word trump (_trionfi_) is derived, also another term for the major arcana cards of the tarot. The charioteer of this parade of heroes was probably recognized by the Roman spectators as their sun god, Sol, shown by the bright yellow sunlight on the Rider-Waite card. The people of Renaissance Italy continued this tradition, known as the procession of triumphs, during which allegorical figures appeared in triumphal carts to represent all the major arcana cards. The Visconti-Sforza tarot of the fifteenth century shows a chariot pulled by two white winged horses and in it a queen resembling Bianca Maria Visconti, the woman in the Lovers card (see The Historical Lovers, page 56).
### THE CHARIOT'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Chariot in these minor arcana cards:
* The Three of Wands, for broadening horizons and travel
* The Eight of Wands, for travel and communication
### TRY A READING WITH THE CHARIOT: MOVING ON
Take the Chariot from your deck and lay the card in the center of the spread, as shown. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose seven cards with your left hand and place them around the Chariot, as shown. You could ask, ""What do I need to take me forward?"" or ""What can I experience on this new path?""

Element: Fire
Hebrew Letter: Teth
Symbol: The serpent
Meaning: Courage
Tree of Life Pathway: Ninth, between Geburah and Chesed

### UNDERSTANDING STRENGTH
This card shows strength in action: A woman in white stands calmly over a lion, holding its jaws open midway. She stays in control by holding her position, symbolized by the infinity symbol above her head. The lion signifies passion and base instincts, and the woman, civility. Although her position is precarious, she does not show fear. She communicates with the lion through her calm presence; she is not denying his power. In this way, one of the card's messages is having the courage to listen to and accept our shadow voices, our own emotional turmoil, without the fear that it will eat us up. Yet Strength personified does more than hold on: She transmutes the beast's fierce energy to a higher purpose. As one of the four cardinal virtue cards of the major arcana sequence (see page 75), Strength implies a moral victory.
As a mediator of opposite qualities, Strength is not dissimilar to card II, The High Priestess, who stands between earth and the spirit world; V, The Hierophant, who intercedes between heaven and earth; and VII, The Chariot, who precedes her in the major arcana sequence, in which the charioteer reins in the light and dark aspects of the self. Although apparent rivals, these opposites derive from one source and, like the yin-yang symbol, are in essence each other. Armed with Strength's experience, card IX, The Hermit, is bold enough to go into the wilderness alone to find himself intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.
Strength's number, VIII, stands for stability and renewal and was first assigned to the card by the Golden Dawn card correspondences. In earlier tarots, she was numbered XI, or the digits 11, for duality, and so links to II, The High Priestess. Strength as VIII is numerologically linked with card XVII, The Star (17, as 1 + 7 = 8). This too is a card of hope and high intention.
### STRENGTH'S ASTROLOGY
Strength's zodiac sign is Leo the Lion (July 24-August 23), a natural alignment as the lion is shown on the card. The card's element is dynamic Fire, linked with energy and enterprise.
### STRENGTH AND KABBALA
Strength's kabbalistic letter is Teth, meaning courage, as well as serpent or snake, referencing the wisdom of experience. The astrological glyph for Strength's sign of Leo resembles a snake. On the Tree of Life, Strength is placed on the ninth pathway between the spheres of Geburah and Chesed, meaning power linked with universal love and order. In Strength, we maintain order, despite the potential for chaos.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
Strength shows that you turn to your higher self for self-guidance; she also demonstrates strength of character when dealing with pressure. Courage, determination, and patience are needed now, as it is time to get a situation-or individual-under control. You will need to act with grace and sensitivity, however, rather than using brute force. This is a good card for leadership, as it signifies you are ready to take on a challenge and stand firm; others may resist, but be consistent in your actions and results will come. In creative projects, Strength shows you taking a raw idea and developing it. You refine it without sacrificing its spirit or depleting your energy. This concept may take physical form as a document, piece of artwork, or prototype.
On a psychological level, Strength shows the integration of masculine and feminine traits and finding balance between the two. In terms of health, Strength shows resilience and vitality, recovery from illness, and the willpower to break bad habits.
Here are some specifics:
* **Home:** There's a need to support and direct those with strong opinions. You may need to take the role of mediator.
* **Relationships:** The need for balance-there is a danger that physical attraction masks emotional or other commitment issues that need to be addressed. This card is also a message of hope if your relationship has been tested, as the situation will soon improve.
* **Career and money:** Tension at work-Resolution comes gently and without force.
### HER WISDOM MESSAGE
With strength, you can discover your higher purpose.
### STRENGTH'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, Strength appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The lemniscate, or infinity symbol: Balance, activity, and renewal-The flow of this never-ending symbol also suggests consistency and patience. The eight-shape mirrors VIII, Strength's number.
See this symbol on card I, The Magician.
* The lion: The lion is a universal symbol of power, courage, majesty, and leadership. In alchemy, the lion stands for base matters that can be turned into gold, as well as enlightenment.
See this symbol on card X, The Wheel of Fortune, and XXI, The World.
* The garland of roses/rose briar: Civility, celebration, and protection
See this symbol on cards I, The Magician; the Queen of Pentacles; and the Four of Wands.
* The white robe: A symbol of purity
See this symbol on cards II, The High Priestess, and XIII, Death.
* Yellow background: Consciousness, clear sight and support-applying strength, being courageous, is a conscious action
See this symbol on cards I, The Magician; III, The Empress; VII, The Chariot; and XI, Justice.
### HISTORICAL STRENGTH: THE LIONKILLERS
The image of woman or man and a lion is embedded in many of humanity's myths and legends. Some are stories of healing, such as the fairytale beauty and the beast. Another example is the classical fable of Androcles, a fugitive slave who heals the paw of a wounded lion. Androcles is later recaptured and condemned to public death by mauling by a lion. Yet the lion Androcles faces in the stadium is his old friend, who recognizes Androcles and refuses to kill him. The slave is given his freedom by the Emperor of Rome, and man and lion parade the streets together in celebration. Flowers are strewn upon them-echoed, perhaps, in the rose garlands shown on our Rider-Waite Strength card.
In other myths, taking on the lion shows our power over nature. The huntress Cyrene, the ""girl lionkiller"" according to Greek poet Nonnus, killed many a beast to protect her father's cattle; her exploits caught the attention of the god Apollo, who fell in love with her. The Visconti-Sforza tarots of the Renaissance show Hercules with a raised club, defeating the terrifying lion of Nemea. He brought the animal's skin back to King Eurystheus, and with this trophy proved he had succeeded in his first labor.
The Griggoneur tarot cards of the mid-fifteenth century include an unusual Strength card: a courtly lady sitting comfortably holding a broken pillar. It's unclear if she is supporting the two pieces, stopping them from falling, or actually breaking the pillar. This image may relate to Samson's destruction of the temple of the Philistines or the legend of the Pillars of Hercules, which, according to Plato, guarded the entry to the mysterious lost world of Atlantis. This was the border of civilization, so this lady and her pillar may symbolize the defense of boundaries. She is literally a pillar of strength.
In the Tarot of Marseilles (1701-1715), we see a woman restraining the lion's jaws and wearing a wide floppy hat-the brim makes the shape of the leminscate, or infinity symbol, shown also on the Rider-Waite card (see Strength's Symbols).
### STRENGTH'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of Strength in these minor arcana cards:
* The Seven of Wands, for endurance
* The Nine of Wands, for relentless effort
* The Ace of Swords, for decisiveness
* The Eight of Pentacles, for commitment
### TRY A READING WITH STRENGTH: A TEST OF COURAGE
Take Strength from your deck and lay the card before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose five cards with your left hand and place them around Strength, as shown. You could ask, ""What should I hold on to?"" or ""What could I let go of?"" To hold or release-both actions require courage.

* **Card 2:** You in this situation
* **Card 3:** What to hold on to

ultimate_tarot_chapter_4_the_hermit,ultimate_tarot,chapter_4,"## IX THE HERMIT
!THE HERMIT.
Alternative Names: The Old Man, Time, The Poor Man
Number: IX
Numerology Link: XVII, The Moon
Astrological Sign or Planet: Virgo the Virgin
Element: Earth
Hebrew Letter: Yod
Symbol: The hand
Meaning: Prudence
Tree of Life Pathway: Tenth, between Chesed and Tiphareth
Chakra: Heart seed, for soul remembrance
Key Meanings: Healing and self-exploration
### UNDERSTANDING THE HERMIT
The Hermit is a man all alone, old and bearded, with just his staff and lantern as his companions in a snowy wilderness. Inside his lantern is a glowing star, a symbol of guidance that lights his way ahead. The Hermit needs privacy, time for silence and discretion, so he can think and plan. He may be in the wilderness, but this space is essential to him. In this way, the Hermit tells us it is time to go it alone, to break with convention and find our soul's path.
In the major arcana sequence, the Hermit appears after VIII, Strength, and before X, The Wheel of Fortune. Having learned the lessons of Strength, he takes time out to contemplate his experiences. The Hermit can be seen as the Fool grown, the youth now as an old man, and his arrival marks the near-end of the first half of the tarot journey marked by X, The Wheel of Fortune. In the second half of the major arcana cycle, the material world fades and the spiritual quest beckons.
The Hermit's number is IX, or three groups of dynamic three. The Hermit needs time to integrate his experience in mind, body, and soul. Nine is also the last single-digit number in the major arcana sequence and a pause in activity before he aligns with fate, symbolized by the Wheel of Fortune. The Hermit is numerologically linked with card XVIII, The Moon (18; 1 + 8 = 9)-a card of imagination and self-reflection.
### THE HERMIT'S ASTROLOGY
The Hermit's zodiac sign is Virgo the Virgin. It suggests the Hermit has this attribute-perhaps he is a chaste monk. The Hermit's number, IX, gives us the ninth month of the year, September, and the sign of Virgo (August 23-September 22).
### THE HERMIT AND KABBALA
The kabbalistic letter of the Hermit is Yod, which means hand and also prudence. Yod is the foundation of all other letters in the Hebrew alphabet, just as the Hermit's retreat helps him establish his priorities.
On the Tree of Life, the Hermit is placed on the tenth pathway between Chesed and Tiphareth, or love and beauty aligned with salvation.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
There's an opportunity to take time away from routine to consider your options or advance a personal project. This card can show you enjoying solitude, as you need space to process your thoughts and feelings. The Hermit can show a physical journey, but more commonly he represents a state of mind in which you wisely withdraw and keep your own counsel. It can show breaking with tradition and finding a unique approach to a challenge. You may appreciate a mentor, and when you are ready, as the saying goes, the teacher will appear. Until that time, you have yourself to rely upon, and you do have the answers; all you need is the mental space to connect with your inner wisdom. If you are under pressure to make a decision, the Hermit shows you need more time.
There is also a healing aspect to the Hermit, and the card can appear in a reading to show self-healing and healing others. You may need to guide others and show them the way forward. Even if you are not entirely sure you can help, you are equipped to do so.
The Hermit can also indicate the following:
* **Home:** Consider all your options carefully and avoid making big decisions at present. Prioritize your tasks and focus on planning rather than immediate action.
* **Relationships:** Take time to invest in your current relationship or to work on your relationship with yourself. The card can also show a period of being single.
* **Career and money:** Take a different approach and stand back. You may be drawn to research and professional development courses now. A mentor may guide you.
### HIS WISDOM MESSAGE
Live quietly for a time.
### THE HERMIT'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Hermit appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The staff: The staff symbolizes self-support. In some decks, the staff is entwined by a snake, making a single spiral to form the Rod of Asclepius, a signifier for the Greek deity of healing.
* The lantern: A sign of the divine light within that illuminates our life path
* The six-pointed star: The star is a mark of hope and guidance. Its six points comprise two triangles-heaven and earth, or man and God, in unity. It is also a symbol of Saturn, god of agriculture and time, the Hermit's ancestor (see The Historical Hermit). See this symbol on card XVII, The Star, and III, The Empress.
* The old man: The archetype of wisdom, the old man's beard, hood, and downward gaze symbolize retreat and discretion.
### THE HISTORICAL HERMIT: FATHER TIME
On the Renaissance Visconti-Sforza tarots, the Hermit is entitled ""The Old Man."" On these and similar cards of that era, the hermit holds an hourglass in the traditional shape of the infinity symbol or lemniscate, illustrating the Hermit's alternate name, Time. By the eighteenth century, however, the Hermit's hourglass had become a lantern-a possible misinterpretation by later artists.
The Hermit is depicted differently in many cards. He is shown in cards of the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as an old man on crutches. In the Tarocchi of Mitelli (c. 1664) he has angel wings, suggesting he is facing death. On eighteenth-century minchiate cards, he is on crutches by a tomb with an hourglass, pierced by time's arrow. Beside him is a stag, a Christ symbol. And later, by the twentieth century, we see the Hermit's staff entwined with a snake in the shape of the Rod of Ascelpius, a symbol of the Greek god of healing.
There is also evidence that the Hermit was associated with the Roman god Saturn (rather than Mercury, ruler of his sign of Virgo). Saturn was an aspect of the Titan god Chronos, who ate his own children because he believed the prophesy that one of them would overthrow him-a grisly way to stop the passage of time. In the Tarocchi of Mantegna (c. 1470), card 47 is Saturno, a bearded man with a staff, just like our traditional Hermit.
The Hermit may also embody the tarot's hidden virtue card of Prudence. It seems most likely that Prudence survived in modern decks as Justice (see page 79) or possibly the Hanged Man (page 78), but the Hermit may have first crept into the tarot in the Prudence card of the Tarocchi of Mantegna, a deck of fifty instructional cards that may be Florentine or Venetian in origin and date from around 1470. Prudence shows both an old bearded man and a young woman with a mirror and a dragon (which may have morphed into the snake shown on the Hermit on contemporary decks). The virtue of Prudence has survived in the meaning of the Hermit in his Hebrew letter, Yod, and in his meaning of discretion and careful planning.
### THE HERMIT'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Hermit in these minor arcana cards:
* The Seven of Wands, for standing alone and advocating your beliefs
* The Nine of Wands, for the need for protection
* The Nine of Pentacles, for independence and resourcefulness
* The Queen of Swords, for independence

---","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, you may be feeling alone and unsupported. However, this is more an attitude than reality, so it's worth asking yourself if you are avoiding help. The card can also show accepting a role—perhaps victim or martyr—that you find hard to let go of due to habit or stubbornness. Alternatively, the card can show a time when you are cut off from your usual support systems or have been unfriended by those you trusted. If this chimes for you, go with the upright card meaning and withdraw for a while, relying on your own guidance.",The Hermit,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1620,9176

Astrological Sign or Planet: Jupiter
Element: Fire
Hebrew Letter: Kaph
Symbol: The palms of the hand, or cup

Tree of Life Pathway: Eleventh, between Chesed and Netzach

### UNDERSTANDING THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE
Flanked by three animals and a winged figure, the Wheel appears between the clouds in blue sky, symbolizing hope, clarity, and a breakthrough on a spiritual path. With The Wheel in motion is destiny at work: Divine law rules.
In the major arcana sequence, the Wheel of Fortune as card X marks the halfway point in our tarot journey. We now turn from the outward-looking phase, which focuses on our relationship with the external world, to another phase that begins our inner, spiritual journey. We learn the lesson of Justice, are transformed by Death, meet the Angel of Temperance, and then encounter the Devil and the Tower of destruction. After all this, we ascend to the cosmos with the Star, Moon, and Sun, look back on our lives with Judgment, and celebrate our achievements with the World before returning to begin all over again with card 0, The Fool.
The Wheel has a numerological link with card I, The Magician (10 reduces to 1), and card XIX, The Sun, (19; 1 + 9 = 10). Read together, these three cards assume the ritual of a spell or cosmic order: We set a singular intention with the Magician, align our wishes with the Wheel of Fortune, and enjoy the outcome with the Sun.
### HE WHEEL OF FORTUNE'S ASTROLOGY
The Wheel corresponds to Jupiter, planet of luck, which rules religions and ideology, research and exploration. The angel and three animals around the wheel, embodied in the sphinx, can also be connected with the four elements and the fixed zodiac signs of Aquarius (the angel, element of Air), Taurus (bull, Earth), Scorpio (eagle, Water), and Leo (lion, Fire): They are shown on the Wheel as the primal elements of life.
### THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE AND KABBALA
The Hebrew letter of the Wheel is Kaph, which means the palms of the hand and also destiny. On early tarot cards, a youth at the top of the Wheel is shown with one cupped hand.
On the Tree of Life, the Wheel is placed on the eleventh pathway between the spheres of Chesed, for law and love, and Netzach, for the forces of nature.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
When the Wheel is upright, anything is possible-and usually positive. Chance meetings, unexpected offers, and news arrive in force. If life has been difficult recently, the Wheel shows a turn for the better. Under this influence, your intuitive powers heighten, and you may find yourself tuning in to people from the past-who magically reappear. This is also an auspicious card for communication with family and friends who live some distance away. Additionally, the Wheel reveals psychic ability, either within you or someone close, and a chance to discover all your hidden aspects-both light and dark. You can use the Wheel's positive message wisely now to listen to your intuition and also to manifest your wishes, as your energy aligns with your guides, angels, and other spirit helpers who help you on your path. Your quest for knowledge is heightened now and, while you cannot control the forces of the universe, you can certainly come to a better understanding of your role within the universe.
The Wheel also suggests the following:
* **Home:** An unexpected change in your living arrangements will happen; it will be surprising but beneficial in the long term.
* **Relationships:** An ex-partner or love interest comes back, but you will need to decide if this time your relationship will succeed. Don't try to make it work; if it is right, love will go smoothly.
* **Career and money:** News is coming that will improve your situation. However, you will need to prioritize the demands upon yourself and quickly adapt to new challenges.
### ITS WISDOM MESSAGE
Surrender to fate.
### THE WHEEL'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Wheel of Fortune appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The wheel and its inscription: In ancient Egypt, the wheel was a symbol of the sun. The wheel is inscribed with the letters t, a, r, and o, which can be arranged as rota, Latin for wheel. The t, a, r, and o can also be arranged as Tora, the visible letters on the scroll of the High Priestess. See this inscription on card II, The High Priestess.
* The wheel's alchemical symbols: The four symbols on the wheel spokes are Mercury, at the top, sulfur on the right, water below, and salt to the left. Mercury, sulfur, and salt were believed to be the secret ingredients used to create the mystical philosopher's stone.
* The wheel's Hebrew letters: These form the tetragrammaton: the four letters Y, H, V, H, or Yahweh-the name of God in Judaism.
* The sphinx: Meaning unity in diversity, the creature is traditionally composed of a human face (the angel), the body of a lion, the tail of a bull, and the wings of an eagle (the eagle is represented on the sphinx with a sword rather than wings). The four beings the sphinx embodies are illustrated around the Wheel, which also relate to the four fixed zodiac signs (see The Wheel of Fortune's Astrology). See this symbol on card VII, The Chariot.
* The snake: According to A. E. Waite, the snake is the legendary serpent-monster Typhon. He appears on the card with his head downward to show the negative aspect of fate. See this symbol on card I, The Magician, and VI, The Lovers.
* The god Anubis: Anubis is the jackal-headed Egyptian god of the afterlife and overseer of the rites of mummification. Placed on the lower right-hand side of the wheel with his head upright, we sense he travels all the way around the wheel, through life, death, and rebirth, echoing his role as protector of the dead.
The angel and three animals: The angel, the lion, the bull, and the eagle are the symbols of the four evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John-associated with the Four Gospels of the New Testament. They also symbolize the four elements and, by association, the four suits of the minor arcana. See these symbols on card XXI, The World.
### THE HISTORICAL WHEEL OF FORTUNE: THE FOOL AND THE HERMIT
The Wheel of Fortune was a common motif of fickle fate in medieval times. The *Carmina Burana*, a manuscript of 254 poems dating from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, later set to music by Carl Orff, contains an illustration of a wheel almost identical in composition to that shown in the very first tarot cards of the Renaissance era.
On the Visconti-Sforza card's Wheel of Fortune, a regal youth sits on a platform above the wheel. The youth has ass's ears, like early renditions of the Fool (see page 30). A bearded old man-the Hermit-is crouched under the Wheel. As with the *Carmina Burana*'s wheel, there is annotation for each of the four figures around the wheel. Words appear on the Visconti-Sforza card that translate as ""I shall reign,"" ""I am reigning,"" ""I have reigned,"" and ""I am without reign.""

When the Wheel is reversed, you may suffer some bad luck, but thankfully this marks the end of a run of challenges. In this way, the simple interpretation of the reversed Wheel is closure. The benefits of the upright Wheel will come—it will just take a little longer to gather momentum and move you forward.

### UNDERSTANDING JUSTICE
Justice is one of the simplest cards to understand at first glance. A female figure is seated between two pillars on a ceremonial podium. This is the judge, or the virtue Justice personified, holding the traditional symbols of the law-an upright sword in her right hand and the scales in her left. Clad in the red robes of office, her right foot is forward and her pose is alert, as if she is about to pronounce judgment in court. Unlike traditional justice figures, tarot's Justice is not blindfolded. Her vision is clear.
The card favors those who are deserving (shown by the scales of mercy), but seeks retribution for past wrongs (symbolized by the sword of retribution). Justice is delivered through logical procedures and is focused on the mind rather than the emotions-just like the suit of Swords in the minor arcana (see page 176). However, there is, perhaps, more to Justice than meets the eye. Although Justice wears red, symbolizing the material world she lives in, the card's background is yellow, for enlightenment, suggesting the guidance of a higher, divine power. The card design, with a central figure between two pillars, is intentionally similar to those of V, The Hierophant, and II, The High Priestess, suggesting duality and knowledge.
Justice is one of the four cardinal, or essential, virtue cards of the tarot. The others are Strength, Temperance, and Prudence. The original Prudence card of early tarots has disappeared, but its meaning may be preserved in Justice. An old interpretation of prudence is wisdom, rather than caution-for example, in the conjunct word jurisprudence, the theory and study of law.
The number of Justice is XI. If XI is expressed as 11, we have two numbers with the same value, symbolizing balance and fairness. II is also the number of the High Priestess, Justice's numerological partner.
In traditional decks of the nineteenth century and earlier, Justice usually swapped places with Strength, number VIII. The VIII also suggests balance, as it comprises two sets of four, which is the number of stability.
### JUSTICE'S ASTROLOGY
Justice takes the sign of Libra the Scales (September 22-October 23), which begins at the autumn equinox when the hours of daylight and darkness are equal, reflected in Libra's symbol, the scales. Justice's element, Air, also reminds us of the scales, which hang midair.
### JUSTICE AND KABBALA
Lamed is the twelfth letter of the Hebrew alphabet and falls halfway within the sequence of twenty-two letters. Lamed means to whip or to goad-to assert authority; its esoteric meaning is fairness. On the Tree of Life, Justice is placed on the thirtieth pathway between the spheres of Tiphareth, for beauty and consciousness, and Geburah, or power. In this way, the card's kabbalistic association suggests power, perfectly wielded.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
There will be a positive outcome. This is a time when past errors or imbalances can be redressed. You benefit from a fair system, provided you are accountable, honest, and deserving. Equally, you may be the judge in your own life, using your perspective and integrity to make good decisions that will safeguard your future. You may take a moral stand on an issue that affects you and those around you. In legal matters, a decision is made or a ruling given, which goes in your favor; justice will be done and order restored. On a spiritual level, Justice shows the working out of karma, or actions and consequences.
Justice shows a logical, considered influence. It is a welcome arrival in your reading if life has felt chaotic. It is a card of empowerment, advising you to take a left-brain approach to take control. Influential people favor you now, and your projects get support. Listen to advice from people around you whom you respect. Justice can also indicate the following:
* **Home:** Legal issues concerning property are resolved. Contracts are signed and you can make progress.
* **Relationships:** While balance and practical issues are important now, take care that your emotional needs are met. Find the right balance between work and relationships.
* **Career and money:** At work you may be tested, but the outcome is positive; job interviews and negotiations are successful. Financially, you are coming to the end of a frugal period-money matters are set to improve.
### HER WISDOM MESSAGE
With the right values, reward comes.
### JUSTICE'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, Justice appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The stone pillars: Boundaries and permanence-Justice's ruling is given within the boundaries of the law.
See this symbol on card II, The High Priestess; V, The Hierophant; and VII, The Chariot.
* The sword: The sword shows the action that results from judgment. Like the Ace of Swords, it is held upright (see page 176) and signifies success.
See this symbol on the Suit of Swords; X, The Wheel of Fortune; and I, The Magician.
* The scales: The scales represent the thought process involved in making a judgment-in that both sides of a story must be weighed up. The weight in the center of the scales resembles a ring through a sword, an ancient Celtic symbol of justice.
* The crown: An authority symbol, Justice's crown is known as a mural crown. Crenelated like castle walls, it suggests that justice is part of a civilized society. The square jewel in its center represents order.
* The veil: This appears to be a darkish red on the Rider-Waite card and is often shown as violet in later Rider interpretations. Some say this violet symbolizes spirituality, but consider it first as a soft boundary between the judge's court and the everyday world-when a ruling has been given, the veil is dropped and words become action.
See this symbol on card II, The High Priestess, as a sign of the spirit world beyond her chamber.
Yellow background: Consciousness, clear sight, and support
See this symbol on I, The Magician; III, The Empress; VII, The Chariot; and VIII, Strength.
### HISTORICAL JUSTICE: THE WISDOM OF ASTREA AND MA'AT
The figure of justice so familiar to the courthouse derives from the ancient Greek goddess Astrea (the Roman Justitia), daughter of Themis. Both Astea and Themis were personifications of justice in the classical world. In statues depicting them, they raise the scales of justice and point the sword downward, and the goddesses were usually shown without blindfolds. Historically, there are few variations on the card design. The Visconti-Sforza Justice cards, painted in fifteenth-and sixteenth-century Italy, show the likely figure of Maria Bianca Visconti (see page 40) with her scales and upright sword. However, a knight in black armor on a white charger is jumping over the throne, perhaps implying the result or action of her ruling; there may be a resonance with the horseman in the Death card (see page 82). In the Classic Tarot, a reproduction of a Milanese tarot from around 1835, Justice has wings, echoing Ma'at, the ancient Egyptian goddess of cosmic wisdom and one of the earliest winged figures we have evidence of in art. Ma'at's influence is also suggested in card XX, Judgment. As Ma'at weighed the souls of the dead, in Judgment we evaluate our own soul (see page 110).
### JUSTICE'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of Justice in these minor arcana cards:
* The Ace of Swords, for clarity of thought and success
* The Two of Swords, which shows two swords, means a stalemate; a pending decision
### TRY A READING WITH JUSTICE: THE BALANCE OF POWER
Take Justice from your deck and lay the card before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose four cards with your left hand and place them around Justice, as shown. You could ask, ""How do I make this decision?"" or, as a prediction, ""Will a decision go in my favor?""

### UNDERSTANDING THE HANGED MAN
This card, with its strange image of a man suspended from a tree, seems deadly by name. Yet when we examine the man's face, he appears perfectly calm-content, even, regardless of his precarious situation. He hangs by one leg yet his expression is beatific, and he has been given a halo. What exactly is going on?
The Hanged Man is on a tree rather than a hangman's scaffold, and the tree is the Tree of Life, symbol of the world at an esoteric level. This tree is in bud and alive with future possibility. The Hanged Man also appears safely tethered, and it's as if he knows he cannot fall. Suspended in midair, he is content to wait out his fate.
The Hanged Man has numerous possible identities (see The Historical Hanged Man); he may even be Christ himself-we have a halo and a kind of cross, after all. In the Paris Eadwine Psalter, which dates from the twelfth century, Christ is shown upside down on a cross, attended to by angels and two men binding his wrists. This may relate one of the card's meanings, which is sacrifice. The T-shaped cross is also a symbol of salvation and indicated those who suffered through the crucifixion of Christ. It is natural to connect at first with the otherworldly situation of the Hanged Man in his happy suspension, rather than his identity. The Hanged Man is not about to die. Rather, he is hanging around until his circumstances change.
In the major arcana sequence, the Hanged Man falls after XI, Justice, and before XIII, Death. We had our values on trial in Justice, and now we must hold on until Death, when we can figuratively let go. Death brings transformation, while the Hanged Man prepares to make the sacrifice Death needs so he can move on. This may sound rather grim, but Death is ongoing change and transformation, and any big shift requires preparation-and in some cases, the waiting time that the Hanged Man represents.
The Hanged Man's number, XII, comprises 1 and 2, adding up to III for the Empress. Both cards are about incubation: The Hanged Man's waiting is a spiritual incubation, relating to the legend of Odin (see The Hanged Man's Symbols), whereas the Empress's equivalent is the gestation time for her babies (see III, The Empress, page 42).
### THE HANGED MAN'S ASTROLOGY
Neptune is the planet of the Hanged Man. Ruler of the oceans, Neptune links with the element of the card, Water. Also associated with mystical states and the imagination, Neptune indicates the different facets of the card when reversed- the aspect of fantasy and the raised state of consciousness that a period of reflection can bring
### THE HANGED MAN AND KABBALA
The Hebrew letter of the Hanged Man is Mem, which means the oceans as well as transition. On the Tree of Life, the Hanged Man is placed on the thirteenth pathway between the spheres of Hod and Geburah, or the logical mind versus power. Hod is also concerned with creativity and insight while Geburah has a violent, destructive aspect. The hanged man is suspended between these two energies, and perhaps he must use his clever mind to balance his frustration as he exists in limbo.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The obvious meaning of the card at first glance is hanging around: Events are not moving with speed, but all you can do is wait patiently in the knowledge that the universe has its own plan. The card can also indicate that you may have made sacrifices just now and are eager to see rewards. Unfortunately, you cannot force an outcome that fits with your timetable. There are many other factors about which you can have no knowledge or influence. Therefore, you may also expect delays to travel plans and projects. On a creative level, this card can appear frequently when a person is feeling frustrated with their progress. However, the message of the Hanged Man is incubation-your project needs time to evolve. Use this time to develop perspective on your work and your ambitions.
Another message from the Hanged Man is to try to see things from a new angle. If your approach isn't working, ask yourself if you can think laterally or find a way to turn a situation around.
The Hanged Man can also suggest the following:
* **Home:** Waiting and delays may affect remodeling or house moves. Try to invest your time wisely while you wait-there may be a creative solution.
* **Relationships:** You are unable to get the commitment you need from a partner, or you may be the one unwilling to commit. Traditionally, it can also show hanging around for a lover to acknowledge you as a partner rather than friend. If youre waiting too long, you may decide its not worth the emotional investment.
* Career and money: Hold back on signing contracts or dealing with legal matters just now. With work, decisions may be going on that will affect your position, but you are protected. If you are looking for work, there may be delays and frustration.
### HIS WISDOM MESSAGE
Use your time wisely.
### THE HANGED MAN'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Hanged Man appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The Tree: This represents the World Tree that the Norse god Odin hung from and the Tree of Life, central motif of the Kabbala, the Judaic mystical belief system.
* The Tree as the Tau Cross: Tau is the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet and refers to the shape of a cross, a T-shape, upon which Christ was crucified.
* The figure: According to A. E. Waite, the figure's right bent leg suggests part of the shape of the fylfot cross, an early Christian symbol.
* The halo: A symbol of enlightenment and a spiritual signifier, around the Hanged Man, the halo is also a symbol of protection.
See this Symbol on card XIV, Temperance, crowning Archangel Michael.
### THE HISTORICAL HANGED MAN: SOLDIER OF FORTUNE
The historical Hanged Man may be Muzio Attendolo Sforza, an Italian condottiere or mercenary connected with the Visconti family, who commissioned the early tarot decks (see page 10). Attendolo killed the tyrant Ottobuono Terzo, an opponent of the Pope, but claimed that Pope John had not paid him for his services, so he defected to fight for King Ladislaus of Naples. According to scholar Geoffrey Trease, the Pope was so incensed by Attendolo's turnabout that he commissioned a satirical illustration showing him as a traitorous hanged man, which the tarot illustration references.
Another possible inspiration for the Hanged Man is the Norse God Odin, who hung from the World Ash tree for nine days and nights and at the end of his ordeal was granted the gift of prophecy. The eighteenth-century occultist Court de Gébelin suggested that the Hanged Man may actually be a printer's error, and that the card was intended to be the other way up. Upright, it resembles a French tarot of around 1720 with a Prudence card showing the Hanged Man's pose, upright with one knee bent. However, given the earliest Hanged Man cards were hand-painted, it's more likely that the figure is correctly positioned-and that the original Hanged Man was actually Muzio Attendolo Sforza.
### THE HANGED MAN'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Hanged Man in these minor arcana cards:
* The Eight of Wands reversed, for delay with moving and communication
* The Two of Wands reversed, for delays to plans
* The Three of Wands reversed, for delays to travel
### TRY A READING WITH THE HANGED MAN: AN ALTERED PERSPECTIVE
Take the Hanged Man from your deck and lay him before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose five cards with your left hand and place them as shown. You could ask, ""What am I waiting for?"" or ""What supports me at this time?""
* **Card 1:** Your situation
* **Card 2:** What supports you emotionally
* **Card 3:** What supports you practically
* **Card 4:** An alternative view of the situation

The Hanged Man reversed can be a sign of rigid thinking and martyrdom. You may need to revise your expectations; what you think you want may not be possible.

### UNDERSTANDING DEATH
Death's image is unmistakable. Unlike the Hanged Man-a common motif in the fifteenth century but a puzzle to us today-Death's grim reaper is eternally understood as an immutable part of our earthly existence. Triumphant with his scythe and hood, sometimes riding a horse, skeletal Death is a reminder of our human frailty. Yet Death is also the bringer of necessary change and is not a sign of the physical death of a person in the present or future. He heralds the end of an era, when what is not needed is taken so the next phase can begin. Without him, we could have no clear sight of what might be possible. Death as the reaper brings in the harvest, which is shown by the five ears of corn on his standard, or flag. Whatever is worth having will be saved, but what is irrelevant will be taken. On the Rider-Waite card, Death's influence affects all people regardless of status, shown by the people on the card at various stages of death or surrender, from the bishop to the child, the king to the maiden. This is the medieval Dance of Death, a common subject in paintings of that era. His black armor and pale horse follow the description of Death, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse described in the New Testament's Book of Revelation.
In the major arcana sequence, Death arrives after card XII, The Hanged Man, a logical progression in that death must be the consequence of hanging, but this is spiritual death and rebirth after a time of contemplation. The card that follows Death is Temperance, when we begin to assimilate our past, present, and future to come to a greater understanding of our potential.
Death's number, XIII, is traditionally unlucky, but in numerology it reduces to 4 (1 + 3 = 4)-or IV, The Emperor, which promises that a new order will come after Death has cleared the way. A sun silhouettes the city: This is both sunset and sunrise, or simultaneous endings and beginnings.
### DEATH'S ASTROLOGY
Scorpio is named after the scorpion, which kills with a swift sting-and, unsurprisingly, it is the astrological sign associated with Death. Its dates (October 23-November 22) mark the period after the harvest when leaves fall and we stock up for the winter. Scorpio is associated with death and sex, dying and creation, just as Death brings an ending before fertile new life with the spring.
### DEATH AND KABBALA
The Hebrew letter associated with Death is Nun, which means fish, a symbol of sexuality and sperm; in climax this is le petit mort, the Little Death, which leads us to Nun's connotations of decline and rebirth. On the Tree of Life, Death is placed on the fourteenth pathway, between the spheres of Netzach and Tiphareth, or the cycles of nature-rebirth and growth.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
Death brings endings and beginnings-sometimes all at once. This a time of fast and deep transformation and an opportunity to let go of whatever you no longer need. Unlike card XX, Judgment, which signals a process of self-examination, Death's impact is sudden and may be shocking. You have little control over external events when Death looms, but in time you will be able to see this sharp change in circumstances as a blessing. A break with the past-from relationships and friendships to work that is no longer satisfying-is the only way forward. In this sense, Death can be a release and a relief. Death, after all, is the ultimate reality check, and he leaves you with the bare bones, the truth.
In certain areas of life, Death can signify the following:
* **Home:** You need to find a new home; the place you are living no longer meets your needs. New circumstances may offer an opportunity to relocate.
* **Relationships:** A relationship ends or there is a period of necessary separation. In friendships, there will be an opportunity to reconnect when the time is right.
* **Career and money:** Signifying a career change or the ending of business partnerships or ways of bringing in an income, Death also suggests new opportunities are on the horizon. Financially, this is a tough time, but money matters will improve, so hold tight.
### ITS WISDOM MESSAGE
Swift change brings new beginnings.
### DEATH'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, Death appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The standard: The standard, or flag, shows a white rose and five ears of corn. The rose symbolizes renewal and the corn, the harvest. Death takes his harvest of souls and leaves the grain-the truth of his decision.
See the flag of St. George on card XX, Judgment.
* The black armor: Black symbolizes loss and endings. Death is protected by his armor, whereas his chosen ones have no protection from his scythe.
* The pale horse: The pale horse of Death, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, links the Death card with Judgment: The four horsemen bring an apocalypse upon the world before the Last Judgment.
* The red feather: Symbolizing the life force, here it is shown wilted and dying. See this symbol as a positive on cards 0, The Fool, and XIX, The Sun.
* The bishop and child: The innocent child and godly bishop are both shown in yellow to symbolize their piety. They look directly at the figure of Death, their purity protecting them from fear, while the other victims turn away.
* The city gates: Death's rampage takes place outside the city walls because, traditionally, burial grounds were established away from cities for hygiene reasons. On the card, the city gates represent the gates of heaven. The sun rising and/or setting shows the dawn of a new era and the closing of a present era.
See this symbol on card XVIII, The Moon.
* The ship: The boat or ship is a signifier in many ancient beliefs for the journey the soul takes to the afterlife. The riverbed is marshlike and suggests the Styx, the mythological Greek river over which the souls of the dead were carried to the underworld; this also links to Death's element of Water. In Christianity, the boat is an old symbol for Christ and the church.
### HISTORICAL DEATH: DANSE MACABRE
The Visconti di Modrone tarot (1441-1447) shows Death on horseback with a bandage around his head, wielding a huge scythe-very like our Rider-Waite card, as it too shows a bishop or king and children, all about to succumb. In the Visconti-Sforza tarots, Death is a skeletal archer who holds a vertebra in the shape of an archer's bow. The clear message is that death, just like love, strikes at random. The Black Death, famine, and the Hundred Years War in Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries made death a very common part of life in medieval times, and paintings showing Death were a common reminder of our frailty: Painter and printmaker Pieter Bruegel the Elder's 1562 *The Triumph of Death* depicts a Dance of Death, or Danse Macabre, showing Death as an animated skeleton slaying people from all walks of life, again, like the randomness shown in the Rider-Waite card. Later, Death's dance became a subject for satire, and Death became an almost comic figure, leading unwilling and random citizens to their demise.
### DEATH'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Death card in these minor arcana cards:
* The Ten of Swords, for endings
* The Four Aces, for beginnings
### TRY A READING WITH DEATH: LOOKING AT TRANSFORMATION
If you are uncomfortable with the Death card, focus on the meaning of transition and change-and get comfortable with the image. Take Death from your deck and lay him before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards, and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose two cards with your left hand and place them as shown. You could ask, ""What needs to go?"" or ""What will be transformed?""
* Card 1: Past issues: what is to be released
* Card 2: The outcome

---","### REVERSED MEANING

Death reversed has virtually the same meaning as the card in the upright position, but the difference is in your reaction. You may feel anxious and stressed, unable to comprehend what is happening, rather than being accepting. When Death is reversed, the universe is telling you that there is no way back—a relationship	cannot	be	mended,	or	an	employer	won’t	change	their	mind.	If	you do	a	second	reading	and	ask	the	question	again,	this	card	can	appear	after	you have	already	had	Death	upright,	as	a	final	confirmation	of	your	question",Death,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1499,8742

Astrological Sign or Planet: Sagittarius the Archer
Element: Fire
Hebrew Letter: Samekh
Symbol: Support or crutch
Meaning: Patience
Tree of Life Pathway: Fifteenth, between Yesod and Tiphareth
Chakra: Solar plexus, for personal power
Key Meanings: Moderation, reconciliation, healing, and angelic guidance
### UNDERSTANDING TEMPERANCE
An angel holds two cups flowing with water. He has one foot on a rock and the other in the pool of water, showing the present, conscious mind (the rock, or earth), and the past, emotions and the unconscious mind (water). A clear path runs from the pool through two mountains and toward a potential future: a luminous rising sun. A new horizon or perspective is in sight. The riverbank is lush and verdant, and two yellow irises bloom there, symbols of hope. The angel, by moderating the flow of water in his cups, creates a harmonious flow, a new reality.
In the major arcana sequence, the angel of Temperance sits between card XIII, Death, and XV, The Devil; it is the antithesis of Death's loss and the Devil's enslavement to materialism and base urges. The angel is Archangel Michael, the protector warrior-angel, who offers us spiritual help and guidance while we strive to pacify or temper volatile forces. If we look closely, we see that the water from Michael's cups could be running upward or downward. Alchemy is at work, suggesting that a little magic may be needed if we are to reconcile all the demands upon us.
Temperance is one of the tarot's four virtues. Numerically between VI, The Lovers, and XX, Judgment, Temperance is also the second angel card in the major arcana sequence; it's a call to spiritual connection and service. This is shown by the symbol of the sun on Archangel Michael's forehead and the amulet on his chest (see Temperance's Symbols). Angels in the tarot are also connected with time. With Temperance, we are dealing with issues of the past, present, and future. With the Lovers, Archangel Raphael calls time on a present decision with future impact; with Judgment, Archangel Gabriel calls time on the past.
Temperance's number is XIV, the double of prime number 7, the magical number of creation. In numerology, the sum of XIV (14; 1+4=5) gives 5, or V, The Hierophant. The Hierophant's and Temperance's Archangel Michael is a divine meditator.
### TEMPERANCE'S ASTROLOGY
Sagittarius the Archer (November 23-December 21) is Temperance's sign. The archer is sometimes known as the centaur-half-man, half-beast-showing the blending of opposites. The glyph for Sagittarius is the crossed arrow, like that of the archer. It is a symbol of precision, just as Archangel Michael pours the water between goblets at a precise angle so no liquid is spilled. Temperances element is Fire, for action and energy
### TEMPERANCE AND KABBALA
The Hebrew letter associated with Temperance is Samekh, meaning support and patience. Temperance is placed on the Tree of Life on the fifteenth pathway, between the spheres of Yesod and Tiphareth, linking together the qualities of change and salvation.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
Temperance shows you dealing with a potentially volatile situation, and you need to temper your thoughts and actions to find balance and harmony. This means choosing neither one nor the other, but blending two opposing forces to create an inspired solution. The card also asks you not to resist, but to accept both sides of a situation and be guided by what feels most natural to you. It is time to reconcile any area of your life that is out of kilter. Be hands-on; you can analyze what you might do for eons, but what matters now is action.
Temperance also shows you are connecting with your guides and angels. You may be given a sign, such as advice from a friend or even a stranger whom the angels have sent to help you. This may also be the beginning of a spiritual journey for you. In your projects, what you imagine you can create. You may also be inspired by an invention or work of art from the past.
Here are some other interpretations:
* **Home:** Running a household and dealing with demanding children or partners is a fine balancing act, but you have the financial and emotional resources to succeed.
* **Relationships:** This is a stage in a relationship when you can reach a new level of trust. If you are single, you may be guided toward a new partner; it's an emotionally intense time.
* **Career and money:** You may be dealing with difficult or highly sensitive individuals. Be the diplomat, and you can work a miracle. In money terms, pay extra attention to your income and outgoings.
### ITS WISDOM MESSAGE
You are guided to find peace.
### TEMPERANCE'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, Temperance appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The triangle and square: The triangle within the square denotes the element of Fire (the upward-pointing triangle) and the Earth (the square). This, said A. E. Waite, is the symbol of the septenary-the seven principles of man according to nineteenth-century Theosophists. The seven principles are the physical body, the astral body, the breath, desire, thought, the spirit, and ""I am."" Above this amulet are the four Hebrew letters Y, H, V, and H, the tetragrammaton for the Lord or, when spoken, Yahweh.
* The cups: A cup represents the vessel of our experience. In Temperance, one cup is for the past and one is for the present, and the water running between the two symbolizes the present-what we create from the past and our future expectations. The cups also show focus on the task in hand.
* The sun symbol: The dotted circle on the archangel's head is the astrological symbol for the sun and spiritual illumination. It is also the alchemical symbol for gold.
See this symbol on card XIX, The Sun; 0, The Fool; and VI, The Lovers; as a halo, see card XII, The Hanged Man.
* Archangel Michael: Archangel Michael is the protector-archangel who deals
### with cutting through fear and letting go of the past.
See the Archangels Raphael and Gabriel on card VI, The Lovers, and XX, Judgment.
* The irises: The irises refer to Iris, the Greek goddess of rainbows and hope.
* The water-pool: The water symbolizes purification and regeneration in cultural practice and is also a signifier of the flow of emotions and unconscious mind.
See this symbol on card XVII, The Star, and XVIII, The Moon.
* Rising sun over mountain/volcano: Symbolizing renewal, it's a new dawn after a period of stress, shown by the mountains.
See the sun rising over the city on card XIII, Death.
### HISTORICAL TEMPERANCE: FINDING CHARITY
Temperance has few variations in its card design throughout history. Early tarot cards of the Renaissance show a woman without wings, and after the 1700s, the woman becomes an angel; the two cups, however, have always been present.
It's likely that Temperance embodies more than just one virtue. Prudence, Faith, Hope, and Charity are the ""lost"" cards of the tarot, which once appeared in variations of the Visconti-Sforza tarots of fifteenth-century Italy as well as earlier tarots. It's likely that Temperance became a natural home for Charity, as the Catholic catechism states, The virtue of chastity comes under the cardinal virtue of Temperance, which seeks to permeate the passions and appetites of the senses with reason.""
### TEMPERANCE'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of Temperance in these minor arcana cards:
* The Two of Coins, for weighing up a decision, or money flow
* The Six of Cups, for harmony
* The Page of Cups, for magical thinking
* The Queen of Cups, for nurturing a situation
* The Six of Pentacles, for fairness and generosity
### TRY A READING WITH TEMPERANCE: MAKING PEACE
Take Temperance from your deck and lay the card at the top of the spread as shown. Now split the deck into the minor and major arcana and shuffle each pile. Choose the first two cards from the minor arcana pile and lay them out as shown, then choose cards 3, 4, and 5 from the major arcana pile. You could ask, ""What do I need to temper?"" The suit element of the minor cards will show you which life area needs attention. The majors give you a deeper insight into how the situation may be transformed.

Hebrew Letter: Ayin
Symbol: Eye
Meaning: Clear vision
Tree of Life Pathway: Sixteenth, between Hod and Tiphareth
Chakra: Base for base instincts

### UNDERSTANDING THE DEVIL
A bearded man-beast sits above a door to which two demons, a man and woman, are chained. With an inverted pentacle rising from his third eye, he appears to be the epitome of evil, complete with horns, clawed feet, and batlike wings. He is half-man, half-goat, an archetype with roots in many ancient gods. He may be the faun Pan, god of excess; Satan, son of God gone bad; Baphomet, the dark idol the Knights Templar were accused of worshipping; or perhaps Cernunnos, the horned Pagan deity. All are attributed with great virility and sexual power.
The goat-god's abode is black, like a cave. We are in a dark place here, save for his fiery torch. His right hand raised asserts his control over the two small figures that stand before him. The couple is Adam and Eve, who, banished from paradise, find themselves enslaved and corrupted-they are becoming demons, shown by the tiny horns growing from their heads. Yet when we look closely, we can see that the chains around their necks are not at all tight; if they wished, they could walk away from the Devil altogether. The fruit near Eve reminds us of the Garden of Eden and the forbidden fruit. Adam's tail has a devilish fork, showing that these two have certainly given in to temptation.
In the major arcana sequence, the Devil falls between XIV, Temperance, and XVI, The Tower. If the lessons of Temperance are not learned, we fall from the grace of Temperance's angel and into the arms of the Devil. When we do finally turn our back on him, the lesson is profound. We must find a whole new way of living as the Tower-the ego-struck by lightning is destroyed.
The Devil's number, XV, reduces to card VI (1 + 5 = 6), or the Lovers. The Devil is the shadow side of the Lovers, fallen to materialism, greed, and lust. The Devil is also a symbol for other negative behavior patterns, such control, dangerous affairs, and addiction.
### THE DEVIL'S ASTROLOGY
The Devil's zodiac sign is Capricorn the Goat (December 22-January 20), linking with his identities as Pan and Satan. Capricorn's element is Earth, for material needs, and its planet is Saturn. Saturn was the Roman god of time. Time, like the Devil himself, is traditionally the ultimate enemy of man (see The Historical Devil).
### THE DEVIL AND KABBALA
The Devil's kabbalistic letter is Ayin, meaning eye, and also clear vision-a clue to be vigilant and all-seeing in the Devil's presence. On the Tree of Life, the card is placed on the sixteenth pathway between the spheres of Hod and Tiphareth. Hod stands for the mind and Tiphareth, beauty and rebirth, which shows us how our insight into a particular situation may just release us from the Devil's grip.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
You may be enslaved to an ideal or a relationship that demands too much. What started positively, or even pleasurably, has reversed, and now you are seeing a situation for what it is. This is a destructive situation, and you may be feeling controlled and under a bad influence. This is a card of greed, temptation, and materialism. Yet to change the situation, you will need to think laterally and use a little cunning. It's never worth confronting the problem, as the negativity is endemic-hence the Devil card often appears to describe situations that are not worth trying to fix or heal. The message is to simply walk away, to escape in the best way you can, regardless of the temptation of staying. The Devil often arrives in a relationship reading to show lust and negative ways of relating, in that one partner is gaining much more that the other. By extension of this, additional meanings of the Devil are addiction-issues with sex, food, substance abuse, and overall negative thinking patterns.
Some other specifics include the following:
* **Home:** Here, the Devil may indicate living with domineering people or dealing with a difficult landlord. Psychic vampires and generally negative people may drain your energy. You may feel controlled and invaded just now.
* **Relationships:** Difficult relationships are indicated here, such as controlling partners, lust-over-love situations, affairs, and codependent patterns. For separated partners, the Devil may show financial dependency or other ongoing money or property issues that keep you tied to the past.
* **Career and money:** You're experiencing bad financial contracts, careers that are unsatisfying, domineering bosses, or a toxic work environment-but you stay because you are financially trapped.
### HIS WISDOM MESSAGE
In one leap, you can be free.
### THE DEVIL'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Devil appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The devil: He is a symbol of internal or external oppression. Showing the shadow side of human nature, he suggests base instincts at work rather than the higher self.
* The tails: The tails show lower instincts taking shape in our lives. The woman's tail shows fruit, echoing the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden, which she has now eaten. The man's tail is devil-like and appears to be catching the color of the Devil's torch, symbolizing corruption.
* The chains: Representing control and dependency, the chains illustrate emotional and material bonds that are habitual but not necessary.
* The torch: The torch is not held up to illuminate the scene, or situation; the Devil keeps his knowledge and his power for himself.
* The inverted pentagram: The upright pentagram stands for humanity and being humane. When reversed, it is a sign of cruelty and dark forces. The symbol can also be seen as a representation of the Devil's head, with the pointed beard at the lowest point of the pentagram and his ears and horn the middle and upper points.
### THE HISTORICAL DEVIL: DARK ARCHETYPES
In the Visconti-Sforza tarots of the Renaissance, the Devil is a terrifying monster with two heads-one devil, one human-and the Devil's mouth is busy devouring a small naked man. While the man-eating beast was a popular motif in early paintings showing the Last Judgement, myths of devilish gods date back to the Greeks and Romans. The Greek Cronos, god of time, ate his own children. He is associated with aspects of Roman god Saturn, who appears in the fifteenth-century Tarrochi of Mantegna cards as Saturno, a man holding a serpent biting its tail-making the shape of the ouroboros, the alchemical symbol for never-ending time. With his other hand, he is raising a child to his mouth, about to consume it. Four other children await their fate at his feet.
In the mid-fifteenth-century Griggoneur tarots, the Devil is an upright figure with a human body. Goatlike and bearded, with horns and clawed feet, he has a strange devil's face painted on his groin to show the dangers of lust. The devil-in-the-pants motif is also seen in the painting *Devils Waiting for the Last Judgement* (*Livre de la vigne nostre Seigneur*, France 1450-1470). Here, the devil head over the genitals has a big laviscious tongue, making the message of lust and sexual temptation all the more evident.
The Rider-Waite's devil is the traditional Pan or Satan, an embodiment of the Devil archetype across the ages.
### THE DEVIL'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Devil in these minor arcana cards:
* The Two of Swords, for being stuck
* The Eight of Swords, for restriction
* The Three of Swords, for conflict and betrayal

When reversed, this is one of the few cards whose meaning becomes more hopeful. With the upright Devil, it's time to acknowledge how you may be trapped and to begin to search for the light. When reversed, the Devil suggests the decision you need to make will be easier than you think. When the card is upside down, the chains around the couple are more lax than they appear, so a situation is not quite as drastic as you first thought. Now is the time to make your move.

In terms of health, a difficult cycle is about to end. Addiction and bad habits become easier to manage and eventually banish, and you or those close to you can look forward to recovery.",The Devil,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,1528,8990

### UNDERSTANDING THE TOWER
The Tower is aflame, struck by lightning that has thrown two figures to the ground. A crown, once atop the Tower, is blasted into the darkness as nature asserts her power over Earth. In early French tarots, the card is named la Maison Dieu, the House of God, calling to mind the burning of the Tower of Babel as divine retribution for our sins, a story told in the rabbinic text the Midrash. Genesis offers an alternative story: The Tower and city were abandoned, not burned, when God made the Babylonians speak in incomprehensible languages.
As with the other supposedly dark cards in the major arcana-Death and the Devil-there is always a way forward, provided we can accept a force that is higher than us and adapt to a new way of living and relating to each other. If we've been cossetting ourselves away in ivory towers, it's time to come back down to earth.
The Tower marks a point of awakening. In the major arcana sequence, it falls after the Devil. If the Devil is pride, ego, and arrogance, then the Tower is a fall from grace. It is a necessary stage of breakdown and rebuilding so our horizons can expand. We must look for a new place to be, physically or spiritually, and engage with new concepts and people if we are to progress to card XVII, The Star, which offers hope and the chance to follow a dream.
The Devil's number, XVI, comprises the mystical number 7 doubled (see VII, The Chariot, page 58). Also, in numerology, XVI reduces to VII (1 + 6 = 7), or the Chariot, which is powered by the charioteer's determination. With the Tower, our willpower has no effect. Only the will of God determines the outcome. In this sense, the Tower, along with the Wheel of Fortune (see page 70), is a card of fate.
### THE TOWER'S ASTROLOGY
The Tower's planet is Mars, fiery and masculine, forceful and warlike. Although Mars's energy can bring destruction, with this comes a release, a breakthrough.
### THE TOWER AND KABBALA
The kabbalistic letter of the Tower is Peh, which means mouth, and also expression, words, and speech, perhaps relating to the Babyloneans' speaking in different tongues. Another meaning of Peh is chaos-the impact of the falling Tower.
On the Tree of Life, the Tower is placed on the twenty-seventh pathway between the spheres of Hod and Netzach, or the logical mind and the forces of nature. Whatever we think, we are always subject to higher forces.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Tower hits us with sudden change: the collapse of an ideal, a dream, an organization, or a relationship. This is inevitable and is due to forces beyond your control. The Tower can represent shattered ego, so you may feel vulnerable and confused. Yet you can only surrender to the power of the Tower and work on accepting the huge shift in awareness it offers-although the benefits may not be obvious just yet.
The upside of the Tower is its message of release. The walls come tumbling down, but in the moment of destruction, everything is illuminated. You can see inside the Tower and look at how you built it-how you lived in your psychological tower and what it protected you from. Now, you can experience a flash of deep insight. With the Tower gone, you can begin to sense how the future might evolve. What you build next can have more foundation.
Some readers find the Tower an apt descriptor of migraines, with the buildup of pressure and intense pain. The Tower's lightning bolt has also been likened to sexual tension and earth-shattering release.
Here are some other possibilities the Tower may signify:
* **Home:** The Tower can illustrate an abrupt change to your circumstances. A property you hoped to move into does not materialize, or you encounter delays to building projects, for example.
* **Relationships:** A secret comes to light, which may be shocking. It is time to let go of past patterns of relating. Equally, you may experience an intense physical or spiritual attraction, which has a profound impact on your orderly existence.
* **Career and money:** Restructuring in businesses, possible redundancies that may mean a move to alternative premises-the Tower signifies change. A person in a position of power makes tough decisions, and a leader may be ousted from their post.
### ITS WISDOM MESSAGE
Surrender.
### THE TOWER'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Tower appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The tower: Illustrating society, protection, and the ego, a lone tower can also symbolize the past.
See the symbol of the watchtowers on card XVIII, The Moon.
* The falling figures: The figures symbolize humanity at the mercy of God and the power of nature. They also represent the fallout that disaster can bring-emotional, physical, and financial.
* Fire: Fire is the element associated with Mars, both the planet and the Roman god of war. It symbolizes change, rebirth, and purification.
See this symbol as a negative aspect in card XV, The Devil, on his torch, and as a positive symbol of growth on card XIX, The Sun.
* The golden droplets: On the Rider-Waite card, the flames emit golden droplets in the form of the Hebrew letter J, meaning fire. There are twenty-two, the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet and the number of major arcana cards in a traditional tarot deck.
See this symbol on card XVIII, The Moon.
* Lightning bolt: The lightning bolt is a symbol of enlightenment and purification, revealing what has been hidden. In a flash, we are spiritually awakened and cleansed of negative karma.
The falling crown: The crown is a symbol of power and sovereignty. The falling crown shows that worldly power no longer holds-nature is a far greater force. We are not in control or protected by our ego anymore.
### THE HISTORICAL TOWER: PUNISHMENT AND PURIFICATION
Throughout the years of tarot history, the Tower has always been burning, although with minor variations. The Visconti-Sforza cards of the Renaissance era show a cross at the bottom of the Tower, a symbol of resurrection after chaos. This may reference attacks on the Catholic faith by heretics, which were common in the fifteenth century. The Tower, a symbol of the power of the Church, is not struck down by God-the flames appear to have been created by the intense heat from two suns, symbols of diverse political forces. On our Rider-Waite card, the burning Tower links with Midrash's account of the fall of the Tower of Babel. It may also be a depiction of God's punishment of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which were burned to the ground in retribution for the people's sins.
The lightning bolt is a magical symbol in many myths and belief systems: A flash of lightning from Zeus impregnated Semele, Princess of Thebes, with her son, Dionysus, the god of wine-thus the lightning bolt is a nod to the shift in consciousness that the Tower brings. Buddhism has its own sacred lightning bolt, a djore (Tibet) or vajra (India), a symbol for the purification of the mind, which, in a flash, releases the negative karma with which we are born.
### THE TOWER'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Tower in these minor arcana cards:
* The Seven of Swords, for loss
* The Three of Swords, for sorrow and pain
* The Five of Cups, for loss and upset
* The Eight of Cups, for emotional upheaval
* The Ten of Wands, for overwhelm and burdens
### TRY A READING WITH THE TOWER: LETTING GO
Take the Tower from your deck and lay it before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose six cards with your left hand and place them around the Tower, as shown. You could ask, ""What will be released?"" or ""Is my present position in my career/relationship/home secure?""

When the Tower is reversed, you may find yourself taking responsibility even when you are blameless. It can also show you have held on to a career, project, or relationship that is not strong enough to stand the test of time. If you have clung to the past to protect yourself from reality, your fears may materialize. The Tower's collapse is inevitable, so do not feel responsible for forces outside your control.

Alternative Names: Hope, The Stars

Astrological Sign or Planet: Aquarius the Water Carrier
Element: Air
Hebrew Letter: Tzaddi
Symbol: The fishhook
Meaning: Hope
Tree of Life Pathway: Eighteenth, between Yesod and Netzach
Chakra: Higher heart, for universal love
Key Meanings: Hope, guidance, inspiration, and creativity
### UNDERSTANDING THE STAR
Like the water carrier of her zodiac sign of Aquarius, a maiden is pouring water from two vessels, one onto the earth and the other into a pool. It is twilight, but we can see clearly a tree and a tiny bird on the right of this serene landscape. At one with the natural world, this woman is a maiden aspect of the earth goddess, or card III, The Empress. Her nakedness under the stars shows purity and truth, and she is connected with the cosmos and the divine. There are eight stars above her, and one of them, a guiding star, is much bigger than the others. The Star card reveals hope and guidance.
In the major arcana sequence, the Star comes after XVI, The Tower, and before XVIII, The Moon. After the Tower's destruction, the maiden and her stars are a sign of hope for a new world. The cycles of nature continue, present in the four elements represented on the card: Earth, Air, and Water, with Fire suggested by the yellow guiding star. Pouring calming water onto the earth and into the pool, she heals the past and the present.
The Star's number, XVII, comprises 7 and 1, adding up to 8, or VIII, Strength. Strength shows a clothed woman holding the jaws of a lion, in a bid to control dangerous instincts. In the Star, the maiden has ascended to a more conscious state of awareness. She can let the water flow, trusting that she is on her path. In some decks, this card may show a winged maiden to illustrate angelic guidance.
### THE STAR'S ASTROLOGY
The Star's sign is Aquarius the Water Carrier (January 21-February 19), and the element of the card is Air. Water represents insight, consciousness, and healing and Air, thought and idealism, suggesting the social conscience with which Aquarians are so often attributed.
### THE STAR AND KABBALA
The Hebrew letter of the Star is *Tzaddi*, meaning the fishhook; it also takes the meaning of hope. On the Tree of Life, the Star is placed on the eighteenth pathway, between the spheres of Yesod and Netzach. Yesod is the sphere of magic and the moon, while Yesod stands for sensual passion and instinct. The Star is therefore the result of both these aspects, bringing together the qualities of
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Star offers hope and guidance, so if things have felt difficult recently, have faith that your luck is about to change for the better. The Star is a powerful symbol of hope, and you can begin to appreciate everything life has to offer, including better physical and spiritual well-being. The Star supports beauty, and creativity flows like the star-maiden's water. In your projects and relationships, you can be fully expressed, sharing your love, gifts, and talents. The Star allows you to shine and show your Star quality, so your efforts are appreciated. You may also feel more intuitive and insightful under the Star's influence and have more trust in messages from your angels and guides. The Star also shows good health. It is the card of the healer and is traditionally associated with astrology.
The Star can also indicate the following:
* **Home:** You feel inspired to create beauty and style in your home, so craft projects and design are especially favored now. If you have your eye on a dream home, it will come to you.
* **Relationships:** The Star shows that you are destined to be with someone; it is time to find a soul mate. Other existing relationships are calm and harmonious.
* **Career and money:** The Star brings money luck. Work you do begins to pay off, as you have considered your long-term goals and given attention to what matters most. Entrepreneurs may be guided to begin a new business, or you find you have a hidden talent you can put to good use. The Star can also show awards and fame.
### ITS WISDOM MESSAGE
Be inspired-dreams come true.
### THE STAR'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Star appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The eight stars and guiding star: Hope and divine guidance are embodied by the stars. The central yellow star, according to A. E. Waite, is a symbol of Freemasonry called the Flamboyant Star, or Seal of Solomon. (Waite had become a Freemason in 1901.) However, this talisman is usually shown with six rather than eight points, so perhaps this was to be just one aspect of its meaning. The star may also represent Sirius, or Venus (see The Historical Star). The eight stars each have eight points, symbolizing renewal. Eight is also the sum of the Star's number, 17.
See the star crown and canopy of stars on card VII, The Chariot.
* The maiden: A symbol of eternal youth and the creative soul, she may be the Greek Aphrodite or the Egyptian deity Isis (see The Historical Star).
See the maiden as a symbol of civilization on card VII, Strength.
* The bird: The bird may symbolize the dove of Aphrodite or the ibis of Isis (see History). The ibis may be an intentional link with the card's Hebrew letter Tzaddi, which, according to tarot scholar Jonathan Dee, is ""the perfect fishhook."" The ibis also links with the Egyptian god Thoth, who was sometimes shown with the head of an ibis, one of his sacred creatures. In general, birds are symbols of freedom and the soul.
* Flowing water: This is the water of life, symbolizing resourcefulness and healing. The star-maiden pours water into the pool and onto the earth to nourish it, just as the goddesses Venus and Isis brought fertility to the land.
### THE HISTORICAL STAR: GODDESSES AND ANGELS
The image of the maiden and star has altered little over the centuries, from its simplest form in the Visconti-Sforza tarots-a woman holding a star-to the more illustrative Rider-Waite image, to which is added a pool, tree, and bird.
The star maiden herself may be Greek love and fertility goddess Aphrodite, the Roman Venus, who is often pictured with a dove. If so, the star above her is Venus, the Morning Star. An alternative identity is the Egyptian Isis, queen of magic and fertility, associated with the Ibis bird. If this is so, the big star is her symbol, Sirius, also known as the Star of Isis, fertility omen of the Nile. Legend has it that when Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, appeared, the Nile flooded, watering the crops growing on the silt bed of the delta.
In some decks, the star-maiden is an angel. The card also embodies Faith, one of the lost virtue cards of the tarot that existed in early decks. The early Faith cards of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries show a female figure holding in one hand one cup and in the other hand a cross. In this way, perhaps Faiths cup became subsumed into the two vessels of the Star, and her cross, symbol of religious guidance, went up to the heavens to become one of the eight stars in the sky.
### THE STAR'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Star in these minor arcana cards:
The Three of Coins, for creativity The Six of Cups, for harmony The Nine of Cups, for luck and a wish come true Ace of Wands, for creativity and inspiration Six of Wands, for victory and acknowledgment The Ace of Coins, for beginnings and money luck The Nine of Coins, for comfort and contentment
### TRY A READING WITH THE STAR: WISH UPON A STAR
Take the Star from your deck and lay it before you. Now shuffle the remaining card, and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose five cards with your left hand and place them around the Star, as shown. You could ask, ""What will inspire me?"" or ""Will my wish come true?""

In the reversed position, the Star can show giving up too easily in your projects and experiencing a creative block. You may be too attached to a fantasy scenario—after all, starlight is bewitching—while overlooking the details.

### UNDERSTANDING THE MOON
The Moon is a card of duality and emotional turmoil, with its two foreboding towers and two howling dogs. One dog appears domesticated while the other is wild-a wolf, even-representing the dual aspects of internal conflict. The sun-moon above appears to gaze upon the scene below, but the eyes are closed; the solar aspect, the perspective of daylight, is blind under moonlight. The central crayfish appears to struggle halfway between the water toward land. Something very important is about to surface.
The crayfish stands for the fearful self. He can just glimpse the long and winding road that yawns beyond the dogs and the towers. He senses that others have trodden this path before, but can he follow? And if he does, is there reward for taking this risk? Under the light of the sun-moon, what he is seeing may be an illusion, pure fantasy. As A. E. Waite says, The card represents the life of the imagination apart from the life of the spirit. This is the dark night of the soul, a lonely time when there is little but moonlight to guide us. We, like the crayfish, will need to make a decision in order to resolve the conflict between staying safe in a place we know and taking on the challenge of the unknown.
In the major arcana sequence, the Moon rises after card XVII, The Star, and before XIX, The Sun. With the Star, we have realized our guidance, the path we must follow, and the Moon shows the hidden impact of this realization, when deep-seated doubts and fears are realized. The Sun is the resolution of this dark night, a sanctuary before we make our final Judgment on our actions before the ending and beginning of our journey with the World. To heal the conflict of the Moon, we need to embody our higher self, our soul wisdom.
The Moon's number, XVIII, or 18, adds up to 9-IX, the number of the Hermit. Both the Moon and the Hermit show being alone and a time for self-reflection.
### THE MOON'S ASTROLOGY
The Moon's sign is Pisces, the Fish (February 20-March 20), whose element is emotional Water. In astrology, the Moon in Pisces means compassion and intuition. Pisces the Fish and stands for the soul, as well as sexuality and creativity.
### THE MOON AND KABBALA
The Hebrew letter of the Moon is Qoph or Kuf, meaning the back of the head and hidden problems. On the Tree of Life, the Moon is on the nineteenth pathway between the spheres of Malkuth and Netzach, or the logical mind and the unseen forces of nature-or what is ruminating under the surface.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Moon's traditional meaning is a crisis of faith and a period of emotional vulnerability. It reveals misgivings about a situation, as you cannot be sure if what you are seeing is the truth. Under the light of the Moon, is what you are seeing an illusion? Or does the Moon bring to light the essence of a problem that needs attention? This may be a time of deep emotional conflict, and the struggle is private rather than shared. You have a decision to make, and to choose wisely, you need to rely on your senses rather than logic. Take note of your intuitive messages and dreams now and acknowledge them as valid sources of information that will lead you in the right direction. The Moon can show you being asked to take a risk, to broaden your life experience. The prospect may make you uncomfortable, but the Moon asks you to dive deep and examine the real cause of unrest.
The Moon can also suggest the following:
* **Home:** You could be feeling disillusioned about your current living situation or having second thoughts about a move or home improvement project that is proving more costly than anticipated. On a positive note, you may intuitively find an object you thought was lost.
* **Relationships:** Confusion and disappointment reign as someone lets you down. A lack of trust that a relationship will work leads you to a love decision.
* **Career and money:** You may achieve a goal but ultimately feel it was not worth the effort. With colleagues, emotions run high, and you may need to protect yourself from others' negativity. Money matters are stable, but you want more satisfaction from work than just the paycheck.
### ITS WISDOM MESSAGE
Be guided by messages from your unconscious.
### THE MOON'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Moon appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The crayfish: This creature is a symbol of the primal self, which in this environment is not at peace and is struggling to surface, like subconscious fears.
* The wolf and dog: The canines show fear of the unknown. They also are guardians of experience, representing a rite of passage. The wolf is wild instinct and the dog, the tamed self.
See the dog on card 0, The Fool.
* The watchtowers or gates: These are the gates of Hades in classical mythology (see The Historical Moon). In a reading, these represent the boundary between the unconscious and conscious self.
See this symbol on card XIII, Death.
* The sun-moon: A full moon, crescent moon, and sun are merged. The moon is the subconscious aspect that affects how we behave in the solar world, which dominates the sleeping sun.
See the sun on card XIX, The Sun; VI, The Lovers; and 0, The Fool.
* The golden droplets: There are fifteen droplets in the shape of the Hebrew letter J, which means fire. This creates a strong tension with the water below the sun, which in combination symbolize conflict. A. E. Waite calls these droplets ""the dew of thought"" that emanate toward the world of the moon, or intuition and imagination.
See this symbol on card XVI, The Tower.
The path: The unknown-the path is poorly lit and only reflected light may guide us upon it.
See this symbol on card XIV, Temperance.
### THE HISTORICAL MOON: URANIA, DIANA, AND HECATE
As early tarot cards developed, three distinct Moon cards evolved, inspired by lunar goddesses. The Tarocchi of Mantegna has two lunar goddess cards, Luna and Urania. Luna holds a crescent moon while riding her chariot across the skies, while Urania shows a goddess with a blank circle and astronomer's compass. Luna is closely identified with the lunar goddess Diana the huntress (Artemis), often shown in traditional art with a bow and arrow. The Moon card of the Visconti-Sforza tarots shows Luna-Diana: She holds a crescent moon and what appears to be the skein from her bow, loose and useless-a symbol of failure and confusion. The fifteenth-century Griggoneur cards, however, took Urania as their inspiration. Urania, the muse of astronomy, carries a compass and globe in traditional paintings and statuary. On the Griggoneur Moon card, two astrologers stand under a waning moon; one holds his compass up while the other rests his on a book, as if making a calculation.
On the surface, the Rider-Waite card with its strange crayfish has a very different ancestry, dating back to a deck of around 1750 made by Joannes Palegius Mater, and Court de Gébelin's book *Le Monde Primitif* of 1781-yet, like the Moon card itself, a peek beneath the surface shows more than expected. The two towers and dogs are the symbols of Hecate, dark deity of magic-who is a shadow aspect of Luna-Diana. Hecate is the guardian of the gates of Hades, indicated by the card's two towers. The dogs are Hecate's companions-ancient statues of the goddess show her with hounds, and in her form as a triple goddess, she appeared with the head of a dog.
### THE MOON'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Moon in these minor arcana cards:
* The Two of coins, for weighing up your options
* The Five of coins, for insecurity The Nine of Swords, for anxiety
* The Seven of Cups, for fantasy and possibility The Three of Swords, for distress-what your heart is telling you The Two of Swords, for indecision
### TRY A READING WITH THE MOON: WHAT LIES BENEATH

When the Moon is reversed, you may avoid difficult emotions and confrontations, so your needs are not expressed or recognized.

### UNDERSTANDING THE SUN
In a sunny a walled garden, we are back in what appears to be the earthly paradise of card VI, The Lovers-yet now we are reaching higher levels of consciousness and awakening. With the Sun, we are seeing the cosmic light. The child on his horse is ready to return home, uniting his spirit with the spirit of the world. He is open-armed and full of joy, and his nakedness shows him as a child of nature. Psychiatrist Carl Jung saw the archetype of the child as an aspect of our developing personality. In this way, the Sun holds echoes of our own childhoods, revealing an opportunity to recapture our early days-an idealized time of innocence and happiness, free for a time from adult, worldly anxieties. In this sense, the Sun is one of the happiest cards of the tarot, offering sanctuary, growth, success, and happiness.
The child is in direct sunlight, in full awareness of himself and his place in the universe. He can see his way ahead-his world so unlike the darker world of the preceding card, the Moon, which can only offer reflected light. In the major arcana sequence, the Sun rises after card XVIII, The Moon, and before card XX, The World. Having faced the fears of the Moon, we, like the child, now see the light of the world and make ready to ride toward it, arriving at card XX, before our reincarnation as 0, The Fool.
The Sun's number, XIX, comprises 1 and 9, adding up to 10, or X for the Wheel of Fortune, which further reduces to I, The Magician. The Sun embodies action and the creative power of the Magician in the earthly realm and the dawning spiritual realization of the Wheel, at which point in our tarot journey we turn toward the higher aspects of life and our spiritual ascension.
### THE SUN'S ASTROLOGY
Naturally, the Sun is the planet of this card. The Sun is concerned with the solar, or outward aspects of the self, and renewed vitality after the dark night of soul encountered under the Moon. In the past, the card has been linked with Gemini the Twins as printed decks such as the Marseilles-style tarots show two children on the card rather than one child, as on the Rider-Waite.
### THE SUN AND KABBALA
The Hebrew letter of the Sun is Resh, meaning the head and also success. On the Tree of Life, the Sun appears on the twentieth pathway between the spheres of Yesod and Hod. Yesod governs the moon and the unconscious mind, and Hod is the sphere of the rational mind. The Sun integrates these two aspects, suggesting happiness and spiritual growth.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Sun brings success and achievement and is one of the most positive cards in the major arcana. If you have had a challenging time, the Sun shows that every aspect of your life will improve. You'll also enjoy more energy, and if you or someone close has suffered from health problems, the card predicts recovery and a return to good health. As a card of energy and growth, all your projects benefit now, so the Sun heralds a good time to nurture your creative endeavors, your business, and the relationships you value.
This card is also associated with children and family. It reveals good news about children in general and also about spending happy times with friends who make you smile. You may be reunited with an old friend, partner, or family member. In terms of a state of mind, the Sun shows you feeling carefree and creative, nurturing your inner child.
In a layout with ""negative"" cards, the sun has the power to shed a positive light on the whole reading.
Here's some other good news the Sun can predict:
* **Home:** You feel comfortable and secure in your home-you may also feel more like entertaining others. In particular, the Sun shows children coming into your home.
* **Relationships:** Partnerships bloom under the sun as your relationship grows and you enjoy every minute together. You may also take a trip away to a sunny place to escape everyday pressures.
* **Career and money:** The Sun does not specifically predict money but does show success and a position from which you can generate money. The Sun shines on your career, too, as you get the acknowledgment you deserve. Now is the time to bask in your success.
### ITS WISDOM MESSAGE

In the Rider-Waite tarot, the Sun appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The sun: The sun is a symbol of consciousness, happiness, and self-expression. The solar power of the sun signifies energy and good health. In numerology, the 21 rays of the sun reduce to III, The Empress-perhaps a link to the Empress as the mother of the divine child. See this symbol on XVIIII, The Moon; VI, The Lovers; XIV, Temperance; and 0, The Fool.
* The child or children: Simplicity, innocence, purity, and wholeness-These are all elements of the happy inner child. The child appears to have six small flowers in his or her hair in the spirit of celebration.
* The sunflowers: Growth, beauty, and strength-The sunflowers grow tall above the level of the wall, reaching upward to see what is beyond the boundaries. The four sunflowers may symbolize the four elements of Air, Water, Fire, and Earth-everything that is needed for life. The sunflower is a symbol of Clytie, a nymph who turns into a sunflower when mourning the loss of her lover, the sun god, Helios (the Greek Apollo). She always faces the sun, hoping to see Apollo's sun-chariot return. The sunflower is also a symbol of the Spiritualist church-as the sunflower when young turns its head to capture the sun throughout the day, so this tells us the search for the light is our true nature.
* The walled garden: Boundaries, security, and protection-A. E. Waite calls this ""the walled garden of the sensitive life.""
* The white-gray horse: He represents the vehicle for our soul-the physical body.
See this symbol on card XIII, Death.
The red flag: This illustrates energy and vitality.
The red feather: This familiar image represents the life force. See this symbol on card 0, The Fool; on card XIII, Death, the red feather is withered.
### THE HISTORICAL SUN: SPINNING AND SUNFLOWERS
One of the oldest Sun cards from the Visconti-Sforza tarots shows a male cherub holding aloft a glowing sun-face. The figure has one leg outstretched and the other rests on a deep-blue cloud over a landscape of blue mountains, water, and a grassy plain that ends in a cliff edge. All four traditional elements are present: Water, Earth, Fire (the sun), and Air, represented by the cherub's cloud. The fifteenth-century Griggoneur cards show a version of the Renaissance Moon card (see The Historical Moon in XVIII, The Moon), but his time Artemis-Diana carries an arrow and she is stretching a thread or skein from hand to hand, perhaps part of her bow-or as has been suggested by the tarot scholar Stuart Kaplan, she is spinning yarn. This suggests the Norse deity Frigg, protector of spinning and women, later associated with Artemis. Another interpretation is a connection with the Greek goddesses known as the Fates, who spin the thread of life, measure it, and cut it when life is over: the story of birth, lifetime, and death. Seventeenth-and eighteenth-century cards in the Marseilles style show two children in the garden, rather than one child, with a wall behind them. Flowers begin to appear in the nineteenth century, in the Fanciful Tarot (1852) and the Gaudais deck (c.1860). However, it appears that the Rider-Waite tarot's Sun card was the first to include prominent sunflowers as symbols of strength, light, and energizing solar power.
### THE SUN'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the Sun in these minor arcana cards:
* The Four of Wands, for happiness and freedom
* The Ace of Cups, for love and nurturing
* The Three of Cups, for celebration
* The Six of Wands, for success
* The Six of Cups, for harmony and old friends
### TRY A READING WITH THE SUN: FOUR WAYS TO SHINE
This reading takes the four elements of the sunflowers to divine your situation in terms of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Take the Sun from your deck and lay it at the top, as shown. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose four cards with your left hand and lay them from left to right as shown.
* **Card 1:** Earth: finances and property-what grounds you
* **Card 2:** Air: decisions-action to take
* **Card 3:** Fire: how projects will fare-communication
* **Card 4:** Water: letting emotions flow

### UNDERSTANDING JUDGMENT
Judgment depicts Judgment Day, prophesized by the apostle Paul in his letter to the Thessalonians when the souls of men would be awakened by an archangel's trumpet call and judged before God. The figures may be holding up their arms to embrace the moment of resurrection before judgment. Judgment is a personal wake-up call to consider our past actions. How do we judge ourselves? The archangel who blows the trumpet is Gabriel, and his wake-up call is a moment of revelation, when we can discover the truth of our relationship with ourselves. We may also be awakened to a new relationship with God, with our spirit guides, or with the angels-as one of the three Angel cards of the tarot, along with the Lovers and Temperance (see pages 54 and 86), Judgment can be a call to spiritual service.
In the major arcana sequence, Judgment comes after card XIX, The Sun, and before card XXI, The World. We have reached a sanctuary with the Sun, a reminder of the paradise of Adam and Eve of the Lovers card, but before we can complete our cycle, we must make some decisions and gain some acceptance about the past. When this is done, we can evolve to a state of completion and rebirth, offered by the World, before we return to card 0, The Fool. When the Last Judgment of man is complete, a new world is created-which the Fool will discover when he incarnates once again and his journey begins anew.
Judgment's number, XX, is composed of two tens and implies balancing our past actions. It reduces to the number two, or II in the major arcana cards (10 + 10 = 20; 2 + 0 = 2), the number of The High Priestess, who stands between the earth plane and the world of the dead. Judgment also links with card XI, Justice (whose number, XI, also reduces to II). While Justice is an external judgment upon us, Judgment is how we judge ourselves. At this time, we can reflect on the past, assess our actions, and release the experience so we can move forward.
### JUDGMENT'S ASTROLOGY
Judgment is associated with Pluto, who was the Roman god of the dead and the underworld. The planet Pluto is also associated with transformation at a deep level. The element of Judgment is Fire, perhaps a reference to flames of purification and the burning of the physical body in rituals of cremation.
### JUDGMENT AND KABBALA
The kabbalistic number of Judgment is Shin, meaning tooth. The letter takes the form of three upright stokes, like a W, which could be interpreted as the three aspects of consciousness highlighted by Judgment-the past, present, and future. Shin also stands for Shaddai, a name for God. One of the meanings of Shin in the sacred ancient text Sefer Yetzirah is head in the soul, a perfect descriptor for Judgment, as we mentally assess our past actions. Shin also comes up in the phrase Sh'at haShin (the Shin Hour), which roughly translates as ""the eleventh hour."" Judgment certainly tells us that the time is now. On the Tree of Life, Judgment is placed on the twenty-first pathway between the spheres of Malkuth, our perceived world, and Hod, wisdom and the mind-just as Judgment asks us to assess our place in the world according to our deeds.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
It is time to come to a decision about the past. Great changes and opportunities are on the horizon, but before you can decide on your direction, certain past issues need to be addressed. This process is purely about how you judge yourself on your past actions and attitudes. In the upright position, Judgment shows you will feel you have acted with integrity and did the best you could. As you accept yourself fully, you can blow your own trumpet and praise yourself for your achievements. An additional meaning is being in the public eye, hence Fame, the card's alternative title. Judgment also predicts a spiritual awakening, as you feel called to explore your potential. You have learned much about yourself in this most recent phase and are ready to go further, developing your spiritual connection with your guides and angels. As you receive guidance on your path, your confidence and wisdom will grow.
Here's more insight:
* **Home:** You may be drawn to an old property or consider returning to a place that holds happy memories. You will soon need to make a major property decision.
* **Relationships:** Love is assessed and shifts into a new phase. There may be a need for reconciliation, if you deem the relationship worthwhile. If you are single, you may revisit an old relationship and decide if it is worth trying again. An old friend may reappear.
### Career and money
Acknowledgment for your successes is coming; finances also improve.
### ITS WISDOM MESSAGE
Look back with pleasure.
### JUDGMENT'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, Judgment appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The archangel: Symbolizing awakening, the Archangel is Gabriel, but the flag on his trumpet is that of dragon-slaying St. George, patron saint of England, linked with Archangel Michael. Michael's element is Fire, the element of this card, although what we see on the card is Water, the element of Archangel Gabriel. The archangel, therefore, may be an amalgamation of both Michael and Gabriel.
See archangels Raphael and Michael on card VI, The Lovers, and card XIV, Temperance.
* The trumpet: The call of the trumpet tells us it is time to resurrect the past and make a decision. Heralds blew on trumpets to announce war, and also the presence of royalty and other dignitaries, explaining the card's alternative title, Fame.
The dead rising: The rising dead are resurrection and rebirth. The six figures are shown in two groups of three that reflect different phases of the past. They are man, woman, and child, asking us to look at our roles and relationships. Naked, they are about to be reborn. The child symbolizes the spirit of the new age.
The open coffins: Transformation is illustrated by the figures rising from the restriction of their coffins into a new consciousness.
The flag of St. George: The flag bears St. George's cross, for England's patron saint. The red and white symbolize the unification of opposites.
The sea and glaciers: The water is a symbol of purification; the past can be forgiven and washed away. The glaciers feel like a paradise, a new world about to be born.
### HISTORICAL JUDGMENT: GOD AND GABRIEL
The oldest tarot decks show one or two angels calling the dead from their graves, usually three people at various stages of emergence. In the Visconti-Sforza tarot held at the Carey Collection at Yale University, we see the walls of a city, showing that the dead exist in another territory. Just discernible is a tiny bridge between the two angels and water running under it, perhaps indicating the river of souls or the Styx, which carried the souls of the dead to the otherworld. In some Renaissance tarots, the angels are replaced by God. In most tarot decks, the dead are naked, as if being reborn, to resurrect the past in order to judge it, release it, and allow ourselves to be complete before we encounter the final card in the major arcana sequence, the World, before beginning our journey again with 0, The Fool.
### JUDGMENT'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of Judgment in these minor arcana cards:
* The Six of Cups, for nostalgia and reunions
* The Nine of Cups, for contentment in achievement

### UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD
One of the most positive cards of the major arcana, the World signals success and completion. In the center of an oval laurel wreath a figure dances, holding a wand in each hand. Protected by four figures from the Wheel of Fortune, who are symbols of the four evangelists of the gospels, the dancer is also the Fool. From his humble beginnings, he has traveled the world in body and spirit and is about to be reborn in his own card, 0. The dancer is obviously female from the waist up, but it is believed that the swathe of fabric conceals the male genitals of the Fool. This hermaphrodite dancer shows the perfect balancing of opposites, the sun and moon (the two previous cards, XVIII and XIX), our male and female aspects, and the conscious and the unconscious minds. With the world at our feet, we are ascending to higher realms of understanding.
A. E. Waite explains in his Pictorial Key to the Tarot how the World ""represents also the perfection and end of the Cosmos, the secret which is within it, the rapture of the universe when it understands itself in God. It is further the state of the soul in the consciousness of Divine Vision, reflected from the self-knowing spirit."" We can see the World as a card of perfection and of peace. We are dancing all over the world, in harmony within ourselves and with all others.
The Wheel of Fortune as card X and the World as XXI mark two key points in the major arcana journey-the Wheel is halfway, when the Fool turns to the second, cosmic phase of his spiritual quest, while the World is the card of completion and renewal. Before the Wheel and the World are two cards of self-reflection-the Hermit and Judgment (see pages 66 and 110). The World's number, XXI, comprises 2 and 1, adding up to III for Mother Earth, the Empress. This fertility aspect is embedded in the World as the seed of new life and the new tarot cycle.
### THE WORLD'S ASTROLOGY
The taskmaster planet, Saturn, is the ruler of the World. The planet symbolizes decisions and hard work and shows you deserve all your success. The four evangelists on the card (see The World's Symbols) link with the four elements, the four minor arcana suits of Cups, Wands, Pentacles, and Swords, and the four fixed signs of the zodiac-Aquarius (Air, the angel), Taurus (Earth, the bull), Leo (Fire, the lion), and Scorpio (Water, the eagle).
### THE WORLD AND KABBALA
The Hebrew letter of the World is Tav, symbolized by a cross, which can represent the four directions and four elements of Fire, Air, Earth, and Water; the meaning of the character is completion, the card's message. On the Tree of Life, the World is placed on the twenty-second pathway between Yesod and Malkuth. Yesod means change and magic and Mulkuth, the earth itself: in combination, the ongoing cycle of birth, life, and rebirth.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright card denotes triumph, completion, and reward for your efforts-and for this reason, the World is one of the most welcome cards in a reading. It denotes deep joy and happiness, and now you can really feel your deserved success. Cherished projects fly, as your commitment and dedication pays off. Life feels balanced, too, as work, relationships, finances, and domestic affairs run smoothly. A phase is coming to an end in a positive way, and you will be acknowledged publicly for what you do. Now is the time to enjoy your fame, and you will have the confidence to take center stage. If you have been waiting for a decision or opportunity to manifest, the World will soon turn in your favor. You may also benefit spiritually just now, living more mindfully and from the heart. This is also a time for celebration, and in a reading, the World often reveals anniversaries, birthdays, and parties, so it is a great card for groups and positive group consciousness. You may also decide to venture out into the world and travel far afield.
The World could also mean the following:
* **Home:** A dream-home come true-whatever you have worked toward can be yours now, whether it's successful building work or other remodeling.
* **Relationships:** Happiness and joy-you have a relationship that is fulfilling and loving.
* **Career and money:** You're achieving your goals. An award at work, a new position and/or promotion-the World shows you rising in status and being given more authority. You may also receive gifts at this time.
### ITS WISDOM MESSAGE
Enjoy your success.
### THE WORLD'S SYMBOLS
In the Rider-Waite tarot, the World appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you'll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.
* The angel and three creatures: The angel and the lion, bull, and eagle are the symbols of the four evangelists-respectively Matthew, Mark, Luke and John-associated with the Four Gospels of the New Testament. The animals also link with the four elements and four fixed signs of the zodiac (see The World's Astrology).
See these symbols on card XXI, The Wheel of Fortune.
* The laurel garland: The laurel symbolizes victory. It is in the shape of the mandorla, an oval, which signifies heaven on earth and appears in religious icons to frame holy figures.
See this symbol on card III, The Empress, and VII, The Chariot.
* The garland's ribbons: The two ribbons are tied at the top and bottom of the garland in a figure-eight, or lemniscate, the symbol for infinity, the never-ending cycles of time and rhythms of nature.
See this symbol on card I, The Magician, and VIII, Strength.
* The world dancer: The dancer shows joy and celebration, the animus mundi or ""soul of the world"" (see The Historical World).
The wands: The wands symbolize the perfect balance of opposites: complete self-expression and the ability to make magic happen.
See this symbol on card I, The Magician.
### THE HISTORICAL WORLD: THE CITY AND THE WORLD SOUL
There are two distinct styles of World card, one in the Renaissance tradition and the other dating from the 1700s-the latter is the influence for the Rider-Waite World and those of many other contemporary decks. In the Renaissance Visconti-Sforza deck, two male cherubs hold aloft what appears to be a circular painting of an idealized city on an island, showing a twilight sky and stars-perfection on earth and in the heavens above. The composition for A. E. Waite's Rider-Waite card comes from the seventeenth-and eighteenth-century Marseilles-style cards, which show a dancer enclosed in a wreath with the four evangelists in each corner. The world dancer, and the belief that the world herself has a soul, is a part of Hermetic, Platonic, and Shamanic belief systems. What unites both styles of World card is the concept of enclosure, from the idealized city as a circular portrait to the mandorla, or laurel garland, around the world dancer-a symbol of completion and return to the beginning, the cosmic egg that is 0, The Fool.
### THE WORLD'S REFLECTIONS
We can see aspects of the World in these minor arcana cards:
* The Ten of Pentacles, for families coming together in love and financial reward
* The ten of Cups, for family love

ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_ace_of_cups,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## ACE OF CUPS
The Suit of Cups
**Element:** Water
**Astrological Associations:** The Water signs-Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces
**Number:** 1
**Tree of Life Position:** Kether, for divine light
**Key Meanings:** Love, relationships, and beginnings
### UNDERSTANDING THE ACE OF CUPS
A single chalice, offered from a hand extending from a cloud, is overflowing with five streams of water that pour into a lake below. Water lilies flourish on the lake's surface. There's also a bird, a white dove of peace, descending toward the chalice. In its beak is a wafer marked with the sign of the cross, for the Host, or Eucharist. This may symbolize Christ, or the spark of the Divine, the life force, entering the chalice or womb, for fertility at a physical, creative, or spiritual level, reflecting the card's Tree of Life sphere of Kether, for divine light. The bird, much like the folkloric stork bringing a baby in its beak, is about to deliver a gift. The chalice is offered with the right hand, the hand of giving (as opposed to the left hand, which traditionally is the receiving hand).
Twenty-six dewdrops appear to emanate around the top of the cup stem, which could be a representation of semen. They are similar in form to the droplets on the Aces of Swords and Wands; XVI, The Tower; and XVIII, The Moon (see pages 176, 204, 94, and 102). While the Rider-Waite tarot's originator, A. E. Waite, gives no specific meaning for the twenty-six droplets, this number may relate to the tetragrammaton of Y, H, V, H, the name of God in Hebrew, which is formed of the numeric values of the letters Yod, Hei, Vau, and Hei, adding up to twenty-six.
The Aces offer the pure energy of their suits. As number ones, they represent oneness with the divine spirit or God. Indivisible, their energy is singular, strong, and purposeful. They all represent beginnings, impulses, and new possibilities, in the most pure and obvious form.
Astrologically, this card is linked with the element of Water, which stands for the emotions and life-hence the Ace of Cups' association with pregnancy. The W on the cup appears like an upside-down M-and if so may stand for mother, or the Hebrew letter, Mem, whose associated symbol is water, for the emotions, reminding us of the traditionally feminine element of the suit of Cups.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Ace of Cups brings the gift of love and key emotional events: fertility, pregnancy, birth, and motherhood; when not predicting a pregnancy, it can reveal that being a parent and/or partner takes priority over work, finances, and projects. In relationships, the card denotes falling in love, passion, and a significant new partnership. In existing relationships, it signifies loves and support. Positive emotions flow.
If you are nurturing a new project, this Ace heralds creativity and growth, so make time for activities you enjoy, and you will see them flourish. An enterprise you hold dear will come to fruition, so it's time to turn to your novel, business concept, or travel plan and give it your full attention. This is also a great card for spiritual growth, so you may find yourself discovering a belief system or other important way to explore your spirituality.
Generally, this is a time for love, kindness, conviviality, and good friends, the simple joy in living each day and appreciating every moment.
In a reading, one Ace brings a focus on the life area according to the suit, which can set the theme of the reading. If two or more Aces appear near each other in a reading, it means the following:
* Two Aces: An important partnership
* Three Aces: Good news
* Four Aces: Excitement, beginnings, and potential","### REVERSED MEANING

As you might expect from the meaning of the upright card, when reversed, the Ace suggests fertility issues and creative block. There may be lack of space and time to nurture your relationships and projects, or you may be the one feeling neglected; conversely, you may be feeling exhausted due to others' emotional demands. If you are asking about a new relationship, sadly, the reversed One can indicate disappointment and confusion—a potential new love does not develop into something more lasting.

In general, the reversed card reveals insecurity and doubt, and you may not feel you can believe in those people you'd like to trust. Follow your instincts and hold on to your self-belief; thankfully, this influence will not last.",Ace of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,622,3650
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_two_of_cups,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## TWO OF CUPS
Element: Water
Astrological Association: Venus in Cancer
Number: 2
Tree of Life Position: Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom
Key Meanings: Love and partnerships old and new
### UNDERSTANDING THE TWO OF CUPS
A man and a woman face each other, eye to eye, each offering the other a cup. Between them is a strange symbol: the caduceus of Hermes and a lion's head. The caduceus is a central rod entwined by two snakes, an ancient symbol of negotiation and balance associated with the winged Greek messenger-god, Hermes, the Roman Mercury. The lion, although not given a specific meaning by the card's creator, A. E. Waite, can be interpreted as a symbol of passion and protection. The maiden is dressed in the colors of the High Priestess (see page 38)-blue and white-while the young man wears a tunic and boots similar to those of the Fool, card 0; even the colors of his tunic-yellow, red, and black-are similar to those of the Fool. The combination of the Fool's meaning of beginnings and risk along with the virginal High Priestess's intuition reveals that a brand-new relationship may be in the cards. The maiden is crowned with an olive garland, while our Fool sports a garland of red flowers; together, the garlands signify success and love. Their cups tell us that they are showing their emotions, and the man's hand is reaching out toward the woman's cup-a signifier of sexual intention, as cups are traditionally a womb symbol, just as the wand is phallic. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom, the father, and male virility. Astrologically, this card is linked with Venus in Cancer, a pairing that promotes intuition, love, and emotional support. There's also a sense of domestic bliss here, shown by the idyllic cottage and green fields behind the couple. The number of the card, two, is for two people: relationships and other significant partnerships.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Two of Cups represents harmony, peace, partnership, and love. In relationships, the card signifies a deeper commitment in an existing relationship, such as an engagement, moving in together, or getting married (particularly when it appears with the ""marriage"" cards, V, The Hierophant, and the Ten of Pentacles). There's a great connection between you two, so your emotions are freely expressed and reciprocated; you feel whole and content. The Two of Cups also predicts new romance and strong passions, which may be all-consuming just now. Inspiring partnerships are favored too, so this is an auspicious card for getting together with a study partner or anyone with whom you share similar creative interests, such as writing, crafting, and other hobbies, or psychic and healing work. Whomever you hook up with, the relationship will be mutually supportive and understanding. If friendships have been difficult territory for you recently, the Two of Cups shows harmony will return, and in general, this Two shows reconciliation. Old arguments will be resolved as you put the past behind you. Any ongoing negotiations will go in your favor, too-contracts, financial settlements, custody issues, or rearranging your working hours or schedule, for example.
If the Two represents you in your reading, the focus is on feelings and your intuition. Nurture all your relationships and enjoy the love and pleasure they bring. As a prediction card, it shows love: Deeper love is coming-and you deserve all that is on offer.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Two reveals relationship stress. A new romance may turn sour as your hopes for love are disappointed. Also, the card asks you to rely on your intuition; there may be a secret you don't yet know, and traditionally, the reversed Two can show infidelity. Although on the surface everything may appear to be ticking along, pay attention to your instincts; there's a reason for doubt, and it's time to communicate openly about any fears rather than ignore them.

Generally, in established relationships, the Two can also indicate an unavoidable glitch simply due to the ongoing stresses and strains of leading too-busy lives. If it seems like this is the case, try to keep communicating—there may be a lack of understanding between you just now, but with work on both sides, you can rekindle your connection. Passion may be on hold just now, but it can return.",Two of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,574,3478
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_three_of_cups,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## THREE OF CUPS
Element: Water
Astrological Association: Mercury in Cancer
Number: 3
Tree of Life Position: Binah, the sphere of understanding
Key Meaning: Celebration, abundance, family, and friendships
### UNDERSTANDING THE THREE OF CUPS
Three maidens are raising their cups in a joint toast. They are so close together they almost appear as one, and in this way perhaps represent the three aspects of the goddess: maiden, mother, and crone-the whole experience of life. They can also be seen as three of the tarot virtue cards, denoted by the colors of their robes. The woman in white is the maiden from VIII, Strength; the woman in red, with her back to us, is crimson-robed Justice, from card XI; and the woman in red and white links with the colors of Temperance's angel Gabriel. So Strength, Justice, and Temperance together give us parts of this card's meaning: vitality, balance, and reunion. The feminine aspect of the card is also expressed in the Tree of Life sphere Binah, which means understanding and represents the feminine principle.
The maidens are barefoot and free, their robes flowing, and together they appear to be dancing. Fully engaged with life, two women raise their cups with their right hands and the other toasts with her left hand. The right hand is the hand of giving and the left hand receives, so their poses shows they are able to both give and receive abundantly. The Three of Cups is also a card of earthly pleasures, symbolized by the garden of flowers and plentiful ripe fruits. Astrologically, the card is linked with Mercury in Cancer, which promotes sociability, fun, and going with the flow. The negative aspect of this conjunction is thoughtlessness and superficiality. So happy are these women in paradise that little else exists for them, but, quite rightly, they will enjoy their moment of happiness and success while they can.
The number three is dynamic-it is the number of creation. As the next card in the suit after the Two of Cups, for partnerships, the Three of Cups is naturally the next step as two people create three with a new baby or, symbolically, with the birth of a creative project. Three is also the number of the Empress, the goddess-mother archetype in the major arcana (see page 42).
### UPRIGHT MEANING
It's time to celebrate! The Three shows parties and reunions-from anniversaries, christenings, weddings, and birthdays to a great night out or weekend away with friends and family. This is a time for indulgence and reward, to enjoy other's company, be carefree, and have simple fun. There's also a flirtatious air about this Three, so if you're looking for a relationship, you'll soon be in the perfect situation and mood for lighthearted love.
The cups on the card are raised in a toast: There's a feeling of abundance, but if you're a wine-rather than water-drinker, or you've got a sweet tooth, you may be tempted to overindulge. However, whatever your pleasure, the Three ultimately reveals emotional and/or physical healing. Spending time with people who make you feel good raises your vibration and energy levels. This positive influence can also soothe physical ailments that are triggered or exacerbated by stress.
As three is the number of creation, this shows a creative time-literally, with a pregnancy or birth, or in your creative goals. Turn your focus to new ideas and share them, as whatever you do will be enjoyable and well received, and even rewarded, by others. It's time to let your talent shine.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Three of Cups can indicate a flirtation or indulgence gone too far, with affairs and heated emotions. In established relationships, there may be distance and a lack of cohesion and understanding. Someone close may be overly opinionated and egotistical, and the dynamics of a close relationship—romantic or friendship—become skewed. Emotional betrayal in friendships is also a common meaning of the Three of Cups.

Creativity takes a nosedive, too, as creative blocks abound; it may be hard to get started as you suffer a lack of motivation and support. If so, take a break and return to your projects when you feel more grounded and less affected by others' emotional demands.

This card can also show irritating or recurrent health problems that need your attention.",Three of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,588,3490

Number: 4
Tree of Life Position: Chesed, the sphere of love
Key Meanings: Restlessness and boredom
### UNDERSTANDING THE FOUR OF CUPS
A young man sits under a tree, his arms and legs crossed. Three cups are set out in a row before him. From a cloud, a hand holds out a fourth cup, resembling the one on the Ace of Cups, symbolizing a new start. Although the hand appears at his eye level, his eyes are downcast-he is refusing to acknowledge the offered cup. Disenchanted, he appears to be looking discontentedly at the three cups on the grass as if to indicate that the fourth cup, whatever it may represent, is bound to be just more of the same old thing. This is in sharp contrast to the Three of Cups, in which the cups are held aloft in celebration (see page 124). The young man's pose is defensive, and he has set himself apart from his own emotions and the possibility of change.
Regardless of his mood, the sky is blue and the outlook is bright. The tree that gives him refuge is in full leaf. If he were to stand up and move around, he could enjoy the abundant life going on all around him. In this way, the card shows the potential for others to see your light, to see you able to stand tall like a tree, rooted and firm, and with branches open to embrace whatever comes. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the individual sphere associated with this card is Chesed, for love. In the case of this Four, it shows that love and support are there, if one wants it.
Astrologically, this card is linked with the Moon in Cancer, which denotes sensitivity and deep intuition, which we see in the self-protective pose of the man, with his arms and legs crossed. The negative aspect of this conjunction is possessiveness and sentimentality-not wanting to let go of what we have, regardless of whether it makes us happy or not.
The number four is the number of stability, which in Cups, the suit of emotions, indicates inertia. Water needs to flow-if it rests too long, it stagnates. In this way, the Four of Cups shows an underlying restlessness, a feeling that something is not quite right, but habit keeps the young man from making a decision.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
If you are looking for a relationship, the Four of Cups shows disillusion. This card often comes up if you have been hurt in the past and protect yourself with a checklist, instantly rejecting anyone who doesn't live up to your exacting standards-to the degree that even if your soul mate came along right now, you wouldn't recognize his or her potential. I call this the ""Will I ever meet anyone I like?"" card. The answer is: You can and will, but it's time to risk opening up emotionally again. You may think you're ready for love, but there may be some past issues still to heal. If you're in an established relationship, the Four of Cups shows a tinge of boredom. This may be a phase, and if so, it's time to inject some romance; otherwise, you may find yourself staying in a relationship out of habit.
In work and home life, the card shows a static situation-you may feel bored with your job or need to make a positive change to your environment. Even a small change will go a long way to making you feel you are going forward, so look around for some much-needed inspiration-it isn't far away.","### REVERSED MEANING

The meaning of the reversed Four of Cups is generally the same as for the upright card, but with a higher degree of dissatisfaction—you may be yearning for change but don't yet know what you want. If so, it's important to try new tactics at work and address what needs to change in your relationship or environment. Try to express your needs now, rather than locking them up.

When the Four of Cups is reversed, the man's crossed legs echo the bent knee of card XII, The Hanged Man. One of this major arcana card's meanings is hanging around, feeling in limbo. Rather than wait for change, the message of the reversed Four of Cups is to take control and make life happen. Thankfully, this limbo is temporary—change is always possible.",Four of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,609,3334
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_five_of_cups,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## FIVE OF CUPS
Element: Water
Astrological Association: Mars in Scorpio
Number: 5
Tree of Life Position: Geburah, the sphere of power
Key Meanings: Loss, leaving, and sorrow
### UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE OF CUPS
A figure shrouded in black, for mourning, contemplates three overturned cups. These are the three standing cups from the Four of Cups, the previous card, which have been cast to the ground, spilling blood or wine and water. A small dwelling is set above a river, which flows under a bridge with two arches. This may be a home that he has left behind, a symbol of past happiness and security he is now separated from by water, evoking the mythical Styx that divided the world of the living from the otherworld of the dead. The river also suggests the saying ""a river of tears,"" in keeping with the sorrowful feel of the card. The mourner is in unfamiliar territory, a place of sadness, away from comfort and emotional security-at least for the time being. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Geburah, which means power, destruction, and cruelty. The mourner is powerless in his loss, which may or may not be cruel; yet what he doesn't appear to notice are the two vessels behind him, still standing. Three cups are overturned, but there are two that he can grasp-all he needs to do is to turn around and see them. While he cannot change past events, it is up to him to make the best of what remains.
Astrologically, this card is linked with Mars in Scorpio, bringing warlike qualities to the passionate sign of Scorpio, also linked with death and the past. The mourner is engrossed with the spilled cups, and it's worth noting that in the original Rider-Waite deck of 1910, his face was strangely red, the same color as the spilled wine or blood. While this may just be the artist using the same blood red for consistency, the blush indicates shame-shame and embarrassment about past actions or humiliation caused by a person or situation.
The number five in the tarot's minor arcana usually indicates imbalance and upset. After the stable, if boring, four, five brings disruption-but this is often necessary and can be the only way to shift energy and bring about healing and change. Five is also the number of humanity. The sadness of this card is universal, shared by all of us at some point in our lives.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Five of Cups is the card of upset and loss. It often shows sadness and confusion due to a breakup, disappointment or arguments in a close friendship, or the need to temporarily move away from a family member who has caused hurt. The card can also apply to leaving a job or home before you are ready to do so-you are forced to deal with whatever life throws your way, whether invited or not. This card can also refer to a loss of status or money. The gift of this five is that there is no mistaking what has happened because you feel it in every bone of your body. At this point, there is no going back. But all is not lost: You will be able to move onward and upward regardless. The two remaining cups on the card can show the support of friends, family, and colleagues. The Five of Cups can also come up in a reading for a bereavement and the natural sense of loss and grief this brings. It's also an indicator that you or the person you are reading for is revisiting the past, trying to assimilate old stress and sorrow in order to make a fresh start.","### REVERSED MEANING

The Five of Cups along with major arcana card XV, The Devil, are the only two cards in the tarot deck whose reversed interpretations are more positive than their upright meanings. The Five reversed reveals you have already experienced the lowest point in a downward cycle and, as a result, are close to recovery, finally letting go of painful past memories. Ready to pick up the pieces, you will be stronger than you were before, able to face reality and move forward. An additional meaning of the card is meeting up with old friends and, socially speaking, coming back to life.",Five of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,623,3432
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_six_of_cups,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## SIX OF CUPS
Element: Water
Astrological Association: Sun in Scorpio
Number: 6
Tree of Life Position: Tiphareth, the sphere of beauty and rebirth
Key Meanings: Harmony, childhood, reconciliation, and old friends
### UNDERSTANDING THE SIX OF CUPS
The two figures on this card look odd-an overgrown child in a red cap offering a cup to a girl dressed liked an old woman in the garden of a manor house and tower. One cup stands on a stone podium with a heraldic shield, while four cups stand upright before them. There's a fairytale theme at work here, which reminds us of childhood tales: little red cap, or little red riding hood, or even a child-prince awakening a princess grown old after one hundred years of sleep. However we interpret this otherworldly scene, it is designed to remind us of childhood and the past.
The tower and watchman on the left of the card symbolize protection and the flowers, spiritual blossoming and love. The star-shaped blooms may be white datura, or apple-thorn flowers, once used in herbal potions as an aphrodisiac or poison, but they also resemble a species of morning glory, which blooms early in the day-linking with a return to the early part of our lives, childhood and the past. Whichever flower we prefer, both carry the meaning of an otherworldly state of mind: Both apple thorn and morning glory were used as hallucinogens. Our hearts and minds are certainly not in the present moment.
In astrology, the Six of Cups is linked with the Sun in Scorpio, which stands for loyalty and strong bonds with friends, family, and partners. Scorpio is a sign of deep emotions and the past, again suggesting the impact of childhood experience. The Six of Cups' Tree of Life sphere is Tiphareth, for beauty and rebirth, which emphasizes the card's meaning of reconnection with people from the past.
The number six stands for serenity and peace. The six-pointed Star of David is composed of two triangles, representing the concept of heaven on earth-a reminder that we can realize the heavenly and spiritual aspects of ourselves in our daily lives to enjoy harmony in mind, body, and spirit. In the Six of Cups, the two themes are the past and the present. The challenge is to integrate our experiences, reconciling our past memories with present reality to create the future-the perfection of this idea is summed up in the Ten of Cups, the card of family and full emotional expression. The diagonal cross, known as the saltire cross, on the podium in the Six of Cups' garden makes the shape of the roman number X, or 10-again, offering an ideal concept of love on earth.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Six of Cups reveals happy memories and a time to recall childhood with fondness. Your children, if you have them, may help you reconnect with your own childhood, or you are able to give your inner child free rein to play and have fun without the usual burden of worries. This is a time for good things coming from the past-reunion parties, reconnecting with old friends and more distant family members, or literally going back to your roots. This card may predict a trip home or to a place with fond memories. In some way, the past returns to help you in the present, too, as conversations and reminiscing with old friends or contacts seeds a new idea or approach.
Overall, you will find the right balance in relationships and enjoy a period of peace and harmony. This Six of Cups also shows compassion and kindness, so if you have suffered poor treatment, your situation is set to improve. Sweet, happy times are ahead, and any disruptions or upsets will be soothed and remedied. In love, an old flame comes back, and you may need to weigh up if it is worth going back to the relationship.","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Six of Cups is reversed, nostalgia rules, and you may recall past events with more positivity than they deserve. The card can also show you feeling locked in the past as a way to avoid moving on. A particular relationship needs to stay in the past rather than be revived. Unexpected visitors or communications may stir up old memories, and if so, let the memories rest—these people have no place in your future just now.",Six of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,651,3716

Number: 7

Key Meanings: Opportunities and extremes
### UNDERSTANDING THE SEVEN OF CUPS
Seven cups appear to float in the sky, and a dark, anonymous figure seems to behold or even command them. Each cup has its own mini-cloud, rather like the Ace of Cups itself. And like the Ace multiplied, this card offers us seven potential gifts or beginnings-but it is up to us to discern what is feasible. At the moment, we're like the foreground figure: in the shadows, trying to discern reality from fantasy.
Each cup has an emergent symbol. The first cup shows a male face with curly hair, which echoes that of Archangel Michael, the angel of Temperance, card XIV, indicating a higher force may be at work. It can also be seen as your own reflection, a sign of your future potential. The tiny covered figure in the central cup symbolizes what is hidden and can be regarded as a symbol of Christ and ascending consciousness-the shadow figure, perhaps, is sensing a divine plan yet to be revealed.
The snake in the third cup stands for wisdom and flattery. (The snake also appears on card VI, The Lovers, and X, The Wheel of Fortune.) The tower on the rock appears to be a fantasy castle-as A. E. Waite says, ""the images are most especially those of the fantastic spirit."" The fifth cup shows overflowing jewels, for riches and abundance. The sixth cup shows a victory wreath like that on the Six of Wands, but on the cup itself is a shadowy likeness of a skull, casting doubt on this positive meaning-even this wreath-cup, the most obvious of symbols, is not what it seems. The wreath can mean fame, or reputation, which triumphs over death, just as in the procession of triumphs in the major arcana sequence (see page 11). The seventh cup shows a salamander or dragon with a forked tongue. Who knows if what we hear are lies or truth?
All in all, the this card's seven images, according to Waite, are those of ""reflection, sentiment, imagination, things seen in the glass of contemplation."" They are not real-yet.
In astrology, the Seven of Cups is linked with Venus in Scorpio, which stands for mad passions and extreme reactions. This meaning links with the interpretation for the reversed card, which can indicate obsessive thinking. Netzach, the card's Tree of Life sphere, means endurance and desire-in this card, we might interpret this as ongoing fantasy.
The number seven is a mystical number. It was sacred to the god Apollo, founder of the famous Delphic oracle, and is the number of the days of the week, the deadly sins, and the wonders of the world (see The Chariot, page 58). Seven represents possibilities: It comprises three, the number of heaven, and four, the number of earth-and so the potential to bring heaven down to earth, to manifest an ideal.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
Choices and confusion-While the seven brings the potential for amazing opportunities, these options and offers are insubstantial. At present, it's not clear what's feasible and what is fantasy, as everything feels up in the air, just like the floating cups on the card itself. Be discerning and find out what you can about each possible path, but ultimately you'll need to choose by paying attention to your instincts and emotions. This is not a test of logic: Go with the flow and trust your inner knowing. Don't rush. In relationships, the card can show new doorways opening again as joint finances improve. The Seven is also the card of the visionary and shows the beginning stages of a new project, when anything is possible. Dreams and visions are additional interpretations.","### REVERSED MEANING

The reversed Seven of Cups has much the same meaning as the upright card, but here, extreme emotions are in play. Be aware of the danger of idealizing a situation and avoiding a difficult truth; in relationships, the card can mean being deceived by appearances—a new lover may not be faithful. This is not the right time for commitment. Avoid becoming embroiled in drama; step back until your options are clear.",Seven of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,639,3713

**Number:** 8
**Tree of Life Position:** Hod, the sphere of majesty and the mind
**Key Meanings:** Departure, change, and emotional intelligence
### UNDERSTANDING THE EIGHT OF CUPS
Like card XVIII, The Moon, we see the sun and moon combined. Which will reign-the sun (the mind) or the moon (impulse and intuition)? This is nighttime, the moon's realm: Our hero turns away from his familiar surroundings under her light, guided by his instincts alone. The sun will have his time the next day, when it's time for plans and practicalities, but for now, he must go with the flow, following the water toward a new destination.
The cloaked man has found a way forward. He has navigated a ribbon of pathway by the low rocks, which gives way to a soft riverbank, where he walks purposefully, supported by his staff. This can be likened to the Magician's wand or the Hermit's staff, a symbol of internal guidance. His red cloak shows he has the ability to manifest his intentions. We also sense he left his cups just moments ago-the gap in the top line of three cups still puts him among them, as if he has only just said good-bye. With his back to us, he is firmly fixed on the mountain to the right, a symbol of challenges and new, great experiences to come. When he has journeyed around the mountain, we know that our hero will have an entirely different perspective.
This Eight of Cups' astrological association is Saturn in the sign of Pisces. Saturn, the task-master planet, in imaginative Pisces poses a potential conflict between practical needs and idealism. Perhaps the solution is found in the card's Tree of Life sphere, Hod. Its common meaning is majesty, and in this card, it refers to the mastery of the mind-finding solutions and direction.
Eight is the number of fulfilment. It comprises two fours, the number of stability, which, however, when interpreted in the suit of Cups, turns to dissatisfaction and boredom. The Eight of Cups therefore is boredom doubled-or at the very least, a situation that has become stagnant. Conversation, creativity, or money no longer flows, so it must be found elsewhere.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright Eight of Cups reveals a time of restlessness when it feels as if something is missing. Work and relationships may appear harmonious from the outside, but your intuition is nagging you. The result may be a departure. Traditionally, the Eight of Cups predicts you leave a situation or break an agreement that no longer gives you fulfilment. This should not be a hasty decision; only move on when you are sure that there is no more you can gain or contribute. When the timing is right, there's also less drama than you would expect: Like the figure on the card slipping away in the night, you can take your leave quietly and swiftly. Naturally, you may feel sadness but little regret-provided the timing is right.
Like the figure in red following the path of the river, it's now time to go with the flow. You'll soon feel energized to move on to where your interests and curiosity call. You can also feel content with what you have achieved.
This card often turns up in a reading to show that you have already left a situation emotionally, and action will follow as you now take your actual leave. It can also predict a time to travel, to explore physically or through spiritual journeying.","### REVERSED MEANING

What are you holding on to? Take stock: Are you clinging in to the past when you really do know that your current living situation has to change? When reversed, the Eight of Cups shows errors of judgment, so you jump too soon or stay too long, unable to see that there's an alternative way to do things. At this point, there's no logical solution; like the Eight of Cups' sphere of Hod, for the mind and its strategies, an intellectual approach might make you feel in control, but the way ahead is to follow your instincts. Timing is important now, so trust yourself that you will know the right time to move on, without self-pressure. An additional meaning of the card is being abandoned, leaving you confused as others move on from you—with undignified haste.",Eight of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,591,3416

### UNDERSTANDING THE NINE OF CUPS
A seated male figure is encircled by nine cups on a table. Radiant with pride, he shows off what he has in life: joy and achievement. The cups are trophies, rewards for his past efforts, on display for all to see. This is a card of true happiness; what the man possesses can be enjoyed to the full. As the table is covered with a cloth, there is also a sense of banqueting, the table set ready to welcome a party. Secure in his role as benefactor, it is the man's joy to share his riches with others. He is perfectly comfortable with this abundance, sitting squarely on a low bench wearing a cap and hose-both red for vitality and joie de vivre.
With lucky planet Jupiter in the idealistic sign of Pisces, astrologically the Nine of Cups has the meaning of good fortune, prosperity, fun, and the spirit of generosity. Piscean's natural humanitarianism comes to the fore, as what benefits our hero of the Nine of Cups will naturally be shared with others. The card's Tree of Life sphere, Yesod, means foundation. Ruled by the Moon, symbol of the unconscious, Yesod brings together intuition and logic in balance-an alignment with our life purpose.
As a nine of the suit of Cups, this card indicates emotions find their ultimate expression: Feelings flow. Nine also represents the triad of mind, body, and spirit, showing a perfect balance of all three aspects of our humanity. In this way, the Nine of Cups symbolizes joy that is perfectly expressed. The cups almost touch one another in a half circle symbolizing intimacy and connection.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Nine of Cups is known as the wish card of the tarot because it foretells a dream come true. Whatever you hope for can now come to fruition. Joy comes from prosperity, generosity, and optimism, alongside parties and entertainment.
In relationships, the Nine of Cups reveals new romance and rewarding friendships. Whatever feelings have been nurtured in the past can now be expressed as others show their hearts. The time for waiting for love is over; if love has grown, it will be declared fully. Friends will step closer to you as you feel more connected to your own heart. When fully living your truth, others respond. In the spirit of sharing, there is now an easy connection with others as projects begin and existing work becomes more rewarding. This is a time to communicate, laugh, and appreciate all you have.
If you are nurturing a new project or idea, the Nine of Cups heralds its growth, so listen to your intuition, make time for the activities that make you happy, and see them flourish. Astrologically, this card is linked with Jupiter in Pisces, which promotes imagination, artistic flair, and generosity-so it is time, also, to share and own your ideas. Independence will also be important at this time. The Nine also favors good health, as old tensions dissolve, flowing away in the waters of the past. Now is the time to appreciate the joy of the present.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, ego steps in—and with it self-centredness and emotional disconnection. This can manifest as smugness. More commonly in readings, the Nine reversed tells a tale of narcissism: You are faced with others’ inability to see beyond their own immediate needs. This influence can infect personal and professional relationships, which suffer as others forge ahead with their agendas for short-term gain, leaving you bruised. However, it’s also worth asking yourself if you are the one overstriving for recognition, sidelining others in the process.

In personal and business projects, uncertainty rules due to misunderstandings, and your plans may be delayed. Creativity can suffer at this time, too, with stop-start-stop frustration. Focus on maintaining balance and routine to help you navigate these difficult waters and hold on to those dreams and schemes. This may not be the right time for new ideas idea to flourish, but this doesn’t diminish your worth or the strength of your concepts.

Astrological Association: Mars in Pisces

Tree of Life Position: Malkuth, the Kingdom, the sphere of experience
Key Meanings: Prosperity, joy, family, and contentment
### UNDERSTANDING THE TEN OF CUPS
Here is an idealized family scene: mother, father, and their two children, who are dancing. We see their home, established above a river, and from the river plain below, the couple beholds ten glowing cups in the sky, arranged on a rainbow arc. The river flows, trees grow, and not one cloud can be seen. This family lives in abundance-shown also by their smart clothing-and they appear to be celebrating their achievement. This is their kingdom, their Malkuth, the card's Tree of Life sphere. What could be happier than this place of security and contentment?
The focus here is on the ideal of perfection. This is the perfect life, blessed by a vision of the ten cups; the rainbow is a symbol of hope and reward. We see only the backs of the couple and, although the children are engrossed in their own game, they are happy entertaining themselves while their parents raise their arms in thanks for all they have been given.
In numerology, ten represents completeness and perfection. In the Ten of Cups, this gives the meaning of greatest happiness. Out of the ten cups, four are directly touching, perhaps reflecting the familial connection between the four figures.
The Ten of Cups' astrological association reveals that feeling, rather than intellect, is foremost: The warlike influence of Mars dissipates when in the sign of gentle, idealistic Pisces, so the focus is on intuition and the emotions.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
One of the most positive cards of the minor arcana, the Ten of Cups reveals the benefits of love and the security of family; it favors children as an expression of love, and often reveals that children will do well socially and academically, succeeding in their studies. The card therefore predicts great happiness for couples and families or equivalent close friendship groups. In work, the Ten of Cups shows peace and harmony for business partnerships and other key networks. Togetherness, not competition, will be your strength. In fact, anything you do en masse will go well now, from sporting activities, committees, and choirs to group trips and collaborative projects.
In relationships, this is an emotional time, in wholly a positive way. Partnerships built on stability and trust become even more rewarding and supportive. Different generations of a family may come together and put aside old disagreements; it's a common card for forthcoming weddings, parties, and other significant celebrations. Communication between parents and children, children and grandparents, and other family members will grow stronger and be more fulfilling. If you have been searching for a new home, the Ten of Cups shows this will come to you, and it will be the right property in the right location for your needs.
In relation to projects, the card gives assurance that what you have worked hard for will finally come together. Financially, the Ten of Cups is a wonderful indicator of prosperity, which comes to you as a result of well-deserved achievement.","### Reversed
When reversed, the Ten of Cups retains much of its positive vibe, but with some irritating undercurrents and changes in friendships and family bonds. A family issue may need to be addressed as your routine is disrupted, or you sense discord in some relationships; also, you may feel that you're not getting an entitlement, from respect from different generations of the family to enjoying enough time with children. Your plans to bring friends and family together may falter due to miscommunication. Equally, the need to keep up appearances prevents authentic conversations and understanding.

Friends may also prove troublesome under the influence of the reversed Ten of Cups, and as a result, one or two confidants step back from your circle or introduce you to a new friend of theirs with whom you don't feel comfortable—which upsets your usually happy dynamic. However, other people you prefer will soon come into your orbit to take their place.

Do bear in mind, however, that these are temporary glitches, rather than major challenges—and that the reversed Ten of Cups' overriding meaning is still positive.",Ten of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,527,3213
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_page_of_cups,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## PAGE OF CUPS
Element: Earth of the suit of Water
Key Meaning: Love news
### UNDERSTANDING THE PAGE OF CUPS
A fairytale page holds a cup, contemplating a fish within it-which appears to look up at him as if about to communicate. The fish is a symbol here of dreams and emotions that have taken form, so the Page is contemplating that which has come from the deep-or his desires and impulses. In folklore and Chinese myth, the fish is a prosperity symbol; in the ancient Celtic story of Fionn MacCumhail (pronounced Finn MacCool), the hero eats the salmon of knowledge and becomes the wisest person in all the land; and in Paganism, the fish has been a fertility symbol associated with female genitalia. A secret symbol of faith for persecuted Christians during Greek and Roman times, the fish is also a symbol of the soul. But the Page is not all deep symbolism-there's playful magic and lightheartedness here, too-one of the key meanings of the card.
The Page stands on dry land, and behind him water flows; perhaps the fish has sprung from this river or ocean. The card's element is Earth of Water, which suggests that emotions, thoughts, and ideas-the water-can become as substantial as earth, or matter. The Page's tunic is decorated with water lilies, and as lilies are traditional signifiers of purity, this Page is pure of heart. His colors, blue and pink, stand for spirituality and love. The scarf around his hat flows down around his shoulders, echoing the flow of the water. From this, we can tell that his emotions are on show. One side of the scarf forms a scallop shape, another echo of the fish's natural habitat.
Pages and Knights in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Page in a reading by working with the card's imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As an influence:** The Page represents sociability, good company, and fun. Whatever your age, the Page reveals you will feel young at heart. As Pages are messengers, the Page of Cups brings good news about the emotional aspects of your life: relationships, children, and finances (when this has a direct impact on your relationships). In love, he can show a new potential partner is coming. This is not the Page himself-he is simply the messenger-but he lets you know that love is once more on the horizon. While it will be tempting to rush into a new romance, it may be wise to hold back a little. Other responsibilities such as extra work and exams can't be abandoned just yet. This card also favors imagination and creativity, and so augers well for new projects and opportunities to improve your home and lifestyle. If you have suffered periods of insecurity and doubt, the Page assures you that all is well and good times are ahead. Finances are also favored now.
**As a person:** An individual with an artistic temperament, this Page is a dreamer. He loves company, is highly emotional and intuitive, and is naturally generous, sometimes to a fault. He is a good friend and happy to introduce others into his circle. The Page can often indicate a sensitive child or other young person you care for.
**As the ""you"" card in a reading:** It's time to enjoy life's pleasures.
**As an influence:** If two or more Pages fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Pages: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed
* Three Pages: Lots of social activities
* Four Pages: A social group of young people","###  REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Page brings frustration and irresponsibility. Offers do not materialize; you may feel that life is all work and no play. As a person, the reversed Page is emotionally immature and attention-seeking, so you cannot rely on his perspective—he can only obsess about his own needs. This person may be living in a dream world and become very defensive when challenged. In family relationships, a child may find it difficult to communicate his or her feelings.

An additional meaning of the reversed Page is intoxication—too much partying. It's time to calm down and get back to an ordered routine.",Page of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,638,3661
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_knight_of_cups,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## KNIGHT OF CUPS
Element: Fire of the suit of Water
Astrological Associations: Aquarius and Pisces
Key Meaning: A proposal
### UNDERSTANDING THE KNIGHT OF CUPS
This is a proud knight indeed. With his heroic helmet topped with the wings of Hermes, Greek god of communication, he sits astride a dainty steed. Shiny and poised, he is dressed more for appearance than warfare. As traditionally knights all have a quest, this Knight's quest is love, signified by two elements on the card: his outstretched, empty cup, symbol of his quest for the holy grail of love; and the river flowing through the valley, which signifies that he will follow the course of his feelings. The blue of his armor links with the meaning of truth (shown also in card II, The High Priestess), while the red fish design on his tunic denotes passion, along with faith (see also the Page of Cups, page 140).
The card's element is Fire of the suit of Water. Together, this combination makes for conflicting feelings: Fire and Water cancel each other out, so the Knight veers between bravado and ultra-sensitivity. His words may be engaging, but he may hesitate when it comes to action-not the ideal quantities of a marital knight. In truth, we would rather have the cutting Knight of Swords or action-hero Knight of Wands to protect us and defend the realm. The Knight of Cups's characteristics are more in keeping with the idealized knights of Chrétien de Troyes's medieval tales, *Le Morte d'Arthur*-when courtship followed strict rituals. Love was an impossible ideal, and, often, an unattainable lady the object of obsession-a far cry from real, requited relationships in earthly life. Such is our Knight of Cups: full of potential, loud with declarations. But will his words of love translate into commitment?
Knights and Pages in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Knight in a reading by working with the card's imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As an influence:** The Knight of Cups heralds an emotional time-you may be bewitched by a new love interest (or even more than one), enjoy more romance with an existing partner, and/or other sweet things that capture your imagination: beauty, nature, time away from work or your usual routines, or creative pursuits. New friends may enter your circle.
**As a person:** Idealistic and dreamy, artistic and sensitive, this Knight is a true romantic. His arrival in a reading shows a love prospect and even a proposal-which is wonderful if you have an established relationship. However, as a new love interest, tread carefully. This Knight is an idealist and, while wanting a relationship, finds it hard to articulate his true feelings. He may be stuck behind a persona of the perfect partner-gallant and generous-but unable to drop the act to let you see who he really is. While this is understandable in the early days of a romance, if the actions don't match the words of passion, take care; don't be swept away just yet.
As the ""you"" card in a reading: Be open to real love; judge not by appearance.
As an influence: If two or more Knights fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Knights: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed
* Three Knights: Men meeting up
* Four Knights: Lots of action; events speed up","### REVERSED MEANING

The Knight reversed means disappointment—an offer that at first glance appeared perfect does not materialize, leaving you feeling confused and pushed out. As a person, the reversed Knight is untrustworthy and unreliable. He is hooked on the chase, the romantic or sexual ideal, but has no intention of going beyond the honeymoon phase of a relationship. He may also be looking for the thrill of new romance elsewhere, continuing the cycle of manipulation.

This card often appears in a reading to denote a lover who has intimacy and commitment issues. His behavior may be inconsistent and unpredictable, but when challenged, he may protest that this is not the case and try to deflect the problem onto you. It is of course best for you to step away, as this knight has little to offer other than ongoing drama.",Knight of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,601,3534

**Element:** Water of the suit of Water
**Astrological Associations:** Gemini and Cancer
**Chakras:** Sacral, heart, and third eye, for creativity, love, and second sight
**Key Meaning:** An intuitive woman
### UNDERSTANDING THE QUEEN OF CUPS
The Queen of Cups can be considered as an aspect of card III, The Empress, or a mother archetype who brings love, kindness, and abundance. She respectfully holds up her treasure, an ornate golden chalice. With a cross atop it and two praying angels fixed on either side, it is a signifier of faith and spirituality. The chalice is closed, suggesting the sacredness of the womb and the creation of life.
On the card are three water-babies: one holding the prosperity symbol of the fish and the other two a pair, like the Queen's sign of Gemini, sitting on each side of the throne top. The water-babies signify the Queen's maternal instinct. The choice of water-baby and beach may have been inspired by a Victorian tale still popular in the period during which the Rider-Waite cards were created.
Charles Kingsley's novel *The Water-Babies: A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby* (1863) tells the story of Tom the chimney sweep, who is taken by fairies and turned into a water-baby. Kingsley tells the reader we must be open-minded to the existence of such things and that we know but ""the very smallest"" corner of the world-which can be likened to ""only a child picking up pebbles on the shore of a boundless ocean."" Perhaps the Queen is sitting at the edge of Kingsley's boundless ocean of knowledge, and the pebbles at her feet signify the elements of wisdom that come our way, washed up on the shore. These physical pebbles are repeated as a design on the Queen's crown and as a cluster on the chalice. They look like golden nuggets, symbols of her generosity.
The card's element is Water of Water, for intense emotions. The throne's scallop shape reflects this Water element, echoed in the scallop brooch fixed at her heart, pink for love. The scallop echoes Botticelli's *The Birth of Venus* (1486), which shows the goddess rising from the sea on a scallop shell-linking our Queen with Venus/Aphrodite, goddess of earthly and divine love. The fish-scale cloak falls into the water at the Queen's feet, while water-swirls decorate the lower segments of the throne so she appears as one with the water. Even the plait of the Queen's hair is scale-like, and the color is auburn, just like Botticelli's Venus.
Queens and Kings in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the Queen as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As a person:** The Queen of Cups predicts the positive influence of an intuitive, sensitive woman. She is nurturing and compassionate, with high emotional intelligence. Her work may be artistic, and she may also be drawn to medicine, caregiving, complementary therapies, certain types of sales work, or research in nonmainstream subjects. Given her sensitivity and natural empathy, this Queen has to choose her close friends carefully-but when she makes a connection with a person, she treasures him or her, just like her chalice. This card often comes up in readings to show the ideal female partner, who is unafraid of intimacy while having stability and appropriate boundaries. It can predict motherhood and children, too.
**As the ""you"" card in a reading:** Loving and giving, you make the world a better place.
**As an influence:** Love and happiness are foremost-falling in love, loving behavior, and emotional honesty. All you need to do is follow your heart. Creative projects are favored, too. Pay attention, also, to your dreams, which hold messages for you.
If two or more Queens fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Queens: Rivalry
* Three Queens: Helpful friends
* Four Queens: Women meeting up","### REVERSED MEANING

When the reversed Queen of Cups appears, you suffer emotional or financial pressure. There may be jealousy in a relationship, and most negatively, the card in this aspect can show that someone is unfaithful. As a person, the reversed Queen has obsessive tendencies, competes for attention, and needs to have her own way at all times. She drains those around her, so try not to facilitate her needs. She is not one to commit to love or contribute financially.",Queen of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,663,3941

**Element:** Air of the suit of Water
**Astrological Associations:** Libra and Scorpio
**Chakras:** Heart, third eye, and solar plexus, for love, intuition, and wisdom
**Key Meaning:** A charismatic man
### UNDERSTANDING THE KING OF CUPS
The King of Cups can be considered as an aspect of card IV, The Emperor, or a father archetype who brings structure, order, and authority. His realm is the emotions.
He sits on a throne in the sea or ocean, comfortable but rock-steady despite the stormy outlook-the sailing ship on the horizon is listing in high winds, and waves are rising against a sky of white-gray. His throne is shell-shaped and, given this King's apparent cool despite his isolation, echoes Greek god Triton, the merman who blew through a conch shell to control the rise and fall of the waves.
His emblem is the fish, for prosperity and faith, or passion, worn as an amulet around his neck; a small dolphin or fish also leaps into the picture from the left. The water is green, turquoise, and gray-the many colors of the emotions. On his crown are waves and red jellyfish. The jellyfish may be an apt reference to one of the King's zodiac associations, Scorpio, a sign renowned for its deadly sting. The jellyfish may also link with the King as Perseus, the Greek god who beheaded the Gorgon Medusa-""the ""medusa stage"" is a term describing a stage of the jellyfish's development. Jellyfish pulsate to move but have little power to propel themselves on their own, so they also symbolize acceptance and trust.
The card's element is Air of Water, for steam and clouds. As water evaporates with heat, so the King can convert Water to Air, transmuting feelings to ideas-the shift from heart to head. Like Triton, he is master of the waves and master of his emotions. This Air-Water combination can be challenging, however, as the King strives to find a balance between sharing his feelings and holding back.
Kings and Queens in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the King as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As a person:** The King of Cups shows a warmhearted, charismatic male. He might be an academic, lawyer, advisor, businessman, scientist, or artist. In his work, he follows his intuition. In friendships, he is sociable, but, like his counterpart the Queen of Cups, is sensitive and needs to choose his closest friends wisely. For this reason, he may have one or two confidants and a wide circle of acquaintances. While being empathic, at times he tries to control his feelings and can come across as distant. He often needs time to process his intense emotions before sharing them.
This card often comes up in readings to show the ideal romantic partner, who is unafraid of intimacy while having stability and appropriate boundaries. It can predict fatherhood and children, too.
### As the ""you"" card in a reading: Follow your heart.
### As an influence:
A need exists to settle a conflict, either within yourself or between you and others, usually in a work or family situation. You are unsure whether to be logical or left-field, to go with the consensus or go with a hunch. If in doubt, follow your intuition and let your heart rule. In negotiations, use all your charm and empathy. When others feel that you are really engaged with them, they will drop their defenses and communication will improve.
If two or more Kings fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Kings: A good partnership
* Three Kings: Influential men
* Four Kings: A power battle","### REVERSED MEANING

The reversed King reveals emotional vulnerability. If this applies to an individual in your life, you may be dealing with someone who is volatile right now. This person may be secretive, ashamed, and uncommunicative when not blaming others for their predicament. Thankfully, this situation is temporary and will change.

An additional meaning of the reversed card is a person with destructive behavior patterns and possibly addiction issues (see also card XV, The Devil, page 90).",King of Cups,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,628,3648

The Suit of Pentacles
**Element:** Earth
**Astrological Associations:** The Earth signs-Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn
**Number:** 1
**Tree of Life Position:** Kether, the sphere of divine light
**Key Meanings:** Prosperity, property, and beginnings
### UNDERSTANDING THE ACE OF PENTACLES
A hand appears from a cloud, offering a single golden coin. It is the only card of the suit to show a coin with a double border, as if to emphasis its value. The scene below the coin and hand depicts cultivated lilies and a rose garden with an arch forming an oval window looking onto a mountain view. This is wealthy land, where the owners can afford to grow their own lilies, symbols of purity. The clear view beyond the roses to white peaks signifies challenge and the ambition to succeed without hindrance. The message, though, is that this wealth is being offered to us, the holder of the card. The perfect garden, abundant with beautiful blooms, is an example of the prosperous lifestyle that the gift of the Ace may bring. The coin is offered with the right hand, the hand of giving (as opposed to the left hand, which traditionally is the receiving hand).
The golden coin is engraved with the symbol of the pentagram, which appears on all the cards of this suit. The pentagram is an ancient symbol for the four elements, plus the fifth element, or quintessence-the magical element of ether (see card I, The Magician, page 34). The arrangement of the pentagram points can also represent heaven over the earth. Heaven is represented as the uppermost point of the pentagram, which also links with the card's Tree of Life sphere, Kether, for the divine light of God, or great spirit. The five points can also symbolize the body's five senses, which relate to the cards' element of Earth, which is concerned with our physical experience in the world, as well as wealth and productivity.
The Aces offer the pure energy of their suits. As number ones, they represent oneness with the divine spirit or God. Indivisible, their energy is singular, strong, and purposeful. They all represent beginnings, impulses, and new possibilities, in the most pure and obvious form.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright meaning of the Ace of Pentacles is auspicious for every aspect of your life. In a spread, it overrules other minor arcana cards close by (just like XIX, The Sun). The Ace predicts happiness and contentment; you can have what you desire. Traditionally, it predicts prosperity, and you find money comes to you quickly, either as a windfall or win, or you are shown the way to achieve it. In this sense, the card presents an opportunity for further attainment, so now is the time to receive the precious gift or opportunity on offer and use it to maximize your potential. You may find a way to use it to build for the future, as property is favored in the suit of Pentacles. In readings, it commonly arises to show money is coming or a new property; it also predicts foundation and stability, so if you have questions concerning your home or relationship, you will receive what you need in abundance. One message of the card, too, is not to doubt your good fortune. You deserve it. In a reading, one Ace brings a focus on the life area according to the suit, which can set the theme of the reading. If two or more Aces appear near each other in a reading, it means as follows:
* Two Aces: An important partnership
* Three Aces: Good news
* Four Aces: Excitement, beginnings, and potential","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Ace reverses, it reveals greed and holding fast to one outcome. This desperation can cause materialistic thinking, and when you are fixed to one goal, other aspects of your life may suffer. The card can show unwise investment of time or money, so be aware of the motives of those you invest with or work for; this can be a difficult time when you are treated unfairly by an unscrupulous person or organization. Money for work you have done may not materialize. The reversed Ace of Pentacles also shows financial mismanagement and mistakes; as a prediction card in a reading, it advises not to make major financial decisions at present.

In personal relationships, the card can show that someone close becomes grasping and materialistic and selfishly wants to keep everything for themselves. The card can also show gambling and reckless spending.",Ace of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,607,3493
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_two_of_pentacles,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## TWO OF PENTACLES
Element: Earth
Astrological Association: Jupiter in Capricorn
Number: 2
Tree of Life Position: Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom
Key Meaning: Negotiation
### UNDERSTANDING THE TWO OF PENTACLES
A young man appears to be dancing, holding two coins joined on a green thread in the shape of a figure-eight, for infinity and the continuity of life. The same symbol appears in card I, The Magician, and VIII, Strength, and stands for balance, activity, and renewal. The flow of this never-ending symbol also suggests consistency and patience. In the case of the Two of Pentacles, the youth's concern is cash flow; he appears to be dancing but is actually juggling his coins to respond to changing circumstances, shown by the two boats in the background that rise and fall on the waves.
At this point, he is considering two options. He needs to be practical and use his head to make a decision and find balance, which is symbolized by his tall red hat-at the moment, his dilemma is all in his mind and he has yet to take action. Hats of this style, known as acorn hats, were worn by artisans and courtiers in the fifteenth century but were usually shorter than that of our coin-dancer. It seems his hat was purposefully elongated by the card's artist, Pamela Colman Smith, to emphasize thinking, although another interpretation may be self-delusion, or big-headedness, which is evidenced by the reversed meaning of the card.
Two is the number of partnership, and in the Two of Pentacles, the focus is on two people or two opposing forces. The continual tension between these two forces keeps the coins spinning on the figure-eight, so the situation perpetuates. When a decision is made, the tension evaporates.
On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom and the father, echoed in the phallic hat of the young man on the card. He needs to decide between two options or courses of action, and to do this, he needs to draw upon his wisdom.
The astrological association of Jupiter in Capricorn reveals strength and resourcefulness. The challenge of this combination for the Two of Pentacles is the pull between paying close attention to immediate detail and stepping back to see the long-term impact of the actions he takes.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
In the upright position, the card shows making a decision and in particular, managing money. There may be temporary cash-flow issues, and you'll need consistent effort to balance the books. If your income is up and down, an unexpected expenditure can hit hard; this is a common card for freelancers whose income varies from month to month, as well as for two people in business together. On a more positive note, the card says that if you pay close attention to financial and property matters, you will manage well, even on a tight budget. As a personality trait in the person/situation position in a spread, the Two of Pentacles indicates fairness and a willingness to find a good balance between work and personal life. In readings, the card often comes up to show two properties and sometimes making a decision about where to live-in particular, a choice between home and a property abroad. This may also reveal a choice between two jobs in different places and weighing the pros and cons of each offer. An additional meaning is news that comes in writing, so you may receive an important letter or email.","### REVERSED MEANING

In the reversed position, egotism and pride can get in the way of practicality. Irresponsible spending may cause hardship, and these financial mistakes may be hidden—gambling is a common meaning here, as well as a generally reckless attitude toward money. In work, you may be dealing with an unreasonable boss who is unrealistic about what can be achieved, putting you under needless pressure. The card can also show the ending of a business partnership due to financial difficulties; one of you may be investing more resources into the business than the other. The message is to observe closely just how committed you and your colleagues are and if the contribution is fair and equal.",Two of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,586,3420

Element: Earth
Astrological Association: Mars in Capricorn
Number: 3
Tree of Life Position: Binah, the sphere of understanding
Key Meanings: Enterprise and success
### UNDERSTANDING THE THREE OF PENTACLES
The Three of Pentacles shows a stonemason at work on a church, following a plan held up by a figure clad in a strange orange cloak. Symbolizing lifelong vocation, a monk stands by, observing the work on his building. Our mason stands on a workbench, similar to that shown on the Eight of Pentacles; both the Three and the Eight show a craftsman at work. The man in Eight has finished his apprenticeship and graduated into the Three, the qualified craftsman who works independently. The three coins are a part of the church's design; his ideas are embedded in the structure of the building. His contribution will be lasting, set in stone.
The mason is working by a half-open door, signifying that his good work and reputation will open doors for him in the future. He wears a tunic of rich purple, the color of high office in the church, to show that he is spiritually in tune with his talents and beliefs. This also aligns with Binah, his Tree of Life sphere, which means understanding. He fully comprehends his brief and knows how to direct his skills to best effect.
It's also notable that the mason appears in a public space, where he can be seen. He is proud to show his work, and the art he creates is accessible to all-which is more important than the money he will be paid. Of note, too: This is the only Pentacles card that shows the coins in black; they are a representation of lasting satisfaction rather than a reward of literal golden coins.
In numerology, three is a dynamic number (see also card III, The Empress, page 42). We can interpret this as mother, father, child-with the mason as the mother (of his own inventions); the father, the mentor of his apprenticeship; and the child, the work the mason creates.
The Three of Pentacles is associated with Mars in Capricorn, which highlights strong ambition and often applies to people who are self-starters. The challenge with this combination is to avoid obsession and sidelining other life aspects with their drive to succeed.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright meaning of the Three of Pentacles is rewarding work. It often shows you are ready to let your talents shine in public, and the card often appears in readings to show launching a business, receiving a commission, giving a lecture or teaching, or presiding over an important event; specifically, it can also show making a speech at a graduation or wedding, for example.
In domestic affairs, the card can predict building or improvement work to your home or putting a property up for sale. The Three of Pentacles is also a good card for creatives, predicting that projects will be finished and appreciated. The work may also be displayed in a public space.
According to tarot scholar Jonathan Dee, the Three of Pentacles is sometimes called the Architect, which means you establish a lasting enterprise, a project that ""causes you to stand head and shoulders above both friends and enemies alike."" The downside, of course, as you succeed and become visibly successful, is the touch of envy you may sense around you; it may feel uncomfortable, as you're not used to negative attention. This jealousy, as with elements of all minor arcana cards, is transitory and will not dint your confidence or harm your progress. Detractors can only make you stronger.","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Three of Pentacles reverses, work is tiresome and you may not be willing to put in the groundwork—or indeed to work at all. This may be because you feel you've seen it all before and have become cynical about finding a career that will suit, or you take on a role for the perceived glamor—or the way it is sold to you—and later realize that the work is mostly tedium. You'll need to push through the dull details or make a swift decision to move on.

Another interpretation of the card is poor planning so a project doesn't succeed. In property affairs, it can show builders who do not finish the work they begin.",Three of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,600,3503
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_four_of_pentacles,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## FOUR OF PENTACLES
Element: Earth
Astrological Association: Sun in Capricorn
Number: 4
Tree of Life Position: Chesed, the sphere of love
Key Meanings: Security, self-improvement, and holding on to money
### UNDERSTANDING THE FOUR OF PENTACLES
The male figure we see on the Four of Pentacles has set himself up as a king, complete with a simple crown and stone throne, set just a little above the town behind him. His purpose is to elevate himself socially and financially and create a stable base for his future. The red colors of his gown show he has focused his energy in practical ways to create a firm foundation for himself, and now that he has achieved this, he wears a black cloak of protection to safeguard his assets. He needs to keep this money for himself.
The components of the card are almost symmetrical, expressing his number four, for the concept of balance. However, what is notable is how connected this man is to his money. He has a foot on each on two coins, one attached to his crown, and one held tight against center of his body. Symbolically, his money grounds him (at his feet); it is literally at his heart, at the center of his being; and at the crown of the head, it reflects his mind-set and beliefs. His arms, wrapped around the sides of the coin, almost look unnaturally twisted in his effort have physical contact with every part of its curve. He has made sure that no other hand can touch it, but it has also become a part of his identity. Wearing his coin on his crown means he is proud to show he is now a person of means and has risen through the ranks of the streets in the background to become a self-made man of note. He holds the central coin rather like a wheel-a sign that he believes money makes the world go round.
In numerology, four represents stability. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the individual sphere associated with this card is Chesed, for love. In the case of this Four of Pentacles, it indicates love for possessions and a strong desire for stability-even though there may be an emotional cost, which is reflected in the reversed meaning of the card.
The Four of Pentacles has an astrological association with the Sun in Capricorn, highlighting practicality and resilience, although super-solar Capricorn can be abrasive. Positively, Sun in Capricorn traits make for strong leadership and problem-solving.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright Four of Pentacles shows the need for stability and establishing a firm foundation. If you have suffered past hardship, the Four of Pentacles shows the tough times are over, as now your work pays off. While this doesn't indicate a huge windfall (look to the Ten of Pentacles for this), you will have enough money and acknowledgment to feel satisfied. The card also shows protection of assets and traditional values. Proving a strong foundation for a growing family may be important to you now, so you may consider moving to a new home or investing in a small business that will bring you future dividends. In work, you attain a position that is very secure, so if your work is temporary, for example, the Four of Pentacles can show you being offered a permanent contract. An additional meaning of the card is the miser, as the male figure is clinging hard to his coin, but this money has come from hard work. You will value what you have achieved, and for now, want to keep it for yourself.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Four of Pentacles reveals an overly materialistic individual, a would-be king—male or female—who holds too fast to status and possessions. If this is you, try to let go of insecurity, as this can take up much of your head space—and feed an ongoing belief that you will never have enough. In work, the card can reveal that you miss opportunities because your confidence is low, and changes to your role may leave you feeling disempowered. It's therefore important to do well in any professional or educational tests now; you may need to put in more work than first anticipated.  The reversed Four of Pentacles can also suggest a person who is showy and even a little smug; in a position of power over you, you may find this individual controlling and self-centered.",Four of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,600,3388
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_five_of_pentacles,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## FIVE OF PENTACLES
Element: Earth
Astrological Association: Mercury in Taurus
Number: 5
Tree of Life Position: Geburah, the sphere of power
Key Meaning: A test of resources
### UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE OF PENTACLES
The Five of Pentacles features a snow scene showing two impoverished people suffering a harsh winter. It is reminiscent of Dickens's 1843 novel *A Christmas Carol* and its child character, Tiny Tim, a disabled boy on crutches. The beggar in the Rider-Waite deck appears to be a small grown man-an adult Tiny Tim, still struggling to survive years on. Around his neck is a bell, which in medieval times was worn by lepers to warn others of their approach. He has become untouchable and excluded from society.
The woman accompanying him is barefoot and gray-haired, wearing a red cloak. The color shows she will persist, despite their predicament-but what she cannot yet grasp is any possibility of change. The pair are fixed on surviving the elements and do not notice the window above, with its depiction of a money tree of five coins and a safe, solid property behind it. Even if the paupers could raise their heads to face the biting wind, this idyllic scene would seem a world away from their reality. The stained glass also reminds us of church windows. As the man and woman are not part of the church, and do not venture inside, there is a sense of being excluded from a spiritual community.
On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Geburah, or power; its additional meaning is destruction and cruelty, echoing the suffering of the two beggars. We might also interpret this harsh sphere as a message to relinquish our victimhood and take back our power, whatever knocks we endure.
The astrological association of Mercury in Taurus is an uncomfortable, and often incompatible, combination. Mercury is lined with speed and communication, while the influence of Taurus is slow and steady. In the Five of Pentacles, this can reveal a contrary influence that brings frustration and at times the inability to make consistent progress.
Five is the number of mankind. Five is also the quintessence, or fifth element in alchemy. The five coins on the card give us the meaning that there is still something to be discovered that is not yet obvious-like the quintessence, it is invisible now, but may be revealed later.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The traditional meaning of this Five of Pentacles is financial loss, so when it shows up in a reading, it can mean losing a job or a relationship or experiencing some other financial or emotional hardship. The positive aspect is that you find support from others in a similar position. These contacts may become good friends whom you may never have met in your usual circumstances. Consider new options, and you may discover another resource or approach that will help you see a way forward.
However, this card often comes up in readings to show a fear of poverty and isolation, rather than actual poverty. It also commonly shows a fear of losing the security of home and/or the aftermath of a relationship breakup, with one partner feeling alone and depleted. It occasionally reveals the impact of bereavement. While tarot cards do not predict death, the Five of Pentacles when in the present/situation position in a reading (rather than the future position) can reflect the feelings of sadness as a result of losing someone close.","### REVERSED MEANING

There's a moral theme to the interpretation for the reversed Five of Pentacles, in that the card asks you to examine your values. If you're clinging to objects, people, or money, what are you avoiding? Fear of change could lead you to ignore debt or become oblivious to growing tension in a relationship. Hoarding old possessions and memories shows you need to feel safe for now and don't have the confidence or the faith that you will be supported in the future—at least, just at present. As with all minor arcana cards, though, this is a temporary influence.

In relationships, you may suffer due to a partner's selfish behavior. This person doesn't want to give to you emotionally, or he or she withholds money. The card can also show you being ill-treated by an ex-partner who doesn't pay what is due.",Five of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,578,3413
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_six_of_pentacles,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## SIX OF PENTACLES
Element: Earth
Astrological Association: Moon in Taurus
Number: 6
Tree of Life Position: Tiphareth, the sphere of beauty and rebirth
Key Meaning: Property, family, inheritance
### UNDERSTANDING THE SIX OF PENTACLES
Like the figure of card XI, Justice, the young nobleman on the Six of Pentacles holds a pair of scales, and he is dressed in red, the color of energy and practicality. His mantle is purple, the color of intuition and spirituality-and a sign that he acts in good faith. He wears a blue-striped tunic-the only other Pentacle card with this stripe is the Nine, in which the woman shows one blue stripe beneath her robe. Both these cards share the virtue of generosity. Our nobleman is judicious, weighing the situation with the scales of mercy in his left hand and giving out coins with his right hand.
The two figures kneeling before him are beggars. One is wounded, wearing sackcloth and a bandage around his head; the other, young and poor, his blue cloak bearing a patch. Because of his blue, we know he is experiencing true poverty and deserves help. The men exist in a barren place beyond the city walls and its greenery, and there is nothing to succor them. The white sky gives a feeling of uncertainty-it is not yellow and joyful, nor blue, for clarity-but this wealthy man gives money regardless of what the outcome might be.
Six is the number of harmony and passivity. For the beggars, this is the ability to surrender and accept, which brings some serenity, even temporarily. The particular arrangement of the coin symbols might be a representation of the Hebrew letter Kaph on its side-Kaph means palm and what might be in the palm. On this card, the palms give and receive coins. Six also has the meaning of the past creating the present and future, so money earned or saved in the past may now be shared.
The Tree of Life sphere associated with this card is Tiphareth, the sphere of beauty and rebirth, relating to the beauty of the generous soul. The Six of Pentacles has an astrological association with the Moon in Taurus, highlighting stability with sensitivity. This means being able to be generous without patronizing the recipient and also knowing how to receive help graciously.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright card shows that money is coming to you. It may arrive as a gift or an award and may be donated by an individual rather than an organization. This allows you to pay off any outstanding debt and/or invest the money wisely in your future. If you have been struggling financially, this card is a welcome sign that your circumstances will certainly improve. Equally, the card can show that you are the benefactor, so you may help a friend in need with a temporary cash-flow problem, or you feel drawn to support a charity that is close to your heart. Whomever you choose to help, you will consider carefully his or her needs and offer the right amount to make a difference. Overall, this card brings genuine support and predicts you feeling connected and close to your usual circle of friends and family. Together, you may be exchanging small gifts of appreciation. An additional meaning is receiving help or money from a person from your past or using savings to help another person.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Six of Pentacles shows money coming to you but you cannot keep it—usually due to carelessness or theft. A traditional meaning of the card is having your purse or wallet stolen, and this message is reinforced if the reversed card is placed close to the Seven of Swords, the ""thief"" card of the minor arcana (see page 88). Guard your possessions carefully and watch what you spend so that enough money stays in your pocket. The reversed card also suggests there may be envy due to money, so monitor your attitudes and the attitudes of people around you.

An alternative interpretation is an offer of money, but it comes with conditions that are not acceptable to you. The message here is not to compromise and to say no if you need to. There will be other options.",Six of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,563,3244
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_seven_of_pentacles,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## SEVEN OF PENTACLES
Element: Earth
Astrological Association: Saturn in Taurus
Number: 7
Tree of Life Position: Netzach, the sphere of endurance, instinct, and desire
Key Meanings: Work and the potential for success
### UNDERSTANDING THE SEVEN OF PENTACLES
The Seven of Pentacles is a card of potential success. A young man considers his treasure, six coins arranged on a vine and a seventh at his feet. This is the same vine we see on the ""bounty"" cards of this suit-the joyful Four of Pentacles, luxury-loving Nine, the established Ten, and the wealthy King (see pages 154, 164, 166, and 174). Here, on the Seven of Pentacles, the vine is established, with large, healthy leaves-but there are no grapes. The plant is not mature enough yet to bear its full fruit. The man leans on his hoe, his magical object of transformation, as he painstakingly tends the land to nurture his vine. Slowly and with effort, it will bear him fruit. According to A. E. Waite, the creator of the Rider-Waite cards, ""One would say that these are his treasures and that his heart was there."" The six coins on the tree show what must be saved for the future, and the single coin represents his disposable income, or what he can spend now on himself. This is small reward for now, but there is more to come, provided he can keep going and not rest too long contemplating his situation.
Our grafter wears a tunic of red, to symbolize his energy, and blue, showing he is following his true purpose. His feet, like his vine, are firmly planted in the soil. He may be taking stock of his achievement as he gazes at his coins, but he will have to keep going if he is to see his ideas ripen and reward come. The purple mountains echo those on the Two and Three of Wands, and stand for goals and using our intuition.
The card's astrological association, Saturn in Taurus, means endeavor. The influence of the taskmaster planet Saturn leaves no room for fantastical plans and proposals-whatever you do must be grounded, organized, and nurtured with consistent effort. Netzach, the card's Tree of Life sphere, stands for endurance, so the combined astrological and kabbalistic meaning of the card is long-term dedication.
The card's number is the mystical number seven. Seven is composed of three, the number of heaven, and four, the number of earth, so the challenge is to bring heaven down to earth-to makes your dreams reality (see VII, The Chariot, page xx). In the Seven of Pentacles, this reward comes from work, work, work-and keeping your eye on the prize.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
There's a goal in sight, and you are close to achieving it-but now is not the time to stop and reflect. The Seven of Pentacles is the card of doing, not philosophizing, so keep your focus on what you want and believe you can achieve it. This effort may feel relentless, but your hard work will pay off.
The card often comes up in readings to show the need to keep the focus on your career goals or to work through a particularly tedious stage in a current project that leaves you feeling tired and deflated. You might be tired of the relentlessness of it all, but the reward will come as long as you don't falter. Also, the Seven can show saving for a home or accruing funds and clients to expand a business. In domestic affairs, the Seven of Pentacles can show there's not enough money left for the little luxuries that make all the effort of saving worthwhile. Whatever your situation, keep going-you are nearly there, and in the future, you will thank yourself for your dedication.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Seven of Pentacles means procrastination. Time is running out, so commit fully to the work you're doing or the lifestyle you have, regardless of the ups and downs—or put your energies elsewhere. This may mean considering a different job or career path. You may have become disheartened with slow—or no—progress in your work or improvement in your finances, but while you're in the doldrums, opportunities can slip away. Muster your willpower and take action now: Any decision is better than no decision at all.

An additional meaning of the card is anxiety about a loan or other financial agreement. If this is affecting your motivation, try to renegotiate terms, rather than give up now.",Seven of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,626,3539
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_eight_of_pentacles,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## EIGHT OF PENTACLES
Element: Earth
Astrological Association: Sun in Virgo
Number: 8
Tree of Life Position: Hod, the sphere of majesty and the mind
Key Meanings: Education and achievement
### NDERSTANDING THE EIGHT OF PENTACLES
The Eight of Pentacles depicts an apprentice at work. He is highly productive, and the tree, a symbol for growth, displays his creations-he works hard, and has eight coins to show for it. Dressed in blue and red, for energy and truth of purpose, he also wears a black apron, the vestment of a mason or smith. While the apron gives him practical protection during his work, the color black figuratively symbolizes protection, just like the merchant's black cloak on the Four of Pentacles (see page 154). In the Eight, the apprentice's budding knowledge and expertise will afford him protection from financial vulnerability in the future. A solid education and skill will equip him to earn the good living he deserves. While the atmosphere he works in is uncertain-the impassive gray-white sky gives no clue to future trends, unlike other cards with blue or sunny skies to set the tone-he keeps his head down regardless, attentive to his task.
The city in the background is distant, so he may have made a conscious decision to study or work away from familiar comforts. He may have traveled for work away from home, which, while not a convenient choice, shows his ambition and dedication to walk his own path.
The apprentice's work is repetitive, doing the same job over and again until he has mastered his skill. He takes pride in his work. However, he could be overly perfectionist, as one coin seems to have been discarded and left on the floor, while the others are displayed. He has high standards and needs to achieve excellence at all times. This personality trait relates to the card's astrological association of the Sun in Virgo. Virgoan qualities include attention to detail and practicality, but there is also a tendency toward self-criticism. The apprentice is analytic and mindful, linking with the card's Tree of Life sphere, Hod. Its common meaning is majesty, and in this Eight of Pentacles refers to the mastery of the mind.
The card's number is eight, which stands for stability and renewal (see also card VIII, Strength, page 62). The eights in the minor arcana, as they are nearing the end of the numbered sequence, hold all our experiences up to that point. We have past knowledge to draw upon, which gives us wisdom and enables new choices-a time to renew our skills and find a fresh direction.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
Money is on its way, often as a result of previous efforts or decisions rather than an unexpected bonus or gift. (Look to the Six or Ten of Pentacles for generosity and windfalls.) You may be offered an opportunity to gain new skills that will be profitable in the long term. You may also consider a new career direction or be working for promotion. In general, the card also reflects the need for a logical, diligent approach to your projects.
This card is often known as the apprentice. It comes up in readings to show education and gaining a qualification, particularly an undergraduate degree or diploma. The Eight of Pentacles also shows a personality aspect, so if it appears in the ""you/situation"" position in a spread, it reveals a hardworking, trustworthy, and dedicated individual who takes his or her responsibilities seriously.","### REVERSED MEANING

The reversed Eight of Pentacles can show that you're feeling trapped. This may be because you've chosen an educational course that isn't for you and doesn't develop your particular talents or reflect your interests enough to be sustainable long term. In work, you may know you're only doing the job for the money. While this may be acceptable on a short-term basis, long term it feels soul-destroying. While supporting yourself financially, it may be time to look elsewhere rather than let the situation continue.

As a prediction card, the Eight of Pentacles shows a cycle is about to come to an end, so rather than wait for this to happen, conserve your energy and direct it toward finding a new career. Don't resign yourself to your present situation if there's no sense of achievement or appreciation.",Eight of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,577,3404
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_nine_of_pentacles,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## NINE OF PENTACLES
Element: Earth
Astrological Association: Venus in Virgo
Number: 9
Tree of Life Position: Yesod, the sphere of foundation and the unconscious mind
Key Meanings: Comfort, accomplishment, and prosperity
### UNDERSTANDING THE NINE OF PENTACLES
The Nine of Pentacles is a card of comfort, luxury, and attainment. Here we have a country idyll-a manor house protected by hills and before us, a woman standing proud in her vineyard. These are grapes she has cultivated herself, shown by the two green loops holding the vines to wooden supports on the right of the card. In this rich and plentiful land, the lady of the house tends her nine coins and lays her right hand over one coin protectively. Her treasure might remind us of hay bales, harvested and piled in summer fields, their circular ends stacked like the faces of coins. Note that the piles of coins are unequal: She keeps six to her right and three to her left. Those on her right feel like hers to keep, while those on the left might be coins to give away. By ensuring she gives away less than she receives, she will maintain her standard of living.
Her hat is red, for passion and energy, and the lining of her gown is also red. This red lining offers a connection with the womb and its implicit fertility. This woman is fertile in her thoughts and tends her garden with the utmost love and care. The flower symbol on her robe is similar in form to the glyph of Venus, for her ruling planet, also the symbol for the female.
The small bird on her gauntlet is curious-its head is covered with a red hood, showing that it is temporarily tamed; wild instincts are under control. Although birds are often symbols of spirit, when domesticated or restrained, they can also signify vanity. Because the bird is temporarily hooded (rather than chained or caged), we sense that this woman is alert to the dangers of using money to exert control. She guards against materialism and egotism. Her kabbalistic and astrological associations account for this level of self-awareness. Luxury-loving, passionate Venus is tempered by Virgo's conservatism and attention to detail. The card's Tree of Life sphere, Yesod, means foundation. Yesod is associated with the Moon, ruler of the unconscious mind.
The card's number is nine, or three sets of three. Three is a dynamic number, and when multiplied by itself, symbolizes intense productivity. It also holds the message of the three aspects of the goddess (maiden, mother, and crone), as well as the integration of mind, body, and spirit. In the Nine of Pentacles, this can show that the lady's financial security feeds her mentally and spiritually, allowing her to live abundantly and give generously to others.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Nine ushers in a time of financial stability. You can feel safe in your home and proud of your achievements. At last, you can surround yourself with the material objects you love, and you may find yourself redecorating your home or tending your garden or yard. It's time to appreciate all that you have, so leisure time beckons; treat yourself to whatever makes you happy and enjoy the fruits of your work. You will be able to focus on your own needs without feeling guilty. The Nine also brings a sense of serenity and relaxation, so the card predicts you can feel at home, and at one, with yourself.
This card often comes up in a reading to show a woman of independent means who is generous and well balanced. In this way, the Nine of Pentacles is similar to the Queen of Pentacles (see page 172), although the Queen's influence is generally greater. In work matters, the card can predict financial reward, such as a bonus, for your efforts.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the card can show vanity and ego at large—the urge for material wealth gets out of control, so overspending (or dealing with a loved one's overspending) may need to be confronted. In general, the card can show financial dependence that is uncomfortable or misuse of money for selfish means.

An additional meaning is feeling that your home is somehow under threat because you are struggling with debt. Don't struggle alone—help is at hand.",Nine of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,639,3688

Element: Earth
Astrological Association: Mercury in Virgo
Number: 10
Tree of Life Position: Malkuth, the Kingdom, the sphere of experience
Key Meanings: Property, family, and inheritance
### UNDERSTANDING THE TEN OF PENTACLES
A happy couple and their dogs face each other under an archway, the formal entrance to a prosperous home. We spy a house in a walled courtyard, and there is a prominent high tower-possibly an obvious sexual symbol to show a love relationship or a signifier for the traditional, learning, and protection.
An older man looks on, seated in a thronelike chair. He is the King of Pentacles grown old, now with white hair, but still wearing his grapevine cloak (see page 174). By his presence alone, he appears to give the pair his blessing; it is now their turn to inherit the values of the family through marriage. We see three generations here, the grandfather-king, his son or daughter and their beloved, and a small child, presumably theirs or the offspring of another relative. Each generation seems quite separate from one another, but they happily share the same space.
All is in perfect balance. The ten coins on the card are symmetrical and represent the Tree of Life. The four elements are represented, too, equally. We see watery scenes on the coats of arms on the bridge; for the Earth element, there are grapevines; the woman's cloak is red, for Fire: and the sky over the bridge gives us the element of Air. All four elements exist in harmony.
In numerology, ten represents completeness and perfection. In the Ten of Pentacles, this shows happy stability, emotionally and financially. The ten coins are laid out in the shape of the kabalistic Tree of Life (see page 234)-each one representing a sphere on the tree and each sphere having an esoteric concept. The whole tree links with the card's meaning of maturity and completeness. The individual sphere associated with this card is Malkuth, for kingdom-so the Ten of Pentacles celebrates our personal kingdom or our material world.
The Ten's astrological association of Mercury in Virgo highlights practical affairs as well as the physical body. This combination also shows the ability to find specific solutions to problems.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright Ten of Pentacles shows an inheritance, generosity, and a love relationship that brings wealth and happiness-so if you are asking the question, ""Will my current relationship get more committed?"" the answer will be a resounding yes. The Ten of Pentacles often comes up in readings to show a wedding. What is even better is that the couple shares similar values and often has similar cultural backgrounds (and the two families actually like one another.)
An additional meaning is inherited property, buying a second home, or extending your current home, again with family support. At this time, you also benefit from sharing your time, resources, skills, or money to help each other out. Note that family in this context signifies those you consider family and treat as such, so this could relate to a close circle of longtime friends. This card also suggests maturity. You can interpret this in financial terms, with investments maturing, as well as in emotional terms, as the emotional maturity that comes with life experience. You may find that an older person in the family has wisdom to share in addition to resources.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Ten of Pentacles reveals communication problems in families as one generation tries to dominate another; children and parents disagree and have very different attitudes. The card can highlight contention over a specific issue, such as conflict over property or money. Equally, general attitudes toward finances may be at the heart of the problem. This card often comes up in readings to show overly strict parents who try to control their families with money. There is also an issue with status here as traditional values block freedom of expression. Older people may find it hard to accept that their children want to do things differently. In romantic relationships, money, property issues, and the demands of family get in the way of love. Ambition takes over; personal life comes second.",Ten of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,562,3385

Element: Earth of the suit of Earth
Key Meanings: Talent shines and money news
### UNDERSTANDING THE PAGE OF PENTACLES
Unlike the wary Page of Swords, the Page of Pentacles is entirely absorbed in his coin rather than in his surroundings. He holds the money lightly, like a precious object, a gift that will become an accolade, an award for his talents. Around him are low mountains, ploughed fields, grass, and trees-a landscape of plenty-and this fertile place of possibility is his natural home. Four trees in the distance tell us that his good fortune has come from seeds he diligently tended. He can admire his coin in the knowledge that he will always be supported: Turning his attention to one issue does not mean any other life aspect will suffer, and he does not need to look over his shoulder for challengers hoping for a share of his glory. In this way, the Page is the opposite of poverty consciousness. With his youthful optimism, he assumes he will always have everything he needs.
The Page's red headgear stands for energy and passion. His scarf is draped over his shoulder and extends down his back, signifying his wholehearted motivation. The yellow background and coin symbolize the intellect and solar consciousness: this Page is proud to let his light shine.
Earth of Earth is the Page's elemental association. What he achieves comes from the ground up, like the card's trees, with solid roots and foundation. He begins with a solid plan and an aim to establish something great. As double Earth, he may not be idealistic, but he is practical, sees through his ideas, and is loyal to his purpose.
Pages and Knights in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Page in a reading by working with the card's imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As an influence:** This Page reveals progress and adventure, as well as auspicious beginnings. This is a time to nurture your skills and abilities. There will be good news concerning finances, business, education, and travel. The Page of Pentacles also highlights the need for management, and in work matters, there may be an opportunity to manage people and projects. This Page often appears to show a job offer or an offer made on a property.
The card does come with an element of caution, however: There is a real need for attention to detail now and for diligence in all practical affairs, so double-check all arrangements and agreements. Also, check through your personal schedule to ensure everything you plan is realistic. The Page of Pentacles can also be a sign that it's time to attend to finances; he comes up in readings to nudge us to do our taxes and renew outstanding insurance policies.
As a person:
Hardworking and methodical, reliable and dedicated-this Page is practical and trustworthy. As a Page he is a younger person, or someone with youthful vigor. He may be starting out in the world, or in a new line of business. He may not have money now, but he has the potential to achieve great things in future, so you can believe in him and his plans; he will succeed, and he will not give up. The card can also show a young person's achievement and reward for his or her efforts in sport or education.
As the ""you"" card in a reading:
Money and opportunities beckon-you have an opportunity to establish a new venture.
As an influence:
If two or more Pages fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Pages: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed
* Three Pages: Lots of social activities
* Four Pages: A social group of young people","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Page of Pentacles is reversed, there may be unwelcome news regarding finances or property. Unlike the responsible upright Page, the card in this position means extravagance and irresponsibility rule. You may suffer due to someone else's selfish actions. This may apply to young people you live with or to friends with immature tendencies. The card can also apply to a person with a sense of entitlement who helps himself to what is yours; while this is not necessarily theft, it is underhanded.

ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_knight_of_pentacles,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## KNIGHT OF PENTACLES
Element: Fire of the suit of Earth
Astrological Associations: Leo and Virgo
Key Meaning: Improving prosperity
### UNDERSTANDING THE KNIGHT OF PENTACLES
This is the only Knight of the tarot's four minor suits whose horse is at rest, which seems at odds with the usual mission of a Knight, galloping boldly onward to fulfill a quest. The steed of the Knight of Pentacles-built more for pulling a plough than raging into battle-symbolizes a measured approach, very unlike that of the dashing Knight of Swords, who rushes headlong toward his goal. This Knight's mission is long term; he has no interest in hasty action and will work hard and long to ensure his success.
The plumes on the horse bridle and the Knight's helmet are green, the color of nature. They resemble a cluster of oak leaves, a reminder of the idiom ""From acorns great oaks come."" This gives us the meaning of investment for the future, a concept supported by the fields of rich terracotta soil; the time is right for sowing, and we might even imagine the Knight planting his coin in those furrows and waiting for money trees to grow.
The Knight of Pentacles is methodical and thinks ahead; he is fully prepared for his journey. The blanket under the saddle shows that he has equipped his horse for the discomfort of a long day's ride, and behind the saddle is a black book; he's brought something to read during rest periods or perhaps it is a notebook in which to record his progress. The card's element is Fire of the suit of Earth, and for this reason, the Knight of Pentacles has the ingredients of steady purpose-Fire energy to drive him forwards and Earth energy to help him plan and rationalize his ideas.
The Knight holds his coin in his right hand, which is the same color yellow as the sky. Like the Page of Pentacles, he sees potential prosperity all around him. His coin is not hidden, and he is clear that financial security is his central concern. The red of his tunic and the horse's bridles show he has energy, and like the other minor Knights, his blue armor shows he is true to his purpose.
Knights and Pages in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Knight in a reading by working with the card's imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).
### UPRIGHT MEANING
As an influence: Showing financial growth and good investment, this card means plans concerning property progress. With strategizing and setting a realistic goal, you will succeed. Pay attention to the practical details now, and future benefits are assured. Day to day, this Knight asks you to get through boring and routine, but essential, tasks. In work, the card can indicate more money coming to you due to a raise, bonus, or promotion, but you may need to work harder in return. An additional meaning of the card is finding a secure home, potentially with a partner.
As a person: This Knight is loyal and dependable. He is a natural protector, and security is very important to him. He may work in property or finance. As a potential partner, he has much to offer and is genuine. For some, he may lack excitement, as he plans rather than reacts; he can be slow to judge and to express his feelings, and keeps on safe subjects. Depending on what you need from a relationship, he could be a gift-your rock through thick and thin. If you crave excitement, he won't be entertaining enough to capture your heart
As the ""you"" card in a reading: Invest your time wisely. Be consistent in your efforts.
As an influence: If two or more Knights fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Knights: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed

* Four Knights: Lots of action; events speed up","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the card advises that you avoid complacency and check out all financial arrangements. The most negative interpretation of the card is financial mismanagement and misleading advice.

As a person, the reversed knight is stubborn and cannot see others' viewpoints. He is plodding and pessimistic, reluctant to take action and unwilling to go beyond his comfort zone. He may tend to be materialistic and secretive and, in extremis, dishonest.",Knight of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,697,3945

**Element:** Water of the suit of Earth
**Astrological Associations:** Sagittarius and Capricorn
**Chakras:** Base and solar plexus, for security (earthiness) and wisdom
**Key Meaning:** A reliable woman
### UNDERSTANDING THE QUEEN OF PENTACLES
The Queen of Pentacles is an aspect of card III, The Empress, or mother archetype. The Queen of Cups is the heart, the Queen of Swords, the mind, and the Queen of Wands, the soul (see pages 144, 200, 228, and III, The Empress, page 43). Our Queen of Pentacles is the physical, or material, side of the mother-the aspect that deals with money, property, and practical concerns to make our lives secure.
This Queen looks down upon her golden coin and to the earth itself, Earth being her suit element. All around her are symbols of spring and fertility-the hare, lush vegetation, flowing water, and flowers. The rose briar is also seen on card VIII, Strength, and I, The Magician-which also shares the dominant colors of red and yellow for practicality and clear sightedness. The land is part cultivated and part wild, giving the sense that work is ongoing and that the Queen is comfortable in nature and in the domain of her own garden or yard. She is pragmatic, cares for her environment, and above all, works hard to achieve long-term success. She is patient and will wait to see the fruit of her labor.
Engraved on the Queen's throne are pears. Symbols of fertility and long life, pears were sacred to the Italian deity Pomona, goddess of fruit trees and the orchard. According to Ovid, Pomona was a wood nymph-which the Rider-Waite deck's artist, Pamela Colman Smith, may well have referenced in the carving of a nymph on the right of the throne. The goat's head is the symbol for Capricorn, one of the Queen's zodiac signs, mirrored as a winged goat on the crest of her crown. The goat also appears on card XV, The Devil, and is a symbol of excess that, in the case of the Queen of Pentacles, translates as sensuality.
The card's element combination is Water of Earth. As water feeds earth and makes crops grow, this underlines the Queen's association with fertility and plenty.
Queens and Kings in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the Queen as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As a person:** The Queen of Pentacles is usually well off, generous, and supportive. She has a strong maternal instinct, is affectionate and wise-and she may be an older woman, or a younger female with wisdom beyond her years. Her vocations include public office, ecology, agriculture, politics, sports coaching, food and catering, and business-any work that benefits large numbers of people. She may be a homemaker, as she loves caring for her home and garden. She likes the good things in life and knows how to spend money well-on beautiful objects, on gifts for loved ones, and of course, on herself. She is physically affectionate and hands-on in her projects; rather than dictating from the sidelines, she will lend practical help.
In readings, she commonly shows up as a benefactor.
**As the ""you"" card in a reading:** Care for your body and your finances.
**As an influence:** In addition to practical support, wisdom, good financial management, and financial help, the Queen of Pentacles can show marriage and money coming to a couple. It is also a positive card for good health, a sensual sex life, fertility, and children.
If two or more Queens fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Queens: Rivalry
* Three Queens: Helpful friends
* Four Queens: Women meeting up","### REVERSED MEANING

When this card is reversed, finances can suffer. Money you relied upon doesn't roll in or funds are misappropriated. You may have to deal with the impact of someone's financial mishaps. This is temporary, however. An additional meaning is your home is neglected while other concerns take over.

As a person, the reversed Queen can be stubborn and unimaginative. She can be mean with money, or at the other extreme, an emotional spender. Her erratic behavior is for self-comfort, or she uses money to buy other people's affection.",Queen of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,630,3694

Key Meaning: A generous man
### UNDERSTANDING THE KING OF PENTACLES
The King of Pentacles is an aspect of card IV, The Emperor, or father archetype, who brings structure, order, and authority. The King of Pentacles is the father-aspect that deals with money, property, and practical concerns to make our lives secure.
The four bulls' heads on the King's throne stand for Aries, one of his zodiac signs, and the number four relates to his ancestor card, IV, The Emperor (see page 46), and also symbolizes the four elements. The King has his right foot on the head of a boar to show his mastery over base instincts. His foot and leg are armored, to symbolize he has fought hard for his position. This is echoed in the victory wreath under his crown, which is decorated with red flowers and fleurs-de-lis, three-petaled lilies or irises, ancient Egyptian fertility symbols. In this way, the King presides over the fruits of the Earth-the element of his suit.
The grapes and bull imagery also invite a comparison with the ancient legend of Ampelos, a young satyr loved by the Greek god of wine, Dionysus. Ampelos was savaged by a wild bull and died. Then Dionysus turned Ampelos's corpse into a grapevine and his blood into wine. On the card, vines grow plentifully around the bulls on the throne of the King of Pentacles and creep onto his robes as a pattern of leaves and red grapes-symbols of fruitfulness and success. From this, we deduce that the King plans carefully and expects results from long-term investments.
He holds a scepter in his right hand and his precious coin in his left, which rests on his knee. He is protected by a stone wall, and it seems he is stationed within castle battlements, as we can see the castle keep and towers on the right of the card. We sense he is secure and protected. The background is golden and orange, like his coin, reminiscent of late summer sky and harvest time, a symbol of abundance. The King's cowl is red, for energy and the material world; he does not rest on his laurels.
The card's element is Air of Earth, which can be interpreted as grounded ideas-the King sees through the projects he begins. Air and Earth can also be thought of as seeds borne on the wind to impregnate the earth, relating to the King's meaning of fertility and foundation for future growth.
Kings and Queens in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the King as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
As a person: A visionary man with a plan, the King will work hard for rewards and is usually well off. He is reliable and generous and offers practical support. Security is important to him, and he is happiest in a settled relationship. He needs to be a protector, and he has firm boundaries-he will not tolerate those looking to take what is his. His ideal vocations include property and building, business, accounting or any work that is number-based, as well as agriculture or land management.
An additional meaning is a generous benefactor.
As the ""you"" card in a reading: Make the most of your assets.
As an influence: Financial and property matters improve, and you enjoy success and comfort. The King of Pentacles also predicts conflicts that will be resolved. In relationships, he offers security and loyalty.
If two or more Kings fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Kings: A good partnership
* Three Kings: Influential men
* Four Kings: A power battle","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the King is greedy and untrustworthy, so double-check all financial agreements to ensure that there are no hidden catches. Debt is an interpretation of the reversed King, so turn the spotlight on your finances now to limit the damage of overspending.

**Element:** Air
**Astrological Association:** The Air signs-Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius
**Number:** 1
**Tree of Life Position:** Kether, the sphere of divine light
**Key Meanings:** Success, decisions, and beginnings
### UNDERSTANDING THE ACE OF SWORDS
A hand appears from a cloud, offering an upright sword. Circled with a crown, the image is a symbol for the card's Tree of Life sphere, Kether, for divine light, also traditionally titled as ""the crown."" Hanging from the crown are a frond of fern and a sprig of mistletoe and berries. As both plants can attach themselves to trees, the sword here becomes the tree, a symbol of everlasting strength. Above the sword hilt are six golden leaves, similar to those on the Ace of Wands (see page 207). The number six corresponds to Zain, the sixth letter of the Hebrew alphabet; its symbol is the sword. The six also links with card VI, The Lovers, for decisions-the sword's action is nothing other than decisive.
The scene beneath the sword shows blue-and-purple mountains, symbols of spiritual truths and goals. While there are no dwellings or green pastures to muse upon, growth is symbolized on the crown itself, with the mistletoe and fern, signifying the fertility of the mind; the sword therefore offers us the gift of intelligence (linking with the card's element of Air, for the mental realm) and because it is held upright in victory, a second gift of success. As with the other Ace cards and their symbols, in the Ace of Swords, the sword is offered with the right hand, the hand of giving (as opposed to the left hand, which is the receiving hand).
Aces offer the pure energy of their suits. As number ones, they represent oneness with the divine spirit or God. Indivisible, their energy is singular, strong, and purposeful. They all represent beginnings, impulses, and new possibilities, in the most pure and obvious form. In this Ace, the sword we see is double-edged-in cutting to the truth, it can defend us or turn against us. The sword is certain and strong; A. E. Waite, the creator of the Rider-Waite deck, describes the Ace of Swords as ""the triumph of force."" As the swords are part of battle, the Ace does not come without potential conflict.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright meaning of the Ace is auspicious for every aspect of your life. In a spread, it overrules any negative minor arcana cards close by (just like the major arcana card XIX, The Sun). The Ace of Swords predicts new beginnings, decisions, and clear thinking and usually relates to work and love. It heralds action, drama, and sometimes confrontation. However the Ace of Swords manifests in your life, it will bring an immediate change to your circumstances-for the better.
As a prediction card, it shows that mental agility and assertiveness will bring success. The other cards around the Ace in a reading will guide you to nature of this conquest. Be cautious, though, not to be too zealous-judge the situation and be direct, rather than abrasive, mindful of how you would want to be treated if you were on the receiving end.
In relationships, it reveals triumph over past obstacles-you win through to your heart's desire.
In a reading, one Ace brings a focus on the life area according to the suit, which can set the theme of the reading. If two or more Aces appear near each other in a reading, it means the following:
* Two Aces: An important partnership
* Three Aces: Good news
* Four Aces: Excitement, beginnings, and potential","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Ace reverses, the card can predict conflict and arguments, and you may become involved in a hurtful battle of wills. The card can also predict a contest that you cannot win, at least at present. The message is to withdraw, tend your wounds, and turn your attentions elsewhere. You may also lack confidence in your intellectual abilities just now and not feel equal to others—which is your perception, not the reality.  Another common meaning of the reversed Ace in readings is a decision going against you, such as failing a test or interview and, in more general terms, not being able to hold your ground under fire from more dominant personalities.",Ace of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,599,3490
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_two_of_swords,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## TWO OF SWORDS
Element: Air
Astrological Association: Moon in Libra
Number: 2
Tree of Life Position: Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom
Key Meanings: Time to think and a stalemate
### UNDERSTANDING THE TWO OF SWORDS
A lone woman holds two swords across her chest in a pose of self-defense. She appears to be resting from a duel and protects her heart with her weapons, as if fearful that the pain of the Three of Swords, with its pierced heart, may come. Although blindfolded like the maiden on the Eight of Swords, unlike that woman, she has taken herself to a safe space. Seated on high ground, this is her place of contemplation. Her pale robe is monastic in style, which tell us she is taking time out from the world and keeping her thoughts to herself. The rocks, partly submerged, symbolize issues yet to surface fully; but they do exist-they are part of her landscape and will not go away. Her hair is parted so that the third eye, between the brows, is visible. Temporarily deprived of sight, she ""sees"" with her intuition. The sky, graduating from gray to twilight blue, reflects a changing emotional landscape: She is in two minds, also signified by the two swords.
The figure's position-facing us, sitting squarely on a stone plinth, and holding swords-reminds us of card IX, Justice. Traditional representations of Justice in art and sculpture show this virtue personified as a blindfolded female holding the sword of justice in one hand and the scales of mercy in the other. Similarly, our Two of Swords woman must also adjudicate, but in the sphere of her own affairs.
The card's Tree of Life sphere is Chockmah, which means wisdom and links with the figure's exposed third eye. She must use her knowledge and experience to make the right decision, to choose between two possibilities. There's a further duality in the Tree of Life and the card's astrological associations. Chockmah represents the male principle, or yang, as opposed to the yin, or feminine qualities of the Moon in the card's astrological profile of the Moon in Libra. The moon, celestial body of the subconscious, joins balanced Libra. This combination reveals a tendency to keep the peace rather than act. We see a crescent moon on this Two of Swords, which echoes the moon on card II, The High Priestess, the psychic who symbolizes the divine feminine.
The waxing moon we see on the top right of the card is in its growth phase and will change shape throughout its cycle, just as our blindfolded woman goes through the process of decision-making, weighing up alternative outcomes.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Two of Swords shows thinking time before a decision. A situation has reached a stalemate, so you can view this period as a truce or a rest before further negotiation. The tendency is to protect yourself, have a little peace, and not take action. Unfortunately, this upcoming battle may not go away; resolve it now and it's done. Otherwise, the situation festers and may return.
As there are two swords on the card, this Two can reveal a person you cross swords with. It's likely that your difficult person is sharp-tongued, but don't be afraid of a lashing: Stand your ground and say what you think.
The card commonly comes up in readings to show employment issues and also time out in relationships. This may be circumstantial, due to partners living in different places; if negative cards such as the Three of Swords or Lovers reversed appears with the Two of Swords, it shows making a decision about the future of a relationship.
Whatever your experience of the Two of Swords, help is at hand in the form of supportive friends and colleagues. Listen to advice and then take the best practical steps forward.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the traditional meaning of the Two of Swords is deception and being blind to someone's manipulation. This card applies particularly to partnerships—love, friendships, and in business and your career. If you intuition is telling you that someone is dishonest, pay attention and carry out your own detailed investigation to get to the heart of the matter. There is an opportunity here to act, but the timing is sensitive; the message is not to delay.",Two of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,639,3698

Element: Air
Astrological Association: Saturn in Libra
Number: 3
Tree of Life Position: Binah, the sphere of understanding
Key Meanings: Sorrow, heartbreak, and pain
### UNDERSTANDING THE THREE OF SWORDS
The Three of Swords shows clouds, rain, and three swords plunged into a heart-to the left, to the right, and through the center. The heart is large and the swords smaller, and the effect is that of a heraldic shield, a defensive device that has been penetrated. The rain echoes the action of the swords, like headless arrows striking through the gray sky. What is unexpected in this sad card is the subtle blue sheen on the lower parts of the sword shafts, which appear at the bottom of the heart motif. Blue stands for truth-and the swords pierce to the truth, whatever the situation; in cruelty lies some kindness. Perhaps, after all is said and done, a blue sky awaits, a brighter outlook for the future.
This is one of two minor arcana cards without people (the other is the Eight of Wands), so there is no obvious action to interpret. This is intentional, in that the sole focus is the impact of the swords, giving the cards its primary meaning of pain. As creator of this deck A. E. Waite says, the card represents ""all that the design signifies naturally, being too simple and obvious to call for specific enumeration.""
Swords are of the suit of Air, but here we are dealing with emotional pain, so there is an element of Cups or Water for emotions here too. The swords lend drama to the situation, but the pain is very much in the heart rather than the head. The card's Tree of Life sphere, Binah, means understanding and compassion and represents the female principle of reception. In this sense, there is little we can do but accept the pain and surrender to it.
In numerology, three is a dynamic number (see also card III, The Empress, page 42). It symbolizes the trinity of mind, body, and soul-which, unfortunately, may all be affected when we experience deep disappointment or betrayal. The three can also be interpreted as three people in a relationship, which gives the card one of its meanings of affairs. This reflects old versions of major arcana card III, The Lovers (see The Historical Lovers, page 56), in which three people were shown on the card; a man had to choose between two lovers, hence once of its meanings of decisions and affairs of the heart.
The Three of Swords has an astrological association with Saturn in Libra. Saturn's influence is harsh and demands the truth, whereas Libra likes balance, like the sign's symbols of the scales. However, Saturn is more powerful in this combination, so the truth will come out-no matter how much it hurts. In the card's image, the swords cut right through to the heart of the matter.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright meaning of the Three of Swords is direct in its meaning and reveals the pain of truth. The clouds of doubt are cleared, and you can do nothing but face reality. This is a common card for relationship betrayal and can denote affairs or disloyalty in other life areas, such as work relationships and business dealings. On a more positive note, you do get right to the heart of the matter-any confusion is banished, and you are now in a position to begin to move on from shock, to begin the healing process and move forward.
In health, this Three can relate to heart issues that may need attention-such as blood pressure issues, circulatory problems, conditions such as agina, and very occasionally, the need for surgery. Please note that this is a message to take care of the heart and safeguard health; it is not a prediction of serious illness.","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Three of Swords reverses, the upset of the upright card is accompanied by quarrels and drama. In a sense, despite the upheaval, this gives a more positive meaning than that of the upright card, as at least feelings are expressed and some of the confusion and pain is shared and released. Those around you will understand your need to vent.",Three of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,643,3657

Key Meanings: Rest, passivity, and quiet time
### UNDERSTANDING THE FOUR OF SWORDS
Existing as it does between the Three, the card of strife, and the Five, the ""battle"" card, the Four of Swords offers welcome rest: an opportunity to recover from the stress and betrayal of the Three before the onslaught of the Five. The knight shown in this card has temporarily laid down his tools; one sword is displayed lengthwise, the hilt aligning with his head, in the sculpture as part of the tomb, to signify his identity as a warrior. The other three swords hang above him, secured on the wall, ready for him to take up when he rises. But for now, the knight is at rest, safe from attack and the demands of assault.
The stained-glass window symbolizes the world being held at a distance during the knight's period of withdrawal. The figures in the stained glass suggest a monk helping a child or devotee, embodying the medieval knight's commitment to charity. This is echoed in the knight's code of chivalry, which commits ""to give succor to widows and orphans,"" and hints at the two beggars on the Five of Pentacles (see page 156) who are also depicted below a stained-glass window, another world they cannot see and are not part of.
The stone knight is similar to those in the twelfth-century Templar Church in London, which was built by the Knights Templar, an order of charitable knights in the Middle Ages who were powerful protectors of Christianity. The knight on the card could be Baron Robert de Roos (1177-1226/27), as the hands of his effigy at Templar Church, unlike the other eight effigies displayed there, are placed in prayer position like those of the knight on the Four of Swords. De Roos took a year out to become a monk and relinquished his lands, so the monk depicted in the stained-glass window may also in fact be De Roos himself.
Number four is the number of stability and balance. In the warring suit of Swords, it denotes ceasefire; there is no need to continue a conflict. In the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the card links with Chesed, the sphere of love. This is love in the broadest sense, encompassing gentleness, harmony, and peace-just what the resting knight needs.
Astrologically, the Four of Swords is linked to the planet Jupiter in the sign of Libra. Jupiter indicates philosophy and possible solitude. Libra, however, is a sociable sign, so we have the conflicting qualities of the lone thinker with the socialite. In this way, perhaps the astrological association tells a story of the knight stepping away from his comrades to spend time at rest in contemplation, taking on the life of a monk in the church in which he takes sanctuary.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Four of Swords has the meaning of time out, so you may be taking a rest from work, a personal project, or a relationship. The card often comes up in readings in the past or present position to show taking a break from a relationship and also the need for recovery from illness or an operation. Commonly, as a prediction card, the Four of Swords shows recovery from stress, so the message is to conserve your energy and take quiet time if you can. The solitude of the Four of Swords can also apply to meditators and lightworkers and any individual following a spiritual path. You may need more mental space and private time than usual, so in this sense, the card is a nudge to take some alone to recharge. An additional meaning of the card is counseling or therapy and, rarely, attending a memorial service.","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Four of Swords reverses, the time-out message is enforced—so you may have to take time away from work or other responsibilities due to influences out of your control. Unfortunately, there is little you can do to alter this situation, so you must surrender to events. This is a phase, and the message is to find peace. Use the time positively. You may need to rethink your working arrangements or come to terms with changes in a relationship, particularly if you live apart from a partner or potential love.",Four of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,638,3630

### UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE OF SWORDS
The Five of Swords shows a young man holding three swords, two hoisted proudly at his shoulder and one held downward, by the hilt, as if to stake his territory. Two swords are cast down on the beach, surrendered by the retreating figures. Rather than having dignity in victory, however, the young man appears to be grinning, perhaps taking sadistic pleasure in his opponents' defeat. The defeated figures have their backs to us, unable to face their challenger again, and the one on the right has his hands to his face in shame. The clouds tell the story of the conflict that has just ended-they are gray and slashed, like torn fabric.
The youth wears red, for energy and vitality, and green, the color of nature. First, this tells us about his personality: Red reflects his energy and ego, and green, his sense of natural entitlement-not just to take his challengers' weapons, but to enjoy their humiliation. The green can also symbolize his greenness in the ways of the world. He is yet to learn the karmic lesson of ""what goes around, comes around."" Second, if we see ourselves as the victims, we can interpret the red and green as symbols of growth and the wisdom gained from the experience of conflict. This also links with the card's number, five, the number of mankind and our physical experience on the earth plane. Five is also the quintessence, or fifth element in alchemy. In the Five of Swords, the quintessence is experience or what we gain from the aftermath of battle. This is symbolized on the card by the blue sky behind the slashed clouds and the calm waters of the sea: The storm is abating.
On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Geburah, or power, which means conflict and judgment-in this Five of Swords, it reveals the need for power and control, the impetus behind the battle. Geburah is ruled by the planet Mars, known as the war-bringer.
The astrological association of Venus in Aquarius gives the meaning of idealism, one of Aquarius's attributes, with sensitive, romantic Venus; one interpretation is unconventional choices; it may also reveal a clash of fantasy and pragmatism. This is reflected in the card's upright meaning to retreat when battle is done, rather than continue to fight in a war that cannot be won.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The traditional meaning of this Five of Swords is battle and loss. It often shows family disputes, conflicts with managers, and also being the victim of ""the system""-specifically, educational boards and government and educational bodies. In relationships, the card predicts tension and conflict. Overall, the Five of Swords reveals ongoing stress, continual challenges to your position-and, often, defeat.
However this disruptive Five of Swords manifests for you, the overriding message is that all is not lost. You may not win the battle, but you can recover and walk away with your self-respect-provided you make a gracious exit at the right time. There's a danger here that you continue the fight even when the battle is over. Regardless of the provocation, deal with your anger and disappointment. There's a saying, ""It's all over, bar the shouting."" Don't keep shouting too much longer or hope to revisit the situation or relationship. It's done.","### REVERSED MEANING

The Five of Swords reversed shows unnecessary conflict; you could become caught in the middle of another person's fight, and you may be the injured party through no fault of your own. This battle is not for good reason. Whoever initiates it has a selfish agenda; this person may be trying to cover up his or her incompetence at work, blaming others to deflect attention; equally, the drama may be due to ego and a need to make a show of power. In this sense, it can be easier to extricate yourself because you know the battle is less personal.

An additional meaning of the card is bullying and oppression. There is no shame in this—rather, the card suggests finding an opportunity to expose the unfairness and to shift the balance of power.",Five of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,583,3468

Element: Air
Astrological Association: Mercury in Aquarius
Number: 6
Tree of Life Sphere: Tiphareth, the sphere of beauty and rebirth
Key Meaning: Moving on
### UNDERSTANDING THE SIX OF SWORDS
The Six of Swords is one of the more positive Swords cards, along with the winning Ace (see page 176) and the peaceful Four (see page 184). In this card, there are battles, blindfolds, or stress: A ferryman is steering a boat to a promising destination with gentle hills and trees. We see the water on the right of the boat is choppy, whereas the water before him is calm. The troubled water symbolizes a rough situation he is moving away from and the still waters ahead, a period of serenity away from strife.
He is accompanied by two passengers, a child and a shrouded figure, perhaps the child's mother. All three figures face away from us, suggesting they are fixed on their destination; the decision to leave has been made, and the journey has begun. This determined focus is a feature of the card's astrological association, Mercury in Aquarius, which also suggests a rational approach that is in keeping with Swords, the suit of the mind. The card's gray sky is neutral, so there is no emotion here; the ferryman is a neutral actor, too, paid for his services without any attachment to the outcome. The card's Tree of Life sphere, Tiphareth, means beauty and rebirth, offering a happy new beginning for the ferryman's passengers. One further aspect to note is the traditional role of the male ferryman as active and the female passenger as passive. The presence of male yang and female yin energy in balance suggests peace and harmony, which chimes with the card's numerological association.
The number six stands for serenity and peace. The six-pointed Star of David comprises two triangles, representing the concept of heaven on earth-a reminder that we can realize the heavenly and spiritual aspects of ourselves in our daily lives to enjoy harmony in mind, body, and spirit. In the Six of Swords, the two themes are the present and the future. The challenge is to integrate our experiences and move forward.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Six of Swords shows you moving on from a situation or relationship and enjoying a period of peace and harmony. This may manifest mentally rather than physically, as you take a more detached approach, distancing yourself from drama and complication. This gives you an opportunity to rest and recharge; it may lead you to explore a new environment or make a spiritual discovery.
In work, the card can show travel as part of your role (and respite from the office or other workplace), and in relationships, the card commonly shows two people spending time apart. More negatively, the interpretation is a relationship ending (look for accompanying cards such as the Three of Swords or the revised VI, The Lovers, for validation). This ending may be positive or negative, depending on your situation.
On a more literal note, the card can simply show taking a break from work or your usual environment, and you may travel, possibly on a trip overseas. When the Six of Swords appears with major arcana cards VII, The Chariot, for progress and XIII, Death, for transition, a more permanent move is suggested, so the combination can be interpreted as emigration or a long period of travel. If we see the three figures on the card as a family rather than ferryman and passengers, the card suggests a major move for two or more people.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Six of Swords has a meaning that is similar to that of the upright card. It reveals a need to escape, but your plans are delayed. It may not be the right time for you to travel or leave an unsatisfying situation, as certain problems need to be addressed and resolved before you can be free. However, check that your intentions are sound and that you're looking in the right direction; rather than fixating on a particular outcome, which may blind you to other possibilities, keep your plans realistic. You may feel frustrated now by lack of progress, but stay focused and grounded and your time will come.",Six of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,596,3477
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_seven_of_swords,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## SEVEN OF SWORDS
Element: Air
Astrological Association: Moon in Aquarius
Number: 7
Tree of Life Position: Netzach, the sphere of endurance, instinct, and desire
Key Meanings: Theft and dishonesty
### UNDERSTANDING THE SEVEN OF SWORDS
A smug thief makes off with five of seven swords while an encampment is unguarded. The inhabitants are silhouettes, engrossed elsewhere while their weapons are stolen. This seems an easy take-the tent doors are open, and their bright colors make them attractive to the passerby. The thief knows he is safe with his hoard and gives a sarcastic smile as he looks back at the site, knowing full well he will not be discovered. The card's bright yellow background symbolizes consciousness, so this thief does not operate in secret under cover of night. He commits daylight robbery.
His dress is ostentatious. His red, fur-trimmed boots and matching hat give the impression of someone with a sense of entitlement to the best things life has to offer-except, he is willing to possess them by illegal means. The red symbolizes energy, ego, and the material world. Red on his feet suggests he will act on his ego to get what he wants. Note how his boots and hat don't fit with the rest of his outfit; perhaps they are stolen, too, as they make a sharp contrast with his everyday leggings and basic drawstring shirt, the clothes of the common man-or common thief.
One question remains, however. Why does the thief leave two swords behind? The two remaining swords highlight one of the positive meanings of the card, in that the victims may still defend themselves, even when their opponent has the advantage. The thief takes with him just five swords. Five in the minor arcana is also the number of upheaval-the Five of Swords, conflict; the Five of Pentacles, money issues; the Five of Wands, challenges; and the Five of Cups, loss.
The card's Tree of Life sphere is Netzach, which means endurance and instinct. These are the qualities the potential victim will need to uncover the identity of the thief; they are also the personality of the thief himself, in his willingness to take risks. He is also able to wait patiently for the right moment to strike. Further qualities are revealed by the astrological association of the Seven of Swords with the Moon in Aquarius, which blends the Moon's intuition with Aquarius's idealism and detachment.
The number seven is a mystical number. It was sacred to the god Apollo, founder of the famous Delphic oracle, and is the number of the days of the week, the deadly sins, and the wonders of the world (see Understanding The Chariot, page 58). Seven represents possibilities, as it comprises three, the number of heaven, and four, the number of earth, and so shows the potential to bring heaven down to earth-to manifest an ideal. However, in the Seven of Swords, the thiefs idea of heaven on earth has moral implications.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The common name for this Seven of Swords is the thief. Traditionally, the message is to protect your belongings and property. In general, we can think of this as a potential transgression-you may encounter a challenge to your position, an individual invading your space, or in relationships, a selfish partner who takes too much emotionally, or at worst, defrauds you. As the suit of Swords relates to intellect, you'll need your instincts and your wits to discover the truth. You may need to be devious and play this person at his or her own game, too, to find out what you need to know. Your opponent may be strong, but you still have valuable resources on your side. The card can also show legal problems, and unfair or fraudulent business dealings.","### REVERSED MEANING

The reversed Seven of Swords shows a tendency to give up rather than take a stand. It may feel unnatural to you to think like your opponent to anticipate their next moves, but this attitude will help you defend what is yours. Otherwise, you may surrender too soon. This particularly applies to work, when a colleague tries to disempower you. It's important to stand your ground. As with the upright card, the reversed Seven of Swords can show legal problems of and in business dealings, beware of unscrupulous people.",Seven of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,628,3665
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_eight_of_swords,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## EIGHT OF SWORDS
Element: Air
Astrological Association: Jupiter in Gemini
Number: 8
Tree of Life Position: Hod, the sphere of majesty and the mind
Key Meaning: Restriction
### UNDERSTANDING THE EIGHT OF SWORDS
The Eight of Swords shows a fairytale gone bad: A maiden is outcast from a castle, and her hands are bound. She stands alone within a semicircle of planted swords, with her back turned to her home. A hostage, she is a symbol of otherness, separated from the castle, which stands for civilization and inclusion. Her red robes symbolize energy, but she is tied, so her movements are restricted. The rock pools look pretty and innocuous, but if she cannot shift her position soon, she may be in danger when the water rises with the high tide. Her eyes are blindfolded, symbolizing an inability to see a way ahead. A blindfolded woman also features on the Two of Swords, the ""stalemate"" card-so perhaps the hostage of the Eight of Swords was once the Two, but now her bonds are tighter and her situation more precarious.
Thankfully, this bondage will not last: A. E. Waite, the Rider-Waite tarot's creator, says, ""it is rather a card of temporary durance than of irretrievable bondage."" At some point, our maiden will muster the determination to save herself; no prince on a white charger will come.
The astrological association of this Eight of Swords is expansive Jupiter in sociable Gemini, a highly creative and intellectual combination. The challenge is to manage information overload, as ideas can go too far, leading to potential failure due to a lack of perspective and focus-a link with the blindfolded hostage, the card's central image.
The card's number is eight, and one of its meanings is change, renewal, and stability. This reflects the hostage's need to extricate herself from thoughts that are keeping her trapped and to find new ground. As Swords are the suit of Air, which rules the mind, this also links with card's Tree of Life sphere, Hod. Its common meaning is majesty, and in this Eight of Swords, refers to the mastery of the mind.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright card shows feeling trapped. This may be due to a series of bad experiences and poor luck, and you begin to wonder if things can ever improve. You may be anxious due to an unsatisfactory bond with an individual or an organization; specifically, you may be trapped by a credit agreement that leaves you little money for yourself.
This unfortunate Eight of Swords commonly reveals problems in careers and the intellectual or mental realm, showing frustration and, at its most extreme panic. Hemmed in and unhappy, you may be finding it impossible to do your work to your satisfaction due to unreasonable demands or disorganized management. Also, there may be a sense of conversations going on behind closed doors that you are not party to, so you feel isolated and even vulnerable. The card commonly arises in readings to show someone who is in a role that doesn't suit them, but they are under pressure to conform-such as working in the family business or taking a course because it will lead to a profession, although it isn't what they love doing at all. Many creatives and lightworkers go through this experience of not fitting in, but it takes time and confidence to find your path. You can release yourself from these bonds, but it will take determination, and you may need to swallow your pride and ask others for support and advice. On a social level, the Eight of Swords can show you feeling humiliated or ignored, and you fear others attitudes toward you. An additional meaning of the card is illness and incapacity. Again, this does not imply permanent disability, but a phase of physical restriction.","### REVERSED MEANING

In the reversed position, much of the upright meaning applies, except that it is often accompanied by strong emotions such as guilt, anger, and regret. It’s likely you’ll express these feelings in negative ways, however, because you are so frustrated; try not to lash out on whoever is closest. As with all the minor arcana cards, the Eight of Swords shows a phase that will not last.",Eight of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,635,3706
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_nine_of_swords,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## NINE OF SWORDS
Element: Air
Astrological Association: Mars in Gemini
Number: 9
Tree of Life Position: Yesod, the sphere of foundation and the unconscious mind
Key Meaning: Anxiety
### UNDERSTANDING THE NINE OF SWORDS
The meaning of the Nine of Swords, like many of the cards of the suit, is obvious at first glance. An anguished figure sits upright in bed, awake in the night in clear distress. Nine horizontal swords appear behind and above the figure, like bars at a window. Swords represent the intellect and thoughts, here en masse as a symbol of restriction; their hilts are crossing, crowding the space like unwanted thoughts. The third sword from the bottom crosses the crown of his head, oppressing him; the second sword from bottom strikes through his head; and the lowest sword appears to cut through the area of his heart. What began in the mind now hurts him at a deep level, and he is cut off from usual sources of comfort in a painful internal struggle.
The mattress is a pale purple color, the color of intuition, linking with the card's Tree of Life sphere Yesod, which is ruled by the Moon, ruler of the unconscious mind. The pastoral scene carved on the side of the bed or couch is suggestive of dreams, but the two figures depicted are not at peace; there is an aggressive current to the image. A figure is brandishing an implement at a prone figure, indicating that the dreamer is a victim of his thoughts.
In contrast to the dark feel of the card, the quilt is bright and beautiful, showing the twelve glyphs of the zodiac signs with alternating patches of red roses. The glyphs represent multitude-rather than having any individual significance, they tell us that the person's worry may encompass lots of life aspects. The red roses are a symbol of love and hope. The dreamer cannot see this just now, as his hands are covering his eyes, much like the two beggars on the Five of Pentacles, who cannot see the money tree depicted in the beautiful stained-glass window about them.
The card's number is nine, or three sets of three. Three is a dynamic number, and when multiplied by itself, symbolizes intense productivity-however, in the suit of Swords, the mind is overproductive, awash with worries and negative thoughts.
The astrological association, Mars and Gemini, is a forceful combination. Free-spirited Gemini is controlled by Mars, an unstoppable, aggressive force, bringing frustration and a sense of entrapment.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
I call this Nine ""the 3 a.m. card"" because it describes the meaning so accurately: It's what you wake up worrying about in the small hours of the night, showing you are dealing with high levels of anxiety. You may have suffered an illness and the resulting low energy or a shock or a buildup of minor stresses that begin to disrupt your sleep patterns and peace of mind. External events such as these may have triggered the initial stress, but the issue now is how you are responding to it.
Look to the surrounding cards to see the life area that this relates to, although the anxiety in the Nine of Swords can reflect unhappiness in key areas, from work to relationships, coloring your usually positive attitude. The card also indicates the habit of worry-so you may be worrying about inconsequential things that usually don't warrant your attention. Thankfully, as this is a minor card, this pattern is temporary.
In work, the Nine of Swords can show feeling overwhelmed. You simply have too much to do, particularly if the card appears with the Ten of Wands, known as the burden card.
The Nine of Swords occasionally comes up in a reading to show mental health issues associated with anxiety, such as panic disorder or anxiety and depression. Insomnia and nightmares are additional interpretations.","### REVERSED MEANING

Unfortunately, as you might expect, the reversed Nine's meaning is more extreme than that of its upright counterpart and traditionally means despair, guilt, or feeling trapped. However, this is the lowest point of the cycle, and these feeling will begin to shift. As you gradually move out of this difficult phase, you will feel more able to turn these feelings of powerlessness around. Be patient and compassionate with yourself and turn to others for support rather than suffering alone.",Nine of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,645,3768

Element: Air
Astrological Association: Mercury in Virgo
Number: 10
Tree of Life Position: Malkuth, the Kingdom, the sphere of experience
Key Meaning: Endings
### UNDERSTANDING THE TEN OF SWORDS
The Ten of Swords has a black background that appears on the Nine of Swords (known as the stress card) and card XV, The Devil. We are indeed in a dark place again here, as we see a young man pinned to the ground by ten swords embedded along the length of his back. There's also a sense of shock in the card, symbolized by the blue water, purple mountains, and yellow sky set against charcoal-gray clouds, heavy with rain, in a black sky. This dual skyscape represents two worlds: the bright outlook of the ""before-world"" prior to the conflict and the ""after-world,"" in which everything is changed and a sudden darkness descends like a shroud, to eventually cover the body. The victim is facedown and does not show his face, as if he is no longer relevant; the focus of the card is the points of the swords. The victim's right hand is slightly twisted, and if we look closely, we see it makes the sign of blessing, with the first two fingers straight as in card V, The Hierophant (see page 50). In this sense, we may interpret the figure as a fallen master or guru; or this pose may be a sign of the man's acceptance of this ending-that what has befallen him is in fact a blessing. A red cloth is draped over him, and the fabric flows like blood from his body. Red symbolizes love, vitality, and, here, the life force, or blood.
In numerology, ten represents completeness and perfection. In the Ten of Swords, the completeness is an ending. The individual sphere associated with this card is Malkuth, for kingdom-so the Ten of Swords reveals an end to our personal kingdom or one aspect of our material world.
This card's astrological association of the Sun in Gemini brings a bright, sociable influence that is at odds with the card's meaning and can only highlight newfound happiness after the influence of this dark card has passed. As the sun goes down on a life phase, the Sun in Gemini offers light at the end of the tunnel.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The traditional meaning of the upright card is ruin. While this sounds frightening, it does not, however, mean death or destruction; it is also worth bearing in mind that this event, although sudden, has a history. This is not an act of God, like the lightning strike of card XVI, The Tower, but the natural outcome of a culmination of events that leads to inevitable change. This ending clears the way for new possibilities, and you may find the finality of it releases you from frustration and stress, as is expressed in the preceding card, the Nine of Swords (see page 192). In this sense, the Ten of Swords is an aspect of card XIII, Death, in its meaning of endings, transition, and new beginnings. In your personal life, bonds of friendship may break, and there may be no turning back; this, unfortunately, is unavoidable, but with hindsight, you may see that certain people in a group were causing discord and stress. In love relationships, the card signifies a dramatic ending (particularly if it appears close to the Three of Cups, the ""sorrow"" card). However, the Ten of Swords often applies to a group of people, rather than individuals. In work, this may manifest as the closure of a department accompanied by job loss or a failing business. On a more positive note, this is the end of an era; soon the strife and upset will be over. Health issues, such as low energy and exhaustion, will improve.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Ten of Swords holds the meaning of the upright card, but indicates there may be more repercussions. You may examine your past actions and feel guilty or angry and react more deeply to the fallout; try not to hold on to the stress. Accept the situation and let go. The reversed Ten of Swords can also show feeling helpless, particularly if you have been ill or overwhelmed emotionally. Soon you will feel able to pick yourself up and start over.",Ten of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,636,3570
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_page_of_swords,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## PAGE OF SWORDS
Element: Earth of the suit of Air
Key Meanings: Intelligence and contracts
### UNDERSTANDING THE PAGE OF SWORDS
A young man stands strong, sword raised in both hands and alert to the signs of trouble. The landscape is blown with clouds, and we see a lone tree almost doubled over by the wind. A circling flock of black birds suggests something is about to take flight or take form. Whatever happens, though, our hero is poised for action in unsettled times. On high ground, he has chosen the best position to fend off any enemy. He stands tall for all to see and brandishes his sword. The weapon is a symbol of his intention and his mind, which extends beyond the edge of the card itself. He is willing to deal with known and unknown threats, to plan his response and ultimately to win. While not dressed for battle-he has no armor and possibly no experience of conflict-his pose suggests he is ready to attack or defend; looking over his right shoulder away from his sword, he is alert to attack. He minds his position on both sides, a knight in training-his tunic is dark red, a regal color, symbolizing his ambition to rise through the ranks. His boots are red, for energy and matter, while his hose and sleeves are yellow, a symbol of the intellect.
The mountains beyond are blue, a color commonly used in this tarot to denote truth and spirituality (think card II, The High Priestess, and her robes, or VII, The Chariot, and its heavenly canopy of stars). Like card XI, Justice, this Page with his sword cuts to the truth, bringing clarity: The clouds disappear. Young, feisty, and confident, the Page of Swords is clear-thinking and dedicated to his cause. His element is Earth of Air. His foremost skill is his intellect and wit, so when combined with practical Earth, he is a strategist, planning the most effective action to take. The negative aspect of this Earth-Air pairing is conflict between Air's need to show off and Earth's pragmatism. If Air dominates, the Page of Swords can be precocious and superficial, losing sight of the bigger picture.
Pages and Knights in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Page in a reading by working with the card's imagery first, then the written interpretations (see also the Introduction, page 8).
### UPRIGHT MEANING
As an influence: This card denotes useful information. Your hard work pays off in business and other work dealings. The Page of Swords also suggests people around you will be helpful, furthering your ambitions. This is a time to be alert and observe carefully what others say. Be ready to take action as you as you see the right opportunity and consult others who can act as advocates on your behalf. This card often comes up in readings to say that a contract will be coming your way-regarding property, careers, travel documents, and other agreements.
As a person:
The Page of Swords suggests an individual who is charming, clever, and very good company. As he's a Page, this is often a younger person or someone with a youthful, quick-fire brain. He may be forthright with his words, but he is ultimately a good ally who can turn challenges into opportunities. Quick to learn, he is curious and open, but the downside is that he can be mischievous and so set on achieving his aims he forgets to treat others with sensitivity.
As the ""you"" card in a reading:
Rely on your intelligence.
As an influence:
If two or more Pages fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* **Two Pages:** Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed
* **Three Pages:** Lots of social activities
* **Four Pages:** A social group of young people","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, this clever Page of Swords becomes manipulative and cunning. Be cautious about information you receive now, as it may not be reliable, and be discerning about what you hear about other people, as it may be unjust and even slanderous. As a person, the reversed Page of Swords can be a gossip who seems to care little about the misconceptions he spreads. At his worst, he can be devious and unscrupulous. Ignore his needs for constant attention; don't fuel his fire.",Page of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,670,3820

Element: Fire of Air
Astrological Associations: Taurus and Gemini
Key Meanings: Stress and truth
### UNDERSTANDING THE KNIGHT OF SWORDS
Such is the force of the Knight of Swords that even his horse seems on the brink of terror as they leap toward an unseen enemy. The Knight, in full battle armor, is on the brink of war, his sword brandished, horse's reins held high, and feet forced down into the stirrups to urge the animal to keep pace. His visor is up, showing us that he is more than ready to look his enemy in the eye. The wind is against him-the trees to the left of the card bend to the right while our rider gallops to the left-a sign that he is not afraid to ride toward, not from, whatever opposes him. The desert landscape is rather bleak, a symbol for the need to survive, and the clouds are ragged, as if the Knight had sliced them to pieces. His sword extends beyond the card, like that of the Page of Swords, to suggest that this Knight's intention goes far beyond the limited landscape we see. Fixated on his mission, it feels as if nothing can stop him. The ""true blue"" of his armor and horse bridle and collar show he is prepared to cut to the heart of the enemy-or matter-at hand.
The card's element is Fire of the suit of Air. Fire, or passionate energy, is symbolized by his red cape and plume, and Air is denoted by the birds and butterflies decorating the horse's collar. The mix of air, or wind, with fire, or lightning, suggests thunderstorms and hurricanes-a surge of power that erupts then dissipates. This is the Knight's modus operandi. He charges, confronts the enemy, and then departs in a flash.
Knights and Pages in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Knight in a reading by working with the card's imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As an influence:** Unpredictable, tempestuous times are ahead-you're in for a roller coaster drama of highs and lows. Sudden truths may come to light or underlying conflicts are exposed. This may be illuminating, stressful, or bewildering, depending on your position.
The card often comes up to show disputes at work and tension within families and in romantic relationships. While you may not be responsible for the cause of the trouble, what counts now is how you recover. There is a way forward, but you may need to wait until the situation is calmer before you can make a move.
As a person: The Knight of Swords is determined and driven, and he has a strong sense of himself and his mission. He may be quirky and entertaining with an offbeat sense of humor, and he may even dress in a distinctive way. Incisive, forthright, and intelligent, he makes a strong advocate and is prepared to fight for his beliefs. The downside is that he often makes his mark, gets bored, and moves on. In relationships, he may cause drama, but takes no responsibility for reconciliation, leaving others to make peace while he's charging ahead with his next obsession. In work, he can show up in readings to represent auditors and other assessors, such as doctors and lawyers, or consultants who are hired to fire, not fix-in short, professionals who are adept at diagnoses and whose opinions matter. Ultimately, though, you are the one who will have to deal with the outcomes.
As the ""you"" card in a reading: Expect the unexpected.
As an influence: If two or more Knights fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Knights: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed
* Three Knights: Men meeting up
* Four Knights: Lots of action; events speed up","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the King of Swords means stressful situations are blown out of proportion as an individual thrives on drama but lacks the courage to take control. The card also advises that you may be let down by someone you thought was reliable and steadfast. A person with a big personality may have lots to say but have little substance. However, this individual's high intelligence means he usually talks his way out of trouble, denying any involvement.",Knight of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,675,3814

Element: Water of the suit of Air
Astrological Associations: Virgo and Libra
Chakras: Crown and third eye, for openness and intuition
Key Meaning: An incisive woman
### UNDERSTANDING THE QUEEN OF SWORDS
The Queen of Swords is an aspect of card III, The Empress, or mother archetype. This Queen is the ""mind"" aspect of the mother, just as the Queen of Cups is the heart (see page 144 and The Empress, page 42).
Our Swords Queen has a sense of sovereignty like no other-she is the only female monarch shown in profile, like a head on a coin. One hand is raised, as if to greet a visitor, and like the Queen of Wands, her pose is alert. This is a woman in charge: She holds her sword at a perfect right angle to her throne arm and sits on high ground, giving a sense of authority over her domain.
The card's element is Water of Air. We see the Water element in the river below four trees; it extends from the Queen's red veil, which flows down behind her throne. This creates the effect of a river of blood, a reminder that this Queen, unlike her jewelry, is not for show. If necessary, she will fight, and it won't be pretty.
The Air element, for the mind, is expressed through motifs of winged creatures-the single bird, the cherub, and the butterflies on her throne and crown. Her butterfly crown is open, a sign that she welcomes ideas and opinions. She is very much part of her airy landscape, wearing clouds on her cloak and white, billowing robes. The blue-sky background symbolizes her motivation to find the truth.
On her throne are two crescents: either two crescent moons or two sickles, or curved blades. As moons, they link her to the crescents on card II, The High Priestess, who deals with the hidden world of the subconscious and the sixth sense: The Queen of Swords also has sharp instincts and is not afraid to follow them. As sickles, they echo the purpose of her magical object, the sword, again linking with her element of Air.
Queens and Kings in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the Queen as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As a person:** An astute strategist, the Queen of Swords is single-minded and highly ambitious. Like her sign of Libra, she can quickly assess all aspects of a situation to get to the truth, including the underlying psychological motivation for others' attitudes and actions. Adept at numbers, she may be an administrator, IT specialist, researcher, or financial executive-the need for attention to detail relates to her associated sign of Virgo. Sword Queens also make successful businesswomen or bosses. She has much life experience and may have had hurdles to overcome in her early years. This makes her the strong woman she is. For all this, she is still willing to take risks on new experiences and relationships. She does not suffer fools gladly, but if she likes you, she will reward and trust you implicitly.
Traditionally, this card is known as the widow, but means in general a single woman or a woman who has to make her own way in the world. It's also a common card for single parents.
**As the ""you"" card in a reading:** Be determined and stand strong.
**As an influence:** The Queen of Swords offers wisdom and intelligence, perspective, and the ability to see the bigger picture. When placed closed to negative cards in a reading, the Queen shows strength in adversity.
If two or more Queens fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Queens: Rivalry
* Three Queens: Helpful friends
* Four Queens: Women meeting up","### REVERSED MEANING

Reversed, the Queen of Swords suggests excuses for bad behavior or a situation in which you are unjustly attacked. As a person, this individual can be an opponent or someone who has suddenly turned bitter and vengeful. However, a common reason for the Queen to invert can be extreme stress—this woman lacks awareness of just how unreasonable her demands have become. If this is the case, back away; she must help herself.",Queen of Swords,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,649,3661
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_king_of_swords,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## KING OF SWORDS
Element: Air of the suit of Air
Astrological Association: Capricorn and Aquarius
Chakras: Crown and third eye, for openness and intuition
Key Meaning: An ambitious man
### UNDERSTANDING THE KING OF SWORDS
The King of Swords can be considered as an aspect of card IV, The Emperor, or a father archetype who brings structure, order, and authority. The realm of the King of Swords is the mind, just as the King of Cups rules the heart, the King of Pentacles, the physical body, and the King of Wands, the soul (see pages 146, 174, 230, and The Emperor, page 46).
The King is comfortable in his regal position and resembles card XI, Justice, in his pose with Justice's sword (see page 74). Like his partner, the Queen of Swords, the King's throne is engraved with butterfly motifs, for his element of Air. On the right-almost perching on the King's shoulder-is a female fairy. The two crescents forming a crest with the butterflies at the top of the throne may be sickles, another implement that cuts like his sword. Equally, they could be two moons. One of the moons of Uranus, the planet of awakening that rules the King's sign of Aquarius, is named Titania, after the legendary queen of the fairies. If the fairy on the throne is intended to be the beautiful but cruel Titania, she embodies the dark and light sides of the King's mighty sword: This charming sovereign can be ruthless.
The card's element is Air of Air, so this King is idealistic and ambitious. His throne is placed above the base of the trees, suggesting perspective from a high position. His sword is held at an angle, rather than in upright, ceremonial pose, so we sense he is familiar with the feel of its swipe. The clouds, symbols of doubt or confusion, seem banished to the mid-and lower parts of the card, as if the King had just cut through the clouds above him, revealing a soft bluish sky. Blue is the color of truth and clarity, echoed in the color of his robes.
The King's purple cloak stands for intuition, and the red cap and orange sleeves are for passion and the material world. He focuses his sharp mind on what needs to be done.
Kings and Queens in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life, or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the King as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As a person:** The King of Swords can be an intellectual or a man who relies on logic to help him win. He is also open to ideas, although he can be impatient if he has to wait for a consensus before taking action. However, he is outwardly calm and makes good judgments. He often has a dry sense of humor and is very charming. In readings, he can appear as a seductive man you meet at work or through other professional connections.
His ideal vocations include traditional professions, and you will often find him in powerful roles: doctor, judge, solicitor, or member of the armed forces or law enforcement; academic, IT, and research work may appeal, and in business, he is often a manager or director. Whatever profession he chooses, he must be able to make decisions that make a difference, and preferably, have hands-on involvement.
**As the ""you"" card in a reading:** Take charge.
**As an influence:** When the King of Swords arrives in a reading, the focus is on the mind rather than the heart. You may be going through an intensive time of work or study. In relationships and domestic affairs, it's time to take the initiative.
If two or more Kings fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Kings: A good partnership
* Three Kings: Influential men
* Four Kings: A power battle","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the influence of the usually balanced King of Swords can be destructive. You may be put under unreasonable pressure to produce results.

ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_ace_of_wands,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## ACE OF WANDS
The Suit of Wands
**Element:** Fire
**Astrological Associations:** The Fire signs-Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius
**Number:** 1
**Tree of Life Position:** Kether, the sphere of divine light
**Key Meanings:** Enterprise, career, travel, and beginnings
### UNDERSTANDING THE ACE OF WANDS
A hand, offering a single wand, appears from a cloud. The Ace of Wands is the only card of the suit to show multiple buds, symbolizing new ventures. There are four leaves on one stem, and the two lower stems each have three leaves. A further eight leaves float around the wand, giving a total of eighteen. This may relate to the eighteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Tzaddi, meaning hope. The leaves are similar in appearance to the droplets on the Ace of Cups; the Ace of Swords; XVI, The Tower; and XVIII, The Moon (see pages 120, 176, 94, and 102).
The scene below shows purple mountains, symbols of spiritual goals. A building, a fairytale castle or a monastery, is perched on a hill-signifying the ambition to attain a dream or spiritual aspiration. The castle is isolated and protected by high walls and a tower. Seeing the strong wand grasped before us, we may view it as a club, held high in a gesture of protection and ownership of the land. In the valley, pure water flows, the blue a color for true purpose. Three trees grow on the right bank, symbols of growth and fertility.
Unlike the cultivated garden of the Ace of Pentacles, the landscape of the Ace of Wands is natural and untamed: This Ace is a true pioneer, venturing into wild new territory. In this sense, the card presents the gift of enterprise and adventure. As with the other Ace cards and their symbols, the offering is made with the right hand, the wand held with the hand of giving (as opposed to the left hand, which is the receiving hand).
The second gift of the Ace of Wands is the drive to succeed. We may have an enticing vision or prospect, but need the energy to make it happen. The card's element is Fire, full of burning purpose-just as the wand, if planted, will determinedly grow into a tall, strong tree. The card's Tree of Life sphere is Kether, for the divine light of God, or great spirit. In the Ace of Wands, this stands for the spirit of adventure.
The Aces offer the pure energy of their suits. As number ones, they represent oneness with the divine spirit or God. Indivisible, their energy is singular, strong, and purposeful. They all represent beginnings, impulses, and new possibilities, in the most pure and obvious form.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright meaning of the Ace of Wands is auspicious for every aspect of your life. In a spread, it overrules any negative minor arcana cards close by (just like the major arcana card XIX, The Sun). The Ace predicts new beginnings, enterprise, and invention and often relates to work issues and projects. It's a happy card for creative work, too. With this Ace, you experience a flash of inspiration and know what do next to give form to your concept. As you conceive ideas, so the card works at a literal level as a phallic symbol, for male virility and starting a family. An additional meaning of the card is travel and adventure, particularly when it appears in a reading with the Three or Eight of Wands (see pages 208 and 218).
In a reading, one Ace brings a focus on the life area according to the suit, which can set the theme of the reading. If two or more Aces appear near each other in a reading, it means the following:
* Two Aces: An important partnership
* Three Aces: Good news
* Four Aces: Excitement, beginnings, and potential","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Ace of Wands reverses, it can show blocks to creative projects and delays to travel. In work, a project may be abandoned or postponed due to poor management. In general, the card reveals false starts; plans need a rethink. In relationships, this Ace can reveal a lack of commitment from a man or time apart for a couple, usually due to work, and the woman finds herself waiting for the man.

Another common meaning of the reversed Ace of Wands in readings is difficulty conceiving a child, particularly if the card appears close to the Three of Swords, the card for sorrow (see page 180).",Ace of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,638,3590

Number: 2
Tree of Life Position: Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom
Key Meanings: Plans, partnership, and influence
### UNDERSTANDING THE TWO OF WANDS
In the Two of Wands, a young man holds a globe in his right hand and a wand in his left hand. The wand is held toward its base, and the man rests it on a raised section of wall so that it stands taller than his head. Altogether, these symbols offer us the meaning of extension, of looking beyond the immediate vicinity and into the future. Positioned at the top of a castle, this is a man with a view: purple mountains for goals and intuition, a peaceful lake and sandy shore, and, rising into the hills, modest dwellings, forests, and fields. This feels like fertile land, where ideas and dreams are nurtured. Our hero has plans, and they are beginning to grow, just like the leaves budding from the two wands. He stands partly in profile, rather than facing us, gazing into his globe. The two wands on each side of our hero and the card's Roman number, II, create a portal, a doorway to another realm of experience, and soon the man will be ready to step into it. This links with his Tree of Life sphere, Chockmah, for wisdom. His red robe and hat signify vitality and the material world.
The man on the Two of Wands already knows he is partway toward his dream, and he has gained confidence through the work he has already done. This is shown by the wand on the right on the card, which stands on the ground, lower than the wand he holds. A small ribbon is tied at the base, perhaps as a seal, to signify that this wand, or part of his project, is complete. On the plinth at the left is the intriguing emblem of a black cross with red-and-white flowers: roses for passion, lilies for purity, and the cross for faith. (The saltire, or St. Andrew's cross, is also depicted on the Six of Cups.) Roses on a cross can signify the Rosicrucian order, a secret esoteric brotherhood that took the Rosy Cross as its symbol. A principal text of Rosicrucianism is the fifteenth-century allegory *The Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosenkreutz*, which features a rose cross and a magical castle. On our Two of Wands, both the castle wall and cross may be an intentional reference to Rosicrucianism, as this order also influenced Freemasonry; the Rider-Waite's creator, A. E. Waite, was a mason, and so familiar with this alchemical image. Note, too, the cross and roses design in stone on the Three of Pentacles (see page 152).
Astrologically, this card is linked with Mars in Aries, a fiery pairing that signifies willpower and energy. The challenge is to temper the fire when necessary and resist impatience.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Two of Wands shows you making plans and moving forward, so travel arrangements are one meaning of the card. In your work, you are gaining influence and proving your worth. In return, you receive good support and advice. The card can also show new creative partnerships and beginning a new project or enterprise.
As there are two wands on the card, there are also two aspects to your situation. Consider what helps you on your path and any issues that hold you back. Make a plan that maximizes your strengths so your talent continues to shine.
An additional meaning of the Two of Wands is a new romantic partnership, and it often comes up in a reading to reveal that the relationship begins at work or through a mutual friendship or leisure interests. Spiritually, too, you are feeling more connected within yourself and the world at large, so you may feel drawn to development courses or simply spending time connecting with nature. Overall, great opportunities are on the way, allowing you to move up a level. Make the most of these offers-your star is rising.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, your talent may be wasted because those who can help you progress are not listening. If this is the case, consider a change of scenery. You need to be with people who understand your views and appreciate your skills. The card can also show misplaced trust and an unreliable partner. Check if those close to you are pulling their weight—or you could be the one doing all the work. In relationships, a partner is unreliable.",Two of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,674,3803

Astrological Association: Sun in Aries
Number: 3
Tree of Life Position: Binah, the sphere of understanding
Key Meanings: Action and adventure
### UNDERSTANDING THE THREE OF WANDS
For one time only in the tarot sequence, we see a figure with no visible face. Whereas on the Two of Wands the man is in part profile, in the Three he has turned his back on us entirely. He has stepped down from the protection of his castle and now stands on higher ground right above a bay, where he has planted three wands firmly in the land, one of which he also holds. The two wands behind him offer protection; the third one he leans on, giving him support. He has passed through the portal of two wands and taken a step closer into the scene we saw at a distance in card Two. Now, our adventurer's cloak is a more vibrant red, for energy; he sports green, the color of nature and fertility, and wears a thin headband like card I, The Magician (page 34), symbolizing the mind-and his willpower to succeed. In this card, the man's headband looks as if it is waiting for a Roman victory wreath, the honor given to a homecoming hero. This theme continues with the checkered throw that sits over his left shoulder, Roman style; the pattern is reminiscent of flags used to signal the start and end of races, traditionally taken as a trophy by the champion. With headband and throw, the figure on the Three is already signaling that he is one of life's winners.
Astrologically, the Three of Wands is linked with the Sun in the sign of Aries. This indicates passion, strong communication, and clear goals. The potential issue with super-solar Aries is impatience, but that's because Ariens simply want results. This action-driven influence is softened by the meaning of the card's Tree of Life sphere, Binah, for understanding and the receptive feminine principle.
Dynamic number three, number of growth and change, is shown in three boats, three wands, and three buds on each wand, reinforcing the card's meaning of productivity-this is work in progress. The boats are pointing away from the shore, so we sense that this young man is an entrepreneur who has just launched his first fleet of three, carrying valuable cargo to a new destination. The vessels are symbols of the beginning of his journey toward distant shores and his future goals.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Three of Wands is one of the tarot's good-fortune cards. It reveals successful enterprise and seeing your projects and relationships thrive; it is also a great indicator for weddings and a new, important relationship. It predicts a busy, intense period of activity-so be prepared to be inundated with texts, emails, calls, and visitors. This card is often an indicator of an imminent trip away and seeing your plans realized-whether those are travel plans, business plans, a wedding, or other projects you have nurtured. This is also a time for great communication and self-expression through chosen interests such as art, music, crafts, and sport. The Three of Wands also favors individuality and nonconformism, so you may feel drawn to unconventional people and projects now. Also, pride yourself on your quirks and eccentricities, and let others see all you have to offer rather than the aspects of you with which you assume they are most comfortable. From this, you can gain even more confidence and even admiration. You are unique, after all. The Three's challenge is to keep the balance between staying focused on the prize while remaining patient, calm, and in the now. Appreciate, too, those people who are around you now; try to make time for friends who don't immediately fit into your future plans.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Three of Wands shows communication problems. Plans are delayed and it may be difficult to make progress in your projects. Relationships can suffer under this influence, as you find it hard to express yourself and understand what others are saying. Misunderstandings may make you feel needlessly isolated. If this applies to you, resist the frustration that this influence brings and go with a slower pace for a while. Overall, however, these are minor negatives; this is still a card of good fortune, even when reversed, so don't let glitches become a distraction. You can still succeed.",Three of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,631,3687

### UNDERSTANDING THE FOUR OF WANDS
One of the happiest cards of the tarot's minor arcana, the Four of Wands shows celebration. A couple stands triumphant, holding up bouquets of flowers. Four wands make an arbor hanging with garlands of ripe fruit-lemons, apples, plums, purple grapevines, and pink blooms. Three tiny figures are dancing, outside the walls of a city. This scene might depict harvest time, a public holiday, or even a wedding. The inspiration for the card may draw upon two pagan festivals-Beltane, or May Day, if we see the wands as maypoles, and Lammas, the Celtic celebration of the first day of the harvest. May Day, held on May 1, has its origins in the Celtic festival of Beltane, which celebrated the coming of spring and the end of seed-planting. Maypoles-tall wands-were raised in villages, where the people danced around them to honor fertility. A May Queen and King were crowned with flowers-much like the couple on the Four of Wands, who, dressed in Roman-style robes, echo the origins of the celebration as the Roman holiday of Florlia, or festival of flowers. The bright-yellow background of the card signifies solar energy, the power of the sun to make all life grow. It also symbolizes consciousness, in that the couple present themselves for all to see in public celebration. They wear blue and red robes, for truth and passion and the material world, respectively. The dominant red and yellow are similar to the colors of card I, The Magician, with his luminous yellow background, rose briars, and red robes, for the energy to manifest his desires. Strength, card VIII, has a similar palette, again for vitality and also, acting with conscious awareness. Number four is the number of stability and balance. In the passionate suit of wands, it denotes security, shown by the protective walls of the castle, and celebration. In the kabbalistic Tree of Life (see page 234), the card links with Chesed, the sphere of love-which is why this card is often referred to as ""the honeymoon."" Astrologically, the Four of Wands is linked to the planet Venus in the sign of Aries. This indicates passion, spontaneity, and joie de vivre. Aries, however, can be dominating at times, which can make love too intense or driven.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
This lovely card reveals success after completion-a time for reward. Socially, you will have the opportunity to celebrate and really enjoy yourself; the card predicts you will be brimming with confidence and full of vitality. You also establish yourself in your work and at home, completing a building or remodeling project or moving to a larger property. The vibe of the card is putting down roots, just like the wands. People around you note your willingness to be a pillar of the community and involve yourself in local issues and social events. In work, your talent is appreciated, and you are full of ideas and enthusiasm. Spiritually, the card shows that you share your light with others. This often comes up in readings to predict that a new partner or love interest will open their hearts and express love and affection. It is also known as the honeymoon card-literally, or as a time to celebrate, run free, and enjoy what life has to offer. It is auspicious for creativity, and artistic projects flourish under the uplifting influence of the Four of Wands.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, this is one of the few minor arcana cards that retains its positive meaning, albeit with minor irritations. You don't get all the time you need to focus on doing what you love—from traveling to creative projects and socializing—and you may experience some disruption to plans. In this position, you might just be feeling invisible and not heard. However, if you are feeling too much like the outsider, consider if your environment is right—it's likely that it's them, not you. Overall, however, this unsettled phase will soon pass as the sunny aspect of the upright card prevails.",Four of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,593,3521

Element: Fire
Astrological Association: Saturn in Leo
Number: 5
Tree of Life Position: Geburah, the sphere of power
Key Meanings: Competition and debates
### UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE OF WANDS
The Five of Wands shows five young men at odds with one another, holding a wand, a symbol of the ego and passion, which links with the card's element of Fire. They all have their own take on a situation, and because they are not acting in harmony as a group, they appear to be getting nowhere. Each is absorbed in his own game: one stands victorious, holding up his wand in triumph; a group of three crosses wands; and a fifth holds his wand over his shoulder, trying to keep it for himself.
These individuals can be seen as the pages of the four minor arcana suits, which approach this contest of strength in different ways. The victorious youth in brown and the youth in green, right in the center of the fight, are fiery Pages of Wands; the youth in blue, holding tight to his prize and showing he can lift its weight, the Page of Pentacles; the aggressor in red, the Page of Swords; and the passive youth in blue and white, defending himself, the Page of Cups. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Geburah, or power-here, the youths make a show of their power, but to no great effect. No one will get hurt; as the Rider-Waite's creator, A. E. Waite, says, ""This is mimic warfare"" and ""a sham fight.""
The twelve total buds growing from the wands symbolize budding ideas. The number twelve relates to Lamed, the twelfth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which originally meant to goad-its pictogram represents a staff, or wand.
Five is the number of mankind, as well as of the quintessence, or fifth element in alchemy. In the Five of Wands, this suggests that despite ongoing disorder, order can at some point be restored. Like the quintessence, the solution may be invisible now, but it is possible. The chaos will calm, as the next card in the suit sequence is the six, the number of harmony, and the meaning of that card is victory (see page 214).
The card's astrological association of Saturn in Leo presents a conflict-Leo's heady highs and need to show off do not sit easily with the disciplinarian planet Saturn. In the Five of Wands, this brings a sense of frustration, like a fire trying to stay alight despite lashings of rain.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The traditional meaning of this Five of Wands is competition, and the message is to hold your position, rather than compromise. Unlike the Five of Swords, this card does not predict outright battle, but there will be fiery opinions and a lack of agreement, at least for now. Misunderstandings abound, particularly in work matters. You may find yourself in meetings during which everyone is talking at once, defending their position rather than reaching a consensus; it's a fight just to be heard. Scheduling problems and delays to travel plans are an additional meaning, so double-check travel documents and emails, appointments, accounts, and agendas; pay close attention to any written documents. The Five of Wands often comes up in readings to show being surrounded by people with strong opinions, particularly in families; in education, it predicts that you will need to compete hard in tests or examinations-but you can succeed. On a lighter note, the card can also show competitions that are important to you, such as sporting events.","### REVERSED MEANING

The reversed meaning of the Five of Wands is deception and misinformation. You may be mislead, so carefully consider the source of messages before you make assumptions; what you hear may be exaggerated or untrue. In its most negative aspect, the card can show dishonesty. In general, the Five of Wands can show you feeling stressed and in a weak position, and if so, it is better to keep your own counsel just for now, or at least be highly selective about the people you choose to trust. An additional meaning of the card is litigation.",Five of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,597,3441

Key Meaning: Victory
### UNDERSTANDING THE SIX OF WANDS
A young man on a white charger parades in triumph, wearing a laurel wreath, the Roman symbol of victory and power, echoed by the wreath tied to his wand. The wand through the wreath is a symbol of fertility, of hopes coming to fruition, echoed in the horse's green caparison, the color of nature and new life. The steed is white, for purity of intention. The spectators carry five wands; they might be the five sparring youths from the Five of Wands, now holding their wands upright and orderly, focusing on celebrating the homecoming hero. One of the youths is facing away from us, as if standing guard over the procession, to show that the rider's victory is protected and cannot be challenged.
The horseman can also be seen as an important messenger, bringing great news. The youths may be footmen, making way for the rider on his course to deliver his message to royals or other dignitaries. He has his horse on a tight rein, to show that he has his element, Fire, under control. He may be exuberant, but there is a calmness in his victory that is gracious and stately. This attitude of dignity links with the card's number, six, which stands for harmony and passivity. Six also has the meaning of the past creating the present and future, so we might also assume that the rider's past efforts have been rewarded, which makes for a glowing future.
The Tree of Life sphere associated with this card is Tiphareth, which means beauty and rebirth, which can be interpreted as relating to beauty, or grace, in victory. The card's astrological association of Jupiter in Leo highlights leadership and innovation, and reveals resilience-the ability to overcome minor obstacles and develop a bigger and higher perspective, which is symbolized by the laurel wreath set high on the rider's tall wand.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
This card signifies deserved success. The Six of Wands is a very welcome card if you have been struggling recently and feeling unsure if your hard work will finally pay off. The card often relates to work, career, and projects and can show promotion and a new contract or bid; it can also reveal that an outstanding legal matter will go in your favor. Enjoy this happy time and don't be afraid to share your accomplishment; others will support and applaud you. It's time to bask in glory, be self-satisfied, and make space to celebrate, regardless of how busy you may be.
In personal relationships, the card shows that feelings are declared-and will be well received. The card can also indicate a proposal when it appears close to emotion cards such as the Ace of Cups, Two of Cups, Ten of Cups, and the major arcana card VI, The Lovers (see pages 120, 122, 138, and 24). This explains the additional meaning of the Six of Wands for celebrations, such weddings or attending parties and degree ceremonies. A traditional meaning of the card is good news, which can relate to any life aspect-love, property, education and work, and decision-making. Look to the other cards that appear close to the Six of Wands in a reading to determine the nature of the news on the way.","### REVERSED MEANING

Unfortunately, when the Six of Wands reverses, the reward you have hoped for doesn't materialize when you need it to. But all is not lost—this is a card of delay rather than cancellation, so hold fast to your goals. The wait for news may be frustrating, but this is due to circumstances beyond your control rather than a reflection on your abilities. The message is to be as patient as you can, and distract yourself with other tasks (rather than check your emails and text messages every five minutes). The card can also show you being let down by others, which dints your confidence. However, as with all the tarot's minor arcana cards, this is a passing phase, so try not to take such disappointments to heart. An additional interpretation is pride, which in the reversed position can reveal an arrogant, self-important individual.",Six of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,571,3286

### UNDERSTANDING THE SEVEN OF WANDS
The scale of this card is curious-a singular young man dwarfs the landscape at his feet. He is giant-sized, rather like Jonathan Swift's Gulliver in Lilliput, the island of tiny people who ask for Gulliver's help and then seek to punish him when he will not obey their immoral commands. Towering over the small land of hills and the river below, the youth of this Seven of Wands is certainly out of place.
With both hands on the wand, he uses everything in his power to defend his position. Due to his size, he sees the bigger picture, and he has great ideas, symbolized by the five buds on his wand compared with the groups of two and three buds on the six wands before him. His effort is all for a good purpose-he is dressed in green, the color of nature, to symbolize growth, and his hose is orange, the color of his suit element, Fire. He is very sure of his territory, standing astride a river; his position and intentions are clear. Six other wands rise up toward him, but he is ready for the challenge.
The card's astrological association, Mars in Leo, brings together the warlike planet, Mars, with exuberant Leo, creating an unstoppable force. Leo the lion is also depicted in major arcana card VIII, Strength, one of the ancestor cards of the Seven of Wands (see Strength's Reflections at VIII, Strength, on page 62). Netzach, the card's Tree of Life sphere, stands for endurance, which the youth needs to avoid letting his fiery ambition burn out. The twenty total buds on the seven wands can be linked with the Hebrew letter Resh, which means success. Victory is within his grasp.
The card's number is the mystical number seven. Seven comprises three, the number of heaven, and four, the number of earth, so the challenge is to bring heaven down to earth-to make your dreams reality (see VII, The Chariot, page 58). In the Seven of Wands, this reward comes from negotiation and courage-standing your ground.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The Seven of Wands reveals obstacles in your path, but you will keep going and overcome them. Success is in reach. The card is particularly relevant to work and career matters and highlights all negotiations; regardless of how difficult the conversation becomes, there's a need to keep talking and stay in conversation until you are satisfied with the outcome. You will need to stand tall, and by being very clear on your position, you can win.
There's a noble aspect, too, about this card, and it often comes up in a reading to show you may be defending others, not just your own interests. In this sense, the Seven of Wands is the card of the advocate, and you may find you need to stand up for those who are not able to speak for themselves. Morality is important to you now, so the Seven of Wands shows you may become the spokesperson for a group-such as a committee or jury. The task isn't an easy one, but you will persist.
In relationships, there are hurdles, and you may need to fight for love. This can be only temporary, however, so by all means stand up for your relationship in the short-term, provided you are sure your partner will return your loyalty.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Seven of Wands can indicate that you doubt your purpose. You may struggle to be heard and may have to overcome constant obstacles—but now it's unclear if it's all going to be worthwhile. As a result, the card can show anxiety and hesitation. An additional meaning is feeling overwhelmed with continual problems, particularly if this Seven appears with the ""burden"" card, the Ten of Wands. If so, the message here is to focus on the areas where you can still make a difference, while accepting the things you cannot change. This applies to relationships, too, so ask which imperfections you can live with and which aspects—such as your partner's attitude or circumstances—are nonnegotiable.",Seven of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,592,3348

Element: Fire
Astrological Association: Mercury in Sagittarius
Number: 8
Tree of Life Position: Hod, the sphere of majesty and the mind
Key Meanings: News and travel
### UNDERSTANDING THE EIGHT OF WANDS
The Eight of Wands shows eight wands, all with green buds, flying through a gray and blue sky. The scene below is very similar to that in the Ace of Wands-a small white dwelling on a hill with green hills and a river below. This is one of two minor arcana cards without people (the other is the Three of Swords), so there is no obvious action to interpret. This is intentional, in that the sole focus is the flight of the wands, giving the card its primary meaning of movement. Simply, we see a flight of wands, ripe with green leaves of potential, over a calm landscape. They may be carrying messages, like carrier pigeons, perhaps fixed to the lower part of the wands that are not visible in the image; perhaps they are spears or love's arrows about to land. However we view these magical wands, all events are about to speed up. The wand motifs take up most of the card's space, dominating everything below.
The card's astrological association is Mercury in Sagittarius. Sagittarius, the sign of exploration, combines with Mercury, the winged messenger, to give the meaning of dynamic movement and travel. An additional quality is perspective and insight-just what we need if we are to effectively deal with this Eight's fast and varied demands. The card's Tree of Life sphere is Hod, which relates to the power of the mind: Creative thinking, logic, and a sharp wit are called for.
The card's number is eight, which stands for both stability and renewal (see also card VIII, Strength, page 62). The eights in the minor arcana, as they are near the end of the numbered sequences, hold all our experiences up to that point. We have past knowledge to draw upon, which gives us wisdom and enables new choices-to make new contacts and find a fresh direction.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
Along with the Ace, the Eight of Wands is one of the most positive cards of the suit. It brings lots of communication, so you may be inundated with emails, calls, and exciting offers. If you have felt held back, or stuck waiting for decisions, you will soon have positive news. All your projects grow wings, moving swiftly forward. Just be prepared for the shift; fast, frantic events will energize you, but you will also need to prioritize any offers. Don't feel you have to say yes to everything. Choose wisely and enjoy this frenetic, exciting influence.
In relationships, the Eight of Wands can bring great news about love, particularly if you have been separated from a partner recently or are waiting to hear from a potential partner. You may be traveling soon to see one another. Additionally, the card has often come up in readings to show the professions of carpentry and scaffolding-work that involves using or building a framework","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the simple meaning of the card is delay. You may have lots of pending work to finish and may be waiting for a particular decision that will unblock other ambitions, but just for now, you'll need to be patient. It's also important to be discreet about any grievances you have just now.

In relationships, you may be finding it hard to communicate and as a result be drawn into petty arguments. If you have hopes for a new love, you may be feeling disappointed by the person's lack of contact. Look to the surrounding cards for indictors as to what this means; negative cards such as the Three or Ten of Swords or The Lovers reversed (see pages 180, 194, and 54) suggest that this potential relationship may not get off the ground. More positive cards, such as the upright Lovers or the Ace, Two, Six, Nine, or Ten of Cups (see pages 54, 120, 122, 136, and 138), say that there is still hope you'll connect again.

An additional meaning of the reversed card is jealousy.",Eight of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,511,2940
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_nine_of_wands,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## NINE OF WANDS
Element: Fire
Astrological Association: Moon in Sagittarius
Number: 9
Tree of Life Position: Yesod, the sphere of foundation and the unconscious mind
Key Meanings: Defense and strength
### UNDERSTANDING THE NINE OF WANDS
A wounded man is on the lookout. Among eight protective wands, symbols of his resources and responsibilities, he holds a ninth tightly with both hands, like a weapon. The other eight wands are orderly, as if standing at attention, ready for any eventuality. He has positioned himself on a man-made platform, which relates to his Tree of Life sphere, Yesod, or foundation. He has a solid base from which to operate. The platform also sets our would-be warrior away from the green hills behind him; he needs to be a little detached from society so he can better see the approach of potential opponents. And physically, this defender is not to be taken lightly. With his powerful build, he symbolizes strength and endurance; from experience, he has learned to expect challenges to his position, and his past battles are symbolized by the bandage worn around his head. This injury doesn't deter him, and he almost wears it like a bandana, with pride.
The card's astrological association, Moon in Sagittarius, shows great resilience and strength of character-it combines the sensitive mind, the Moon, with the Sagittarian qualities of directness, perception, and the willingness to take risks. This combination may also reveal a need to explore hidden factors, to dig deep to get to the truth.
The card's number is nine, comprising three sets of three. Three is a dynamic number, and when multiplied by itself, symbolizes intense productivity. It also holds the threes as a symbol of the integration of mind, body, and spirit. In the Nine of Wands, all the wands of the previous suit cards accumulate. This reflects the wisdom of experience, but also the responsibility of accrued demands and pressure that is expressed in card Ten, ""the burden."" By keeping his wands in order in the Nine, the inevitable buildup of untenable demands expressed in the Ten can be avoided.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright Nine of Wands shows that you are in a very strong position. You have fought long and hard to get where you are, and have endured heavy challenges, particularly in work. Being constantly vigilant and ingenious can be exhausting, however, so use your energy wisely; plan all activities meticulously and don't overexert yourself, and you will have all the resources you need to see you through. Thankfully, as with all minor arcana cards, this influence will not last forever. You won't always need to defend yourself to this degree, or make so many sacrifices. This card also highlights the fine balance between being adequately defended and being defensive. While it's appropriate to establish and protect your boundaries, defensiveness keeps you in a negative mind-set; the Nine often comes up in a reading to show a person who is fearful that his or her idea or other work will be stolen-but this is just a perception rather than reality. It can also show an unwillingness to hand in an assignment or to make your work public in some other way due to fear of rejection or criticism. If so, it's time to let go-you have worked hard, and your efforts will meet with appreciation and support.","### REVERSED MEANING

When the Nine of Wands is reversed, you endure strong opposition, which seems unfair. You put in hard work—but receive little thanks in return. You give your all, but it still doesn't seem to be enough, so you may be at the mercy of an unreasonable boss or demanding children, friends, or clients. This situation is demotivating, so you become fixed on getting through tasks without enjoying the aspects of your work that used to be satisfying. Equally, you could be the one who is obstinate and inflexible in your attitude.

The reversed card can also show issues with boundaries. Someone may be invading your territory. In relationships, you may be dealing with an individual who is acting defensively because you are veering into uncomfortable territory for them.",Nine of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,559,3326

!Image of a tarot card with a person carrying a bundle of wands
Element: Fire
Astrological Association: Saturn in Sagittarius
Number: 10
Tree of Life Position: Malkuth, the Kingdom, the sphere of experience
Key Meanings: Responsibilities and a burden
### UNDERSTANDING THE TEN OF WANDS
A blond man is striding toward a house he can't see. He knows it is there-perhaps he has visited before, which might explain his confident step. There's an element of desperation here, too: Why would he choose to be so uncomfortable and sightless on his journey? He even chooses to hold his wands so his right hand is in front of his eyes, further blocking the view. Perhaps he sees himself as less than human, a blind beast desperate to release its burden. The man's determination to arrive at his destination is symbolized by his orange tunic, representing his suit's element of Fire, for passion and energy. And the destination looks worthwhile: We see fertile lands, with rolling hills, trees, and a field ploughed and ready for planting-maybe his ten wands will grow there into strong trees. To the right is a manor house, symbolizing that hard work now will pay off in the future if our laborer can endure the load and keep going. This links with the card's astrological association of Saturn in Sagittarius; Sagittarius's need for freedom and travel is eclipsed by the dour taskmaster planet, Saturn. In this sense, the Ten of Wands suggests the struggle between grinding work and keeping our dreams alive.
In numerology, the number ten represents completeness and perfection. In the Ten of Wands, however, the impact of ten wands of Fire is exhausting, both emotionally and financially. The individual sphere associated with this card is Malkuth, for kingdom-so the Ten of Wands in this sense suggests taking on the whole kingdom, or world, which can be both a burden and a burning ambition.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
The upright Ten of Wands reveals that you are carrying too much on your shoulders just now. You may have become so used to being overloaded that you've lost sight of the reason you're doing the work. It's a common card for homemakers and entrepreneurs, those of you who must multitask and constantly respond to a wide range of demands. Consider saying no to any future requests and decide which projects or jobs you can stop or hand over to someone else. There's a real need here for delegation and support from others. No one expects you to carry this on your own, and this goes for emotional burdens, too-they need to be shared. The card can also suggest that you may be carrying issues from the past. On a more positive note, the card reveals that you can be successful, albeit with careful management of time and resources. This card can show up in a reading to reveal that you may need to look for less demanding work, but you feel too drained by your present job to spend time searching. This puts you in a catch-22: The situation can't change until you pull back from current responsibilities and invest what energy you possess into changing your circumstances. The Ten of Wands can also show that relationships are neglected because all your attention is on work. Also note that if the Ten of Wands comes up as the you/situation card in a reading, you or the person you are reading for may not be receptive to the reading simply because too much is going on. Lay the cards again or wait three days.","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the card's meaning is very similar to that of the upright card, except that some of the burdens may be more perceived than real. This may be a sign of ongoing stress, where every task gets framed as a potential problem. The message here is to try to lighten up a little and take some of the pressure off yourself—you don't need to be perfect. Obstinacy is one of the card's meanings, so do ask yourself if you have created too much self-pressure, fixating on impossible goals.

The reversed card can also show you being caught in an exhausting grind between work and domestic commitments because you are trying to keep everyone happy. Make a vow to make some space for your own needs—you need to please yourself, too. When you can do this, you'll see the way ahead more clearly.",Ten of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,598,3428
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_page_of_wands,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## PAGE OF WANDS
Element: Earth of the suit of Fire
Key Meanings: Good news and communication
### UNDERSTANDING THE PAGE OF WANDS
The Page of Wands is looking upward toward the top of his wand, out of which are growing tiny leaf buds. The red plume on his hat looks like a flame, linking with the element of his suit-he is burning with ambition. The Page's tall wand is higher than him, showing that his ideas are greater than his experience, but he is inspired to overcome any shortfall in his knowledge with enthusiasm. His passion will propel him forward as he sees the potential in everything.
The card's element is Earth of Fire, which is the most grounded aspect of the passionate Fire element of this suit. The Earth and Fire elements combine in the pyramids, to the right of the picture-they comprise a square base (the square is an Earth symbol) and triangular sides (the triangle is a symbol of Fire). The pyramids also signify grand design, establishment, and wisdom-to which our ingénue Page aspires. He wears orange hose, the color of his Fire element, and a tunic decorated with black salamanders, creatures with legendary fireproof skin. The yellow background of the tunic fabric and the trim of the Page's boots echo the yellow tunic of the Fool (see page 30), who too aims to set the world alight. The Page's wand, with its five buds, echoes nature and growth. He may be in an arid desert land, but he has the resources to succeed.
Pages and Knights in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Page in a reading by working with the card's imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As an influence:** The Page of Wands in a reading brings good news about projects and any situation that requires negotiation. Messages, urgent emails, and phone calls keep you busy and may be demanding, but cool the fire a little and take a measured view before you react and assess just how much work you need to do. The atmosphere overall, however, is one of trust, and you can rely upon information you receive. Pages, with their youth, suggest young, or new, situations, from relationships to work.
The Page of Wands can bring a creative enterprise or job offer-and, while the status of the job may not be as high as you might expect, the overall package may appeal, at least in theory. Do, however, check the details and practicalities before you agree to anything.
As a person: A talkative, entertaining individual, the Page of Wands often turns up in reading to denote a writer. His wand is his pen, his way to express himself in the world at large. Equally, he may be a marketing executive, salesperson, actor, or team manager-any role that relies on personality and great communication skills. This Page is a hard worker, dedicated and enthusiastic, and charming company. He can influence others-just be aware that he can get bored easily and move on to whatever attracts him next (so if you see him as a potential lover, note his actions as well as his words). An additional interpretation of the Page is a reunion with a friend or old colleague with whom you will enjoy chatting and reminiscing.
As the ""you"" card in a reading:
Express yourself.
As an influence:
If two or more Pages fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Pages: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed
* Three Pages: Lots of social activities
* Four Pages: A social group of young people","### REVERSED MEANING

When reversed, the Page of Wands brings delays. Emails and other messages go astray and communication gets complicated. As a person, the Page reversed talks much like his upright counterpart, but the theme of the conversation is negative and rather relentless. As the upright Page holds fast to his goals, so the reversed Page won't let a morose subject drop. The card can also show stubbornness and an inability to listen to others' opinions.  This Page is fickle and does not follow through what he initiates. Eventually, his enthusiasm or obsessions burn out, he becomes easily bored or distracted, and he leaves you to deal with any fallout. An additional meaning is problems with literacy and can apply to a child or young person struggling with written communication or speech.",Page of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,642,3655
ultimate_tarot_chapter_5_knight_of_wands,ultimate_tarot,chapter_5,"## KNIGHT OF WANDS
Element: Fire of Fire
Astrological Associations: Scorpio and Sagittarius
Key Meaning: A proposal
### UNDERSTANDING THE KNIGHT OF WANDS
A horse appears to be dancing in the desert, near some pyramids. There's a flamboyant rider, full of verve and vigor; holding a wand, this Knight is on a mission to deliver a message.
The card's element is Fire of the suit of Fire. Fire doubled is a hot mix of passion, ambition, and desire, expressed in many of the card's motifs. The horse's mane and the Knight's red plume, sleeve, and saddle resemble flames; the three pyramids on the left of the card, with their triangular sides, link with the Fire element; and the Knight's tunic has a pattern of black salamanders, the creatures with legendary fireproof skin (see the Page of Wands, page 224). The wand itself can be seen as a torch, the carrier of a flame. The yellow tunic stands for the light of the sun, or the mind and conscious illumination.
Although the card's imagery speaks of fiery ambition and desire, there's no sense of chaos, danger, or imminent battle. The horse's reins are short and tight, which at first glance gives the impression that the horse is dancing or performing dressage. The Knight has control over the primal urges of the animal and knows when to give free rein and when to hold back.
The wand has no flame, but it is living wood, sprouting five buds, symbols of news and ideas. The number five in the tarot's minor arcana suits also indicates tests-with the Knight of Wands, the test is to control fiery impulses and manage our energy and talent to achieve success, much like the charioteer of card VII, The Chariot (see page 58). The three, the number of pyramids on the card, is a dynamic number, for creativity and production (see also card III, The Empress, page 42).
Knights and Pages in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Knight in a reading by working with the card's imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As an influence:** Events speed up. Any blocks to progress will be lifted, so this is a welcome card if you have been waiting for decisions or have generally been feeling stuck. You can now have the conversations and action you need to move your projects on; follow your intuition and push forward. This card is particularly auspicious for moving house, finding new work, and making progress on personal and professional projects. In readings, this Knight often appears to predict a successful writing project. In other creative pursuits, you attract acknowledgment and support, both emotionally and financially. An additional meaning of the card is travel and emigration.
As a person:
Creative and dynamic, the Knight of Wands is an innovator and likes to do things his way. He inspires those around him and is excellent at networking to promote his ideas. He may be a traveler or visitor, and he will have had many experiences and stories to tell. He is, however, impatient to get things done and can make snap judgments about people based on first impressions. As a potential partner, he can show a charismatic, talkative individual who may take things a little too fast at first.
As the ""you"" card in a reading:
Fire up your ambition.
As an influence:
If two or more Knights fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Knights: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed
* Three Knights: Men meeting up
* Four Knights: Lots of action; events speed up","### REVERSED MEANING

In general, the reversed Knight of Wands reveals a creative block or miscommunication—so emails go astray and other messages are not delivered. The reversed Knight also indicates delays and deferred decisions; you may feel frustrated at the lack of progress. Know that this influence is temporary and will pass. In the meantime, hold fast to your plans and your self-belief.  As a person, the reversed Knight is egotistical. He thrives on status but is generally unwilling to do any hard work to deserve it; regardless, he will step up to take the credit. Insincere and attention-seeking, he acts out of self-interest.",Knight of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,641,3702

**Element:** Water of the suit of Fire
**Astrological Associations:** Pisces and Aries
**Chakras:** Sacral, throat, and third eye, for creativity, communication and insight
**Key Meanings:** Creativity and focus
### UNDERSTANDING THE QUEEN OF WANDS
The Queen of Wands is an aspect of card III, The Empress, or mother archetype. She is the soul aspect of the mother, just as The Queen of Cups is the heart aspect and the Queen of Swords, the mind (see pages 144, 200, and The Empress, page 42).
The most vital of the four Queens, the Queen of Wands sits directly facing us, holding a tall wand, her suit symbol of creativity and purpose. Like the Magician (see page 34), she manifests her ideas to follow her soul's path. The wood of the wand is alive with green shoots; it is the Queen's job to see them thrive. In her left hand is a sunflower, a solar symbol for energy, growth, and illumination. Three tiny buds shoot from the upper part of the wand. Three is a dynamic number of creation, and also the number of her ancestor card, the Empress.
The red-haired Queen's suit element is Fire, shown in many motifs on her card. Robed in gold, her throne is decorated with sunflowers and heraldic lions in orange, the color of flames. Low pyramids appear to her left. The triangle shape of the pyramids is a symbol for Fire in alchemy, and these ancient structures also offer a metaphor for this Queen's strong foundation in the world.
Along with Fire, her suit element, the Queen also takes Water, the element of all the Queens. The combination of Fire and Water reveals the careful balancing of emotion and ideas to create conditions for success. Both practical and cerebral, she is highly resourceful, knowing when to draw upon her Fire energy to take action or attune to her Water emotions to show sensitivity to her environment and others' needs.
In esoteric tarot, the Queen of Wands is associated with the leopard, but in the Rider-Waite deck, she is shown with a black cat, a sign of magic-the witch's familiar. The statuary lions on each side of her throne symbolize Sekhmet, an ancient Egyptian lioness deity associated with Bastet, depicted originally as a lioness and later as a cat. The Queen of Wands wears a red cat brooch at her heart, a Bastet amulet, which symbolizes power, protection, and pleasure.
Queens and Kings in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the Queen as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As a person:** This Queen is often the card of the artisan, entrepreneur, counselor, organizer, or leader-the writer, producer, marketer, or business administrator: whatever relies upon spark and communication for success. Sociable and supportive, she is intensely loyal, just like her associated sign of Aries. This self-aware Queen is also in touch with her intuition, so she makes good choices in relationships. The Queen of Wands often loves nature and animals, too.
As an influence:
Ideas flourish, and you can now show others what you can do. This is no time for reticence; fire up your enthusiasm and express yourself. Reflect, also, on how you are managing your life just now, to make sure you have the time to make space for the opportunities coming your way. Overall, though, the Queen of Wands shows you will have the strength you need, and your relationships, too, are energized-romance, friendships, family ties, and professional contacts.
As the ""you"" card in a reading:
Step in to your power.
As an influence:
If two or more Queens fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:
* Two Queens: Rivalry
* Three Queens: Helpful friends
* Four Queens: Women meeting up","### REVERSED MEANING

You may feel controlled when the Queen of Wands reverses due to others' pointless interference. There is a great need for organization—but disorder rules. This may be because you, or someone close, has taken on too much and cannot admit it. Consider if this is a pattern—a way of avoiding being who you are, due to fear of rejection.

As a person, the reversed Queen of Wands breaks promises. She can be envious and does not want anyone around her to shine more brightly.",Queen of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,647,3770

### UNDERSTANDING THE KING OF WANDS
The King of Wands is an aspect of card IV, The Emperor, or father archetype, who brings structure, order, and authority. The King of Wands is the father-aspect of the Emperor who offers inspiration and communication.
The King's robe and the back of his throne are decorated with black salamanders, the creatures who have legendary fireproof skin (see also the Knight and Page of Wands, pages 226 and 224). A live salamander appears to the right of the card to reinforce its importance as a symbol of the King's suit element of Fire. Lions also decorate the throne, and the King wears a lion-head amulet around his neck, a symbol of strength and protection linking with one of his zodiac signs, Leo the Lion.
His wand has four buds, which relate to the number of his ancestor card IV, The Emperor, and also symbolizes the four elements. His crown, cuffs, and cape have flame motifs, and he wears a fiery orange robe and cloak. His cap is red-at first glance, it would appear he has red hair, but this is actually called a ""cap of maintenance,"" worn by nobility and the other three minor arcana Kings (see pages 146, 176, and 198), that fits under a crown. Red and orange denote passion in the real world-or fiery ambition.
The card's element is Air of Fire, which can be interpreted as fire that breathes. The more air a fire has to burn, the brighter the fire and higher the flames. This also reveals the King's challenge: to keep feeding his desires without burning himself out. The green of his cowl and shoes symbolizes nature and wood, which feeds a fire, so he is mindful that to thrive, he needs to be in a productive, supportive environment.
Kings and Queens in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the King as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.
### UPRIGHT MEANING
**As a person:** This King of Wands is a man of the world, and it's likely that he has traveled widely, experiencing many cultures and countries. Talkative and energetic, his ideal vocations include business and management, communications and marketing, the travel industry, acting, and other roles that depend on self-motivation and individuality. He may be self-employed, running a business or acting as a freelance consultant. His has wisdom, very high standards that he applies to himself and those around him, and strong integrity. Courteous and considerate, he stays true to his values and acts according to his moral code. He is open and self-aware and does not judge other people on their backgrounds or beliefs; he often learns by listening to people talk about their experiences. As a free spirit, he respects others who don't conform. As a potential partner, he is passionate and communicative.
As an influence:
This is the right time to express your ideas and be the individual you are. Summon your entrepreneurial spirit, make a plan, and what you propose will be well received. The practical support you need will be there, but you need to be the initiator. What you do now reflects your truth. Don't let perfectionism get in the way of your creativity-what you do is more than good enough.

The Key is profoundly metaphysical in its symbolism. As the man looks at the woman and she looks up at the angel, the truth conveyed is that the conscious mind cannot approach the superconscious unless it passes through the subconscious-a thought to consider in meditation. The lovers stand here in friendly harmony, with nothing to hide from each other, as the nudity of the figures indicates. A harmonious and successful life depends on the cooperation between the conscious and the subconscious. The mountain in this Key indicates the fruitfulness of correct thought. Key 6 is often symbolized by a man standing between two women. There is a cupid with a bow and arrow above them. The meanings for divinatory purposes are derived from this older symbolism.
Divinatory Meaning: Choice, temptation, attraction. The struggle between sacred and profane love. Harmony of the inner and outer aspects of life.
## KEY 7
## THE CHARIOT
This key signifies victory for the triumphant king who has conquered on all planes, particularly those of the mind, science, and growth. He wears a diadem with an eight-pointed star, here representing dominion. The chariot stands for the human personality, which can be a vehicle for the expression of the Self. The symbol on the front of the chariot shows the wings of inspiration, above the Hindu sign of the union of positive and negative forces. The two sphinxes are again the outer pillars of the Tree of Life, related in this instance to Nature and not Spirit. They may pull in different directions if the will of the charioteer does not control them. In the hands of the king is the wand of will, with which he must control the sphinxes. The canopy of stars over his head indicates that celestial influences hang over him and affect his victory. On his shoulders are lunar crescents.
If his powers of observation are faulty, superficial, or fearful, the resulting sequence of subconscious reactions is bound to be destructive.
Key 7 means rest and victory, self-discipline and stability. The conqueror may not yet have conquered himself. Here we find both will and knowledge, but there is more desire to attain than proven power for real attainment.
Some occultists divide the Tarot Keys into three groups of seven cards each. In this case the number 7 indicates that the Fool has reached an outer triumph and is ready to learn further lessons in the next seven cards.
**Divinatory Meaning:** Triumph, success, control over the forces of nature-thus triumph over ill health as well as money difficulties or enemies of any sort, including one's own lower animal passions. This is a card of those who achieve greatness. It may also indicate travel in comfort. Mental and physical powers should lead to fulfillment.
## KEY 8
## STRENGTH
A woman garlanded with flowers is either closing or opening a lion's mouth. Above her head is the cosmic lemniscate of Eternal Life, indicating that she is in control, thanks to the spiritual power above her. She is exhibiting spiritual courage and the power that emanates from it, for the lion represents the passions and lower nature of Man. For a consciousness aware of the sign of Eternity above it, there are no obstacles, nor can there be any fear of resistance. Her simple white robe indicates purity. Around her waist there is a chain of roses-symbol of the union of desires, which creates such strength that wild, unconscious forces bow before it. The message transmitted by this Key is that we must learn to create a balance between our spiritual and carnal natures and thus influence the lower of the two. This lesson of the need for harmony between opposing forces is often noted in the Tarot.
**Divinatory Meaning:** Force of character, spiritual power overcoming material power, love triumphing over hate, the higher nature over carnal desires.","### Reversed

The fool is probably the most important card in the entire Tarot deck. Though he may be depicted as a court jester in some packs, in the deck we use in this book A. E. Waite had the card redrawn to match its inner meaning. Waite said of the Fool, in part:
He is a prince of the other world on his travels through this one-all amidst the morning glory, in the keen air. The sun, which shines behind him, knows whence he came, whither he is going, and how he will return by another path after many days. He is the spirit in each of experience.
Court de Gébelin places it at the head of the whole series as the zero or negative which is presupposed by numeration, and as this is a simpler so also is it a better arrangement. It has been abandoned because in later times the cards have been attributed to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and there has been apparently some difficulty about allocating the zero symbol satisfactorily in a sequence of letters all of which signify numbers.... The truth is that the real arrangement of the cards has never transpired.
Waite, in his book *The Pictorial Key to the Tarot*, places the Fool between Key 20 and Key 21. We have placed the Fool as No. 0, before Key 1, for it seems to us that the Fool represents the soul of everyman, which, after it is clothed in a body, appears on earth and goes through the life experiences depicted in the 21 cards of the Major Arcana, sometimes thought of as archetypes of the subconscious.
Let each reader use his imagination and find here his own map of the soul's quest, for these are symbols that are deep within each one of us.
In the Magician and the High Priestess, the Fool learns the uses of the conscious and subconscious aspects of the mind in order to create the bounty of Nature, as pictured in the Empress. The Emperor indicates the role of the ruler, and the Hierophant shows the place of the head of a religious body. In the Lovers, he learns that in order to have a harmonious life, the superconscious must be consulted through the subconscious.
Using his mentality and will, the Fool can ride the Chariot of success as long as he can be master of his passions. The woman in Key 8, Strength, shows him how, through the use of spiritual strength, he can control not only the animal world around him but also the lower forces in himself. The Hermit, with his lantern of Truth, offers to guide him on the spiritual path. When the Fool reaches the Wheel of Fortune, his apprenticeship is over. From now on he is on his own, to rise or fall, while the sphinx of his soul looks on. In Justice, he learns to have a balanced personality and to eliminate the outworn and useless.
He is the Hanged Man who has surrendered himself to Spirit and sacrificed his small desires for the greater one. Key 13 shows him that Death can also be a form of renewal and is not to be feared. The Archangel Michael shows him how to create by pouring the Waters of Life from the unseen into the seen. He has been shown all the secrets of life and how to use them, yet is tempted by the Devil in Key 15 to use his newfound power to create a life of selfish gain and material pleasure. The Fool is knocked from his material tower and awakened by a flash of spiritual insight to the knowledge that he is on earth to learn and put to use the eternal knowledge he has been given. Chastened, he now learns to meditate, and discovers that no destruction is final. But again, in the Moon card, the Fool is tempted, this time to use his psychic powers for personal glory, and he finds the upward path not only crooked but full of pitfalls. Finally, in the Sun, Key 19, he has learned his lessons well and they have become automatic. He rides forth in control of the horse of the physical-naked, for he no longer has anything to hide. The red feather in his hair shows he now has authority over the animal kingdom, and the sunflowers turning toward him are an indication that all nature turns to the developed soul for future growth.
Next he joins the angel Gabriel in calling all men to awaken to the glories of the spiritual life-and then his journey is over. The Fool is Spirit again, as in the beginning, but now he has passed through his initiations on the material plane, where he has played many parts and learned to control both involution and evolution as he dances the Dance of Life in the very center of the Universe.",,The Fool,major_arcana,upright,card_meaning,825,4415

Here we have a youth about to step off the edge of a precipice. He symbolizes the Lifepower before it enters into manifestation. Therefore he represents inexperience-which certainly can be foolish. He faces northwest, the direction of the unknown. The sun behind him is still rising, for the spiritual sun never reaches its zenith; if it did, it would descend and decrease in power. The wand over the youth's shoulder is a symbol of the will, and tied to it is a wallet that is thought to carry universal memory and instinct. (Another possible interpretation is that the wallet carries the four magic symbols that he will have to learn to use.)
The sign of the eagle on the wallet betokens virile strength and is also associated with the zodiacal sign Scorpio. The youth also carries a white rose, indicating that he is still free from animal forms of desire. The little white dog at the young man's heels has many possible meanings: he has been evolved from the wolf, showing that lower forms of life can be elevated and improved by human companionship; he also shows us that Nature is glad to follow along in Man's wake. The snowy mountains in several cards indicate the cold, abstract principles of mathematics, which govern all earthly phenomena.
The Fool is about to pass into the cycle of life through which each soul must journey-stages so graphically described in Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress*. Think of the youth as Spirit facing unknown possibilities of self-expression as he enters the world, an ignorant babe. He stands on spiritual heights, about to step down into manifestation. Every man must journey forward and choose between good and evil. If he has no philosophy, he is the Fool.

The Magician stands before a table on which are laid a Wand, a Cup, a Sword, and a Pentacle, representing the Minor Arcana and meaning Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. He is about to draw power from above to materialize his desires. Over his head is the cosmic lemniscate, shaped like a figure 8 on its side-a symbol of eternal life and dominion, indicating the harmonious interaction of the conscious and subconscious, idea and feeling, desire and emotion. About the Magician's waist we see the well-known symbol of eternity-a serpent devouring its tail. About his head is a rose vine with red roses, representing desire. In front of him are more red roses intertwined with the white lilies of abstract thought. His inner garment is the white of purity; his outer robe, the red of desire, activity, and passion. The hand holding the magic wand is the ego-consciousness reaching up for power while the other hand points to earth, as if the Magician wills earth's forces to be subservient to him. Or, it might be said that with one hand he reaches up to take the hand of the Infinite for accomplishment in the higher realms, while he reaches down with the other to encourage the evolution of the lower kingdoms-thus uniting Spirit and matter in eternity. The Magician represents Man's will in union with the Divine achieving the knowledge and power to bring desired things into manifestation through conscious self-awareness.

The High Priestess is seated between two pillars from the Temple of Solomon-the black pillar of Boaz representing the negative life force, and the white one, Jachin, the positive life force. Thomas Troward, in his book *The Hidden Power*, has this to say about the two pillars before the temple: ""They contain the key to the entire Bible and to the whole order of Nature, and as emblems of the two great principles that are the pillars of the universe, they fitly stood at the threshold of that temple which was designed to symbolise all the mysteries of Being...."" The High Priestess is protecting on her lap a scroll of esoteric wisdom inscribed with the word ""Tora"" (Divine Law), for it is not for all eyes to see. The solar cross on her breast, with arms of equal length, represents the balance of the positive and negative forces. (The upright is the positive, male element; the horizontal, the negative, female element.) The veil between the pillars is decorated with pomegranates (female) and palms (male)-symbols indicating that the subconscious is potentially reproductive. The edge of her gown, which balances the crescent moon at her feet, trails out of the picture, indicating the stream of consciousness, which flows into the background of Key 3,
### The High Priestess
The High Priestess is the virgin daughter of the moon, and wears on her head the symbol of a full moon, with a waxing and waning image of the moon on each side. She is the eternal feminine, sometimes called Isis or Artemis. She corresponds to all the virgin goddesses of the ancient world, even to Eve before her union with Adam. She is spiritual enlightenment, inner illumination. Whereas the Fool and the Magician represent only the potentiality, the will, to create, the High Priestess has the latent power to manifest. She is the link between the seen and the unseen.
**Divinatory Meaning:** Unrevealed future, hidden influences at work. Of special value for artists, poets, composers, mystics.

### Venus
The Empress' hair is bound with a wreath of myrtle-again reminiscent of Venus, as are the seven pearls around her neck. She wears a crown of twelve stars, each with six points, denoting dominion over the macrocosm, as does her scepter surmounted by a globe.
The High Priestess symbolizes the virgin state of the cosmic subconscious, but the Empress typifies the productive, generative activities in the subconscious after it has been impregnated by seed ideas from the self-conscious. The subconscious has control over all the steps of development in the material world; therefore the Empress represents the multiplicator of images.
She is the Goddess of Love, Venus, the symbol of universal fecundity. As the High Priestess is Isis veiled, the Empress is Isis unveiled.

The Emperor sits on his throne, commanding and stately. He is a solar figure, Martian in character-as testified by the rams' heads (emblems of Mars) that decorate his throne and appear on his left shoulder. In his right hand (the active, male side) he holds an Egyptian ankh (also called the Crux Ansata, Cross of Life). The ankh too is one of the symbols of Venus. In the Emperor's left hand (the passive, female side) is the globe of dominion, showing that only through the feminine power of love can he balance Spirit and matter and thus have the true power to rule. He is seated against a background of bare mountains.
His Key is No. 4, and this indicates all that is stable-four-square, broad-based, a foundation for the building of law and order. The number 4 also has this significance in Numerology. Four is the number of the elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water; there are four seasons in the year, four points to the compass, and four rivers in the garden of Eden. And there are four letters in the sacred name of God, IHVH, standing for Jehovah.
To recapitulate: Key 1, the Magician, is the active principle of life; Key 2, the High Priestess, the passive principle; Key 3, the Empress, is the ""word made flesh and dwelling amongst us."" The Emperor is the active Father force contrasted with the active Mother force through whom his characteristics are brought forth. He is the Magician after his union with the High Priestess has changed her into the Empress and made him the father of her offspring.
The Emperor stands for domination of the material world, for authority, paternity, and the regulation of life by law.
Note that flesh is not the enemy of the Spirit but its vehicle; Spirit is not the enemy of the flesh but its driving force.

Here again we have a figure seated between two pillars, repeating the theme of duality seen in the pillars behind the High Priestess. These are the pillars of the Tree of Life from the Kabalah, one representing Mercy and the other Severity. Or it might be said that the one on the right hand is law, and the left one liberty to obey or disobey. Both are necessary, for obedience through compulsion can never bring freedom-man must choose. The capitals of the pillars are decorated with mystic symbols of sexual union. The crossed keys at the feet of the Hierophant, one gold and one silver, are the solar and lunar currents of energy. The two tonsured priests kneeling before him wear Palliums to symbolize the yoke of union. The garment of one is decorated by the white lilies of thought; that of the other shows the roses of desire.
This master of the sacred mysteries wears the triple crown of a Pope, the lower design of trefoils representing the lower material world, the middle one representing the formative world, and the top tier representing the creative world. The symbol of three is repeated in his staff, revealing the realms of spirit, soul, and body. The letter W at the very top is the Hebrew letter Vav, meaning nail, means of union, link. Here it is used to suggest the linking of man to God through the inner voice.
It is of some significance that the number 5 is that of the planet Mercury, ruler of intelligence; 5 is also the number of Man or humanity.
The Hierophant represents traditional, orthodox teaching considered suitable to the masses. He is the ruling power of external religion, whereas the High Priestess teaches only in secret and to initiates.

The man in the picture represents the conscious mind in the earlier keys, the Magician and the Emperor, as well as the King standing in the chariot in Key 7. The woman is the subconscious mind, the High Priestess and the Empress; behind her is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, bearing the fruits of the five senses. The serpent of sensation climbs up the tree, for temptation comes from the subconscious. Behind the man is a leafless tree bearing the trefoil flames of the 12 signs of the Zodiac, each divided into three decans.
# Key 6: THE LOVERS
The Key is profoundly metaphysical in its symbolism. As the man looks at the woman and she looks up at the angel, the truth conveyed is that the conscious mind cannot approach the superconscious unless it passes through the subconscious-a thought to consider in meditation. The lovers stand here in friendly harmony, with nothing to hide from each other, as the nudity of the figures indicates. A harmonious and successful life depends on the cooperation between the conscious and the subconscious. The mountain in this Key indicates the fruitfulness of correct thought. Key 6 is often symbolized by a man standing between two women. There is a cupid with a bow and arrow above them. The meanings for divinatory purposes are derived from this older symbolism.

This key signifies victory for the triumphant king who has conquered on all planes, particularly those of the mind, science, and growth. He wears a diadem with an eight-pointed star, here representing dominion. The chariot stands for the human personality, which can be a vehicle for the expression of the Self. The symbol on the front of the chariot shows the wings of inspiration, above the Hindu sign of the union of positive and negative forces. The two sphinxes are again the outer pillars of the Tree of Life, related in this instance to Nature and not Spirit. They may pull in different directions if the will of the charioteer does not control them. In the hands of the king is the wand of will, with which he must control the sphinxes. The canopy of stars over his head indicates that celestial influences hang over him and affect his victory. On his shoulders are lunar crescents.
If his powers of observation are faulty, superficial, or fearful, the resulting sequence of subconscious reactions is bound to be destructive.
Key 7 means rest and victory, self-discipline and stability. The conqueror may not yet have conquered himself. Here we find both will and knowledge, but there is more desire to attain than proven power for real attainment.
Some occultists divide the Tarot Keys into three groups of seven cards each. In this case the number 7 indicates that the Fool has reached an outer triumph and is ready to learn further lessons in the next seven cards.

For a consciousness aware of the sign of Eternity above it, there are no obstacles, nor can there be any fear of resistance. Her simple white robe indicates purity. Around her waist there is a chain of roses-symbol of the union of desires, which creates such strength that wild, unconscious forces bow before it. The message transmitted by this Key is that we must learn to create a balance between our spiritual and carnal natures and thus influence the lower of the two.

The Hermit carries a patriarch's staff to use on the narrow path of initiation. His cloak is the mantle of discretion, and in some decks he partly covers the lantern with it as if to protect Truth from profane eyes.
He is ready to go to the help of every man who cries for Light. He remains on the heights throughout the long nights of spiritual darkness. Only those who dare, do, and keep silent can see the light of the Hermit's lamp. ""Be humble, if thou wouldst attain Wisdom; be humbler still when Wisdom thou hast mastered!"" (From *The Voice of Silence*.)
The number 9 is the number of pure intellect; also the number of initiation, because it is the trinity of trinities. In it all numbers are gathered up, to emerge once more in a new cycle of ten. The six-pointed star, the Seal of Solomon, is also figured as a 9 by counting the outer and inner points in a special way.

Here is the ever-turning Wheel of Fortune, which carries men and their destinies up and down. This is the exoteric meaning of the Key, but the many symbols it depicts give it a much more profound and subtle significance. The Serpent descending the Wheel is Typhon, the Egyptian god of evil, in one of his many forms. Typhon is also used to represent the Life-force on its descent into manifestation. This is the same force that descends at the command of the Magician (Key 1), in the garden. On the right-hand side of the Wheel, the jackal-headed Egyptian god, Hermes-Anubis, is the symbol of intelligence ever aspiring to ascend, while evil is ever descending into darkness and disintegration. The Wheel has three circles, of which the inner one is the creative force, the middle is the formative power, and the outer is the material world-the same symbolism as in the three tiers of the Hierophants crown. The eight spokes are like the eight-pointed star in Key 17; they represent universal radiant energy. This design is also repeated ten times on the costume of Key 0, the Fool. The numbers of the four mystical animals in the four corners add up to 26, which is the number of Jehovah, IHVH. These are mentioned in the Bible (Ezekiel 1:10; Revelation 4:7). There is also a correspondence to the fixed signs of the Zodiac-the bull to Taurus, the lion to Leo, the eagle to Scorpio, the man or angel to Aquarius. The Sphinx at rest at the top of the Wheel is Wisdom and the principle of equilibration-stability amidst movement, suggesting that we are not always governed by chance and fatality but that we have the power to change our lives.

Her sword is lifted in defense of justice, and none can escape it; it points upward, indicating victory, and is two-edged to convey that action destroys as well as builds, that the false must be cut away from the true. The three turrets of her crown and the four sides of the jewel in the center add up to the number 7 (Venus). In her left hand are the scales of gold, always related to balanced judgment. Balance is indicated here, as it is in Key 8, Strength. Keys 8 and 11 represent two aspects of the operation of a single power, creative imagination. All imagination is based on memory.

A youth is suspended by one foot from a T-cross of living wood. His arms, folded behind his back, together with his head, form a triangle with the point downward; his legs form a cross. To an extent, the Hanged Man is still earth-bound, for his foot is attached to the T-cross. He has attained at least a measure of perfection but not yet the complete freedom symbolized in Key 21, the World. The initiated man now stands as a responsible co-worker with the Divine. It is as though during the cycle from 1 to 10 God had held the hand of His child and guided him in carving the model of the man to be. Now the chisel is left in the hands of the matured youth, and he must create from the materials given him. He must, like the Hermit, take his part in the world's redemption.
The sign is the sign of the accomplishment of the Great Work-the overcoming of personality and the transmutation of the lower passions into pure gold. At the twelfth step we still find the initiate reversed, although ultimately he must stand on his own feet and surmount the cross thus:
We see in the Hanged Man the idea of the utter dependency of the human personality on the tree of Cosmic Life. Here we also have associations with Hercules as a symbol of the sun in its passage through the 12 signs of the Zodiac or the 12 labors of Hercules. He is a compound of god and hero; he represents the 12 steps of initiation through which every man must pass.

A skeleton in armor rides a white horse that tramples over a fallen king and draws near to a child and a woman, who turn from him in dread. The standing figure is a bishop in a miter shaped like a fish-denoting the Piscean Age (which is about to end). Death carries a banner on which there is a five-petaled rose, symbol of Mars and the Life-force. The river in the background indicates the constant circulation of the Life-force into materialization and out again. The water, as it flows to the sea, is sucked up by the sun to form clouds, from which rain falls into the streams and then to the river again. The sun on the eastern horizon indicates immortality-once the two towers (which we meet again in Key 18) have been passed.
The fundamental meaning of Death in Key 13 is that of the Manifestor of the Universe. The sun is the center and the 12 signs of the Zodiac surround it, making 13 signs in all. The king has fallen, reminding us that kings must inevitably fall. There is perpetual transformation, one aspect of which is death-birth. Death is a protest against stagnation-it is by death that social changes for the better come to pass and old ideas give way. With the new generation, new ideas gain currency as youth moves into maturity. This card is a suggestion to change old concepts for new, to change rigid intellectual patterns. Petty prejudices, ambitions, and opinions gradually die. The change from the personal to the universal view is so radical that mystics often compare it to death. But Death is the twin brother of Life. Creation necessitates its opposite-destruction. As Spirit descends into matter, so it must return to its source. Death is half of the Universal Transforming Principle. But Spirit is immortal; thus humanity can never die, for the Destroyer has become the Creator.

This Key represents the archangel Michael, who is related to fire and the sun. He pours the essence of life from the silver cup of the subconscious into the golden cup of the conscious, from the unseen into the seen and then back again. This depicts the entry of Spirit into matter and the influence of matter upon Spirit, as well as the flowing of the past through the present and into the future. The square on the breast of the angel indicates the four-square reality of physical manifestation, and within it the triangle of Spirit points upward. (This symbol is also the sign of the sacred book of the Tarot.) Four plus 3 equals 7, indicating the aspects of Divine Life and the seven chakras or centers of the body used in yoga meditation. Note that one foot rests on earth and the other in the water, to symbolize that the archangel is equally at home in the conscious or the subconscious. The water in the pool indicates the subconscious mind of man and the universe. On the bank of the pool are irises, a reminder that Iris was the Greek goddess of the rainbow. At the end of the path there is the crown of mastery and attainment.
This is the card of vibration, or radiant energy, of the tempering and modification of experience. Just as Key 4, the Emperor, is the foundation of the physical, so Key 14 is the foundation of the mind-adding to 4 the power of 10. Here Man has, in large measure, mastered his own thoughts and achieved mental balance. There is nothing in the cosmos but vibration, and all forms of vibration can be modified and managed by the adept. But we do nothing of ourselves alone. Our guardian angel makes the tests and trials that lead us along the path of attainment.
As we learn to transfer the Life-force from the imagination (moon) into the activity of the conscious (sun), the will is developed and the imagination purified so that in pouring from the silver cup to the golden one we lose nothing. This is another of the stages of occult progress that the Fool must take on the path to mastery.

The Devil is the polar opposite of the Archangel in Key 14. His horns are those of a goat, and his face is a goat's face; he has bat wings and donkey ears that suggest the obstinacy and stubbornness of materialism. He sits on a half-cube, which signifies the half-knowledge of what is only the visible, sensory side of reality. His right hand is upraised, giving the sign of black magic, as opposed to the Hierophant's, which is raised in blessing. On the palm is the symbol of Saturn, the planet of limitation and inertia. In his left hand he holds the smoldering torch of destruction; the inverted pentagram, denoting evil intent, is inscribed above his forehead. Chained to the half-cube are two nude figures similar to those in Key 6. The tail of the man represents the wrong use of the signs of the Zodiac; the woman's tail resembles a bunch of grapes, suggesting the wrong use of the wine of life. There is no Devil except of man's own creation, and here it is evident that men are chained by their own wrong choices. However, the chains about their necks are loose and can be removed at will.
**Divinatory Meaning:** Black magic, discontent, depression. Illness. Wrong use of force. Bondage to the material; sensation divorced from understanding.","### Reversed

This is the Tower of ambition built on false premises. It is made of the bricks of traditional race-thought and the wrong use of personal will. Streaks of lightning issue from the Sun; the crown of materialistic thought falls from the Tower. The lightning is also the Divine fire that destroys only what is evil and purifies and refines what is good. The falling drops of light or dew, seen here as well as in Key 18 and in the Aces of three suits of the Minor Arcana, are Hebrew Yods. They signify the descent of the Life-force from above into the conditions of material existence. The man and woman are falling from their tower of material security, after a brilliant glimpse of Truth. We see here the Cosmic Consciousness struggling to break through man's thoughts of material ambition and bring them to naught in order that he may build again. When man sells his soul to the devil and uses his occult knowledge for evil ends, then destruction descends upon him from above. Key 16 has been associated with the fall of Satan's kingdom. This tower is built upon a foundation of misapprehension. ""Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.""

A beautiful maiden kneels with one knee on the land and one foot in the water. The earth supports her weight, but she balances herself on the water of the subconscious. She is the Empress and Mother Nature pouring the waters of life onto the material earth. The five rivulets represent the five senses before they run into the pool of the Universal Consciousness. From the other pitcher she pours directly into the pool, which is stirred into vibration by meditation. Behind the maiden the sacred ibis of thought rests on a tree (mind). In the sky are seven small eight-pointed stars and a large one, all representing radiant cosmic energy. The seven smaller stars correspond to the seven chakras of the body.
This is the key of meditation, showing us that meditation modifies and transmutes the personal expressions of cosmic energy that pour down upon the maiden. If we will but listen, the Truth will unveil itself to us in the silence. From the record of nature's memory, symbolized by the scroll of the High Priestess, we gain wisdom, out of which meditation develops specific powers by controlling the animal forces in human personality-as pictured in Key 8.

The Moon in three phases watches over the landscape. From the pool of Cosmic Mind stuff in the foreground, a crayfish appears, symbolizing the early stages of conscious unfoldment. The wolf is nature's untamed creation; the dog is the result of adaptation to life with man. In the background, halfway up the path, are the twin towers Man has erected to protect himself from his hostile environment. The Moon will lead him along the rugged path, past the towers, to the final heights of attainment, if he will be guided by her reflected light and listen to the voice of his subconscious. Once again, the falling drops are Yods, representing the descent of the Life-force from above into material existence.
This is the key of sleep and dreams. The Moon's three phases of intuition concern body, mind, and spirit. The Moon Mother watches over the birth of Spirit into material manifestation. The number 18 consists of the digits 1 and 8, which add up to 9, thus becoming the second 9 and indicating the second initiation. The Hermit was the first 9 on the path.

A naked child rides a white horse and holds a red banner aloft. The horse is solar energy, which he now controls without saddle or bridle. He represents perfect control between the conscious and the unconscious. His red banner signifies action and vibration, as do the rays of the Sun-so different from the quiet, reflected light of the Moon. He carries the banner in his left hand to indicate that control has now passed from the conscious (right hand) into the subconscious (left hand)-just as, while we are learning to play the piano or ride a bicycle, we use the conscious part of our minds, but when we have learned, we pass control over to the subconscious. The expert pianist can carry on a conversation while playing an intricate piece, and the youthful bicyclist shouts, ""Look, Ma, no hands.""
The walled garden behind the child is the cultivated garden of Man, which he has left behind him. There are four sunflowers looking toward him for their full development, instead of toward the sun. They represent the four elements-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.
The child is fair, like the Fool, and, like the Fool, he wears a wreath and a red feather. His nakedness indicates that he no longer has anything to hide. Here the Fool has gained spiritual victory over the lower aspects of his nature-a very different triumph from that which he was demonstrating as the Charioteer in Key 7, when his conquest was only over his own will. The number 19 is associated in mythology and legends as the number of the Sun. One who has attained to 19 becomes a Sun initiate, ready to accomplish for humanity on the inner planes what the Sun accomplishes in giving light and warmth to the earth.

The angel Gabriel emerges from the heavens blowing on his bannered trumpet, its seven basic tones indicated by the seven lines radiating from it. This imperious blast is the creative Word that liberates Man from his terrestrial limitations. The cross on the banner is the solar symbol of the balance of the coffins float on the sea of Cosmic Mind stuff, which is the ultimate goal of those streams and pools that began in the High Priestess and passed through many forms. Snowy mountains beyond the sea are the heights of abstract thought. ""The hour cometh and now is in which all they which are in the tombs [of human belief] shall hear his voice and shall arise.""
This is the reawakening of Nature under the influence of Spirit, the mystery of birth in death. The man arising from the tomb of world belief is again the conscious, the woman the subconscious, the child the regenerated personality. Spirit has now fully clothed itself in Man, the Word has been made flesh and dwells amongst us. The one who has passed the tests (including the crucial last test) is always called the ""twice-born.""
Key 20 is composed of two complete cycles of 10, each containing the experience of the 9 digits. But unlike the first 10, in which 1 stands before the 0 of unmanifest forces, here we find 2, signifying that the Life-force entered into matter and was multiplied. ""The Power belongs to him who knows,"" and he who knows is then responsible. Therefore the Fool is the one who by effort and suffering has found the secrets of life.

Here we see a dancer clad only in a scarf. An oval wreath frames her figure, symbolizing the mystery of creation. The ribbons twined around the wreath again suggest the cosmic lemniscate. The four beasts at the four corners of the key, a slightly different version of those in Key 10, represent the four elements of Air, Fire, Water, and Earth, which have here been balanced and become the cornerstones of life.
The legs of the dancer form a cross, as do those of the Hanged Man, but the triangle he represented was under the cross, signifying that he was still bound by earthly things. Here, a triangle is formed pointing upward from the dancer's hands to the top of her head. Thus the triangle of Spirit now surmounts the cross of the material . The dancer's two wands represent the powers of involution and evolution, which she now possesses.
Though the dancer seems a female, some writers claim that a hermaphrodite is depicted in this Key, with the veil hiding the truth. This is thought by some to be the ideal state from which humanity came and to which it returns. This attainment is the merging of the self-conscious with the subconscious, and the blending of these two with the superconscious-the final state of Cosmic Consciousness, the supreme goal to which all the other keys have led.

# THE MINOR ARCANA

The Minor Arcana are believed by some to be of even more ancient origin than the Major Arcana. Since both had already been combined into one pack at the time when Court de Gébelin brought them to public attention, there is no way of confirming or disproving this supposition. Indeed, there are some writers on the subject who disregard the Minor Arcana, concentrating entirely on the Major Arcana—especially as they relate to the Tree of Life of the Kabalah. Continued research, however, reveals that the meanings of the Minor Arcana show an unmistakable correspondence to those of the ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. (This relationship will be discussed in the section on the Tarot and the Kabalah.)

A. E. Waite's Rider Pack was chosen for this book because it was the only pack we could find that had an illustration for each of the 56 cards of the Minor Arcana. The mind more easily retains the memory of the meaning of a card after one has looked at a graphic representation rather than at merely the number of symbols in a design—say, three Pentacles, nine Swords, or six Cups.

The universe, it has been said, was created from four basic elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, corresponding to the four Hebrew letters IHVH (Jehovah). In ancient Hebrew there were no written vowels, and these letters represented forms of the verb ""to be,"" used with that, not *he*, for the letters IHVH are a symbol for the Conscious Energy that brings all things and all creatures into existence. ""I"" stands for the element Fire, ""H"" for Water, ""V"" for Air, the life breath, and the final ""H"" for the solidity of the element Earth.

The four suits of the Minor Arcana—Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles—also correspond with IHVH and the four elements, so we have:

|   |       |           |
| - | ----- | --------- |
| I | Fire  | Wands     |
| H | Water | Cups      |
| V | Air   | Swords    |
| H | Earth | Pentacles |

Each suit is made up of cards numbered from ace to ten, plus four Court cards: King, Queen, Knight, and Page. The Tarot, as has been mentioned, was the forerunner of the modern deck. If the Knights were left out and the suit names changed (Wands to clubs, Cups to hearts, Swords to spades, and Pentacles to diamonds), what remained would be virtually identical with our modern playing cards. Another similarity has already been noted: the complete deck of 78 cards contains an unnumbered card called the Fool, from which has evolved today's Joker, also unnumbered. The four suits of the Minor Arcana are represented by the four animals of the Apocalypse (see description in Keys 10 and 21 of the Major Arcana).",The World,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,255,1490

# HOW TO READ THE CARDS

Let us assume that you have a deck of Tarot cards, presumably the Rider Pack designed by A. E. Waite which is pictured in this book. After you have mastered the meanings of these cards, it will be relatively easy for you to use any of the decks now on the market, should you so desire.",King of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,118,676
the_complete_guide_to_the_tarot_tarot_main_the_high_priestess,The-Complete-Guide-to-the-Tarot_tarot,main,"## THE HIGH PRIESTESS AS AN EXAMPLE
Choose any card to meditate on that appeals to you, and when you have explored most of its possibilities, go on to the next one. I have chosen the High Priestess to use as an example-but not because this card is any better for meditation than any one of the others.
The High Priestess represents the subconscious mind, the instincts, emotions, memories-not only those of our own personal past but those of all mankind. The subconscious is also our link with the superconscious, our Divine Self, as brought out in Key 6, the Lovers. There we have the man representing the conscious mind looking to the woman, the subconscious, and she looks at the angel, the superconscious. We cannot bypass the subconscious in our search for the Divine within, and it is a good subject for our meditations.
The High Priestess sits between two pillars and is the balance between the positive and negative forces. The evil behind her has both male and female symbols on it-again balance. The Solar Cross at her breast repeating the same idea, for the positive (male) force in the vertical line, is equal to the negative (female) force of the horizontal line. Both are needed; both are equally important. In Diagram 4 of the Tree of Life, the fourth Sephiroth, Chesed, which builds up, is equally balanced with No. 5, Geburah, the force that breaks down. Do you see these two forces at work in the world around you? Do you see that both are necessary?
The Tree is divided into three pillars: the one on the left, Severity; on the right, Mercy; and between them the pillar of Harmony, the control between the two opposing forces. The High Priestess sits between a different version of these pillars, but her place in the middle is again that of harmony. The half-hidden scroll suggests the vast store of knowledge that is protected from those who do not approach the mysteries of life with the reverence that is their due.
These symbols can be a means of support to the mind as it advances through unknown and untried ways. They afford connecting links of thought that can carry the mind, without a break, from details to general principles. It is said that the subconscious mind cannot accept an absolutely new idea but must always relate new knowledge to something it has grasped before. Symbols, pictures, and diagrams give it a known concept to hang onto as thought proceeds from that which is understood into the vast unknown.
Using the Will to keep our minds centered on things of the Spirit-rather than on pushing or battling our way through the world-we begin, more and more, to achieve a charmed life. Our good flows to us through unexpected channels.
Through meditating on the Tarot, we begin to understand the evolution of Life and the Intelligence behind all manifestation, which we call God. We learn that on the physical plane there must be the tearing-down force (Geburah) as well as the building-up force (Chesed); that they must balance-not too much of any one species, or an opposing species will arrive to bring equilibrium. We see death as the necessary opposite of life, and God in each atom, each particle-the Life-force that never dies but reappears again and again, ever renewed, with its own inexhaustible Cosmic Energy.
We learn that to be an occultist is to be a ""little god"" with minor powers of creation. We can speak our word and it is done-as long as we have first acquired the knowledge of the workings of the Law of Cause and Effect, and work along with it.
The occultist never violates the laws of the universe but has learned to use them on a higher plane to create for himself the surroundings of his choice. He becomes the central Pillar of the Tree of Life, balancing the positive and negative elements, like the child in Key 20, the Sun, who rides forth at last from the walled garden of the cramped city of duality behind him, into the open and unexplored country of his own superconsciousness.
# SYSTEMS OF OCCULT THOUGHT THAT ILLUMINATE THE TAROT
The three sections that follow discuss the relation between the Tarot and Numerology, the Kabalah, and Astrology, respectively. They are presented for those who may wish to go more deeply into the underlying harmonies that exist in all realms of metaphysics. At times the connections may be a little blurred, and the occultist may seem to be straining to fit them into his own theories, but the correspondences are too many to dismiss lightly.
An understanding of these related disciplines will surely reward the seeker after knowledge of the Tarot. The point is that no one can confine a philosophy as potent as the Tarot to the straitjacket of rigid dogma, and that we should extract from all these storehouses perceptions that will enrich and expand insight into the mystic cards. Today, when the interest in all esoteric and metaphysical realms of thought is at an unparalleled peak of intensity, the attempt to reach a basic core of meaning that unites them-each enhancing the others-is an exhilarating experience. I hope that my readers will find it so.
# The Tarot and Numerology
>""The world is built upon the power of numbers."" -Pythagoras
>""Every cosmogony is based upon, interlinked with and most closely related to numerals and geometrical figures."" -H. P. Blavatsky
In studying the origin of numbers, we come upon the opinion that the Hindus, from whom Pythagoras is said to have gained his knowledge of numbers, considered them a sacred science of the priesthood, and that the priests themselves declared numbers to be a direct revelation of the gods. The Hebrews also attached significance to numbers, relating them to cosmic forces. They did not use separate systems of letters and numbers, but their letters were actually based upon numbers. They were placed in an order and given a form that would suggest the successive levels in the process of cosmic evolution. In both the Greek and Hebrew names in the Bible there is evidence of a very close relationship between literal and numerical meanings.
In the original Greek, ""Jesus"" is ""lesous"" (there is no ""J"" in the Greek alphabet). This name is the numerical equivalent of 888, which, to initiates, represents the ""Higher Mind"" or ""Divine Mind"" in the Greek Mysteries. ""Mortal Mind"" in Greek is the number 666 (referred to in Revelation as the ""beast"").
Thus, there is a universal language that speaks to us through numbers. The key to it is symbolism, the inner sense of which remains unchanged throughout human history. Numbers, as used in Numerology, are based on tens, the number 10 closing the first cycle, number 20 the second, and so forth. There are 9 digits and hence 9 root influences, but there are 10 separate characters. The universally accepted method of reducing the letters of the alphabet to numerical quantities, generally referred to as the ""Pythagorean"" method, is very closely allied to the older Greek, Roman, and Hebrew methods, and has been adapted to the English alphabet.
The numerical designations follow the order of the alphabet. The letters and their corresponding numerical values are indicated in the following table:
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i |
| j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r |
| s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z | |
It can be seen that the letter ""O"" the fifteenth letter of the alphabet, is given the value of 6 in the table. The reason for this is that the digits of 15 equal 6 (1 + 5 = 6). All double numbers are similarly reduced by being added into a single number.
The above list holds good for simple Numerology, but the Tarot Keys that are numbered above 9 embody both the meanings of their sequential number and the aggregate of their digits. For example, the Number 15 for the Devil, like 15 in the consecutive numbers, relates to eroticism. When the digits 1 and 5 are added together, making 6, this relates the Devil to Key 6, the Lovers. In the first instance, the suggestion is thought and action brought down to their lowest level; in the second instance we see thought lifted to the plane of the superconscious.
The decimal system was held sacred by the Egyptian priesthood, who declared they had received it directly from the Divine teachers of mankind. The whole evolution of the Cosmos and of man was said to be portrayed in the numbers from 1 to 10, but it was revealed only to those who had eyes to see. Number 10, being the sacred number of the universe, was secret-a system of counting by 125 was reserved for the common man.",,The High Priestess,major_arcana,upright,card_meaning,1541,8543

The ten Sephiroth operate from Nil to material manifestation through what the Kabalists called the Four Worlds or Stages. These are Atziluth, the world of archetypes where all begins to be something; Briah, where creation takes place; Yetzirah, where formation occurs; and Assiah, the material world. Each Sephirah then is, in a sense, divided into four sections in which each of the Four Worlds operates.
Thus we have the ten Sephiroth, the 22 Paths, the three Pillars, and the Four Worlds, and these relate to the Tarot cards in this way: The ten Sephiroth relate to the numbered cards 1 to 10 of the Minor Arcana; the Four Worlds to the four suits; the 22 Paths to the 22 cards of the Major Arcana.",,The World,major_arcana,upright,card_meaning,128,720

tarot_for_beginners_main_the_fool,Tarot-for-Beginners,main,"## 0. THE FOOL
ALSO KNOWN AS The Jester
KEYWORDS Leap of Faith, Innocence, Adventure
ELEMENT Air
The Fool is our sense of adventure, our inner child who sets out gleefully and impulsively to see the world and gain experience. The path of the Major Arcana is known as the Fool's Journey; each card represents a lesson or phase of life that The Fool experiences.
The Fool travels lightly on their journey, carrying all their belongings in just a small bundle. The Fool is hard to pin down. They are unknowable and endlessly playful. Just when we think we know something or have achieved anything, like a jester The Fool strips away pretensions and solid answers.
Pulling The Fool indicates taking risks and leaps of faith. The dog in this card symbolizes instinct and self-preservation, as well as social mores, which The Fool ignores. The dog tries to warn The Fool of the danger of stepping off the cliff, but The Fool ignores the little dog, because we must accept danger to go into the world.
Dreaming at the edges of cliffs and believing in only the best possibilities, the hopeful, idealistic Fool reminds us that it's never too late to follow our dreams. If you have pulled The Fool, enjoy your sense of play and optimism. Catch yourself before you do anything too foolhardy-but remember that confining yourself to convention is sometimes the silliest and most foolish thing a person can do.
### Mystic Meanings
The numerological significance of 0 points to infinite potential. The Fool has yet to become someone with an identity or role. Instead, The Fool's role is to reduce arrogance and insistence on rules down to zero.
Air is The Fool's element. The Fool is light on their feet, lighthearted, and idealistic-sometimes with their head in the clouds. Their sense of adventure propels them to scale great heights, ascending mountains up into the atmosphere.
In astrology, The Fool is associated with Uranus, the planet of individuality, originality, and breaking tradition. Uranus's energy is androgynous, like The Fool's.
### Posing a Question
Why am I feeling bored in my relationship with my partner?
In response to a question of matters of the heart, The Fool points to our inner child. It is essential for your health in all areas of life to feed your creativity and your sense of adventure and fun. In what ways is your current relationship neglecting or silencing your inner child? What needs to change? Once these issues are clear to you, you'll be better able to state your needs and find a solution that will renew your relationship.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
The Fool is a card of endless beginnings. If an Ace or Aces from the Minor Arcana also appear in a reading, the message of a new beginning is emphasized.
The Hierophant and The Fool always butt heads. They are the archetypes of convention and irreverence. Both cards appearing in a reading signifies conflict between these two forces in one's life.","### Reversed

Reversed, The Fool indicates that you are being either too impulsive or not impulsive enough. If you have been going overboard in your adventures, it is time to rein it in before anyone gets hurt. On the other hand, if you haven't gone out dancing or had a good laugh in a while, do something fun.",The Fool,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,503,2934
tarot_for_beginners_main_the_magician,Tarot-for-Beginners,main,"## I. THE MAGICIAN
ALSO KNOWN AS The Juggler
KEYWORDS Creativity, Manifestation, Ability
ELEMENT Quintessence
ASTROLOGY Mercury
NUMEROLOGY 1
The Magician makes things happen. The Magician always finds a way to manifest plans into reality. Their ability to envision what they wish to manifest, along with their conviction in manifesting it, gives them 360-degree vision, noticing opportunities and resources that others overlook or don't deem themselves worthy of pursuing. The Magician is optimistic and willing to take an unconventional route to manifest their vision: They care more about putting an idea into action than they do about what others may think of them along the way. If you have pulled The Magician for yourself, you are creative, flexible, and adaptive. You have strong concentration and the willpower to actualize your plans and goals.
### Mystic Meanings
The numerological significance of the number 1 is unity and power. The Magician has incredible power to manifest and create, in large part because The Magician does not see themself as separate from the rest of the universe. They tap into all available resources and inspiration to put plans into action. The Magician's element is actually ether, or quintessence, the alchemical denotation of the divine spirit that fills all four natural elements with life. Mercury is The Magician's astrological counterpart. Like The Magician, Mercury is the planet that helps everyday logistics, transportation, technology, and communication go smoothly.
### Posing a Question
I'm considering a career change. What will guide me in making this switch?
Pulling The Magician suggests that you are indeed embarking on a new beginning. New and positive career opportunities are coming to you. Choose between them with confidence-do not allow your vision to be limited by anyone or by your own self-doubt. The Magician urges you to have confidence in your vision for your new career and for your contribution to society. Weigh your job, internship, or education options according to how they will best support you to achieve this vision, not according to how prestigious or well-trodden certain paths may be. The right path for you might be an original one.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
The Chariot shares The Magician's concentration and clarity of purpose. Aces reinforce The Magician's meaning of opportunities and beginnings.
In opposition to The Magician, The Devil constrains our vision and narrows our possibilities. Minor Arcana cards of blockage or pause, such as the Two of Swords, inhibit The Magician's energy, but to a lesser degree than does The Devil.","### Reversed 
The Magician's power is either latent or being used without integrity. Watch out for someone who may be charming you in order to take advantage of you. Make sure you are only completing projects that have strong integrity and that your means of achieving your goals live up to the intended integrity of your project. Alternately, if you are feeling stuck and powerless, focus on the vision you want to achieve. You may be stuck because you are only considering conventional routes. What alternate routes or resources are available to you? Striking out on your own to achieve your goals, rather than allowing yourself to remain stuck because a path isn't being offered to you by someone else, will be worth the bouts of momentary confusion.",The Magician,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,415,2627

KEYWORDS Inner Knowledge, Intuition, Duality
ELEMENT Water
ASTROLOGY Moon
NUMEROLOGY 2
The High Priestess sits before a veil that divides the seen world from the unseen realms of feeling and spirituality. They are the gatekeeper of the knowledge that lies beyond the veil. They quietly and intuitively sense who to lead out of their daily reality into a deeper spiritual experience. Pulling The High Priestess indicates that you, or an important figure in your life, are deeply intuitive, even psychic. The High Priestess is a spiritual teacher (regardless of whether or not this is their title) who offers profound wisdom beyond the illusions of this life to those who are willing to open their eyes. A mystery is at hand. Something is hidden. You must solve this one by going inward. Then, like Persephone from Greek mythology returning to the land of the living, you must forge a bridge between your inner and outer life so that you can live in integrity with more serious truths. Since The High Priestess's alternate name, The Female Pope, does not denote an actual position within Catholicism, this card is suggestive of religious figures who do not conform to dominant or patriarchal religious structures. This card values spiritual ways of knowing that are private, personal, and possibly secret or hidden.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 2 carries the meanings of duality and balance. The High Priestess creates balance between her inner and outer life. Though the number 2 represents partnership, The High Priestess emphasizes our relationship with ourselves and our relationship with the divine. The High Priestess values privacy and solitude. Twos also represent choice. The High Priestess insists that we trust our gut when making a decision. The High Priestess is associated with the moon and with the element of water. The moon connects us to our subconscious, intuition, and emotions. It attunes us to our inner fluctuations, questions, and transformations. Our inner knowing is fluid and constantly changing. Like water, our intuition flows anywhere, taking whatever form it needs to, easily shifting and adapting amidst change. These facets of The High Priestess remind us to trust our inner knowing, even and especially inner knowing that precedes thought or subverts reason.
### Posing a Question
What is important for me to know about my romantic life at this time?
When you pull The High Priestess in response to a relationship question, the cards are telling you to focus on your connection with yourself and your spirituality. To do this, you need some degree of solitude. This solitude or separation doesn't have to be drastic, but The High Priestess does insist that, right now you prioritize nurturing your inner world over your romantic life.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
The Two of Swords supports The High Priestess's inward focus, intuition, and patience. The Moon is another card of intuition, though The Moon's focus is on instinct, while The High Priestess emphasizes calm inner knowledge.
Cards that represent entirely outward action and rational thought, such as the Knight of Swords, oppose The High Priestess.","### Reversed 
The High Priestess suggests secrets or secrecy. You may be keeping a secret in order to deceive someone, or someone is hiding something from you. You may be ignoring or denying your spirituality. Your intuition and premonition skills are latent, but you are brushing them off. Allow them to come to the foreground.",The High Priestess,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,522,3221
tarot_for_beginners_main_the_empress,Tarot-for-Beginners,main,"## III. THE EMPRESS
ALSO KNOWN AS The Mother
KEYWORDS Beauty, Motherhood, Creativity
ELEMENT Earth
ASTROLOGY Venus
NUMEROLOGY 3
The Empress is the creative state, embodied. She, he, or they are a mother, endlessly creative and absorbed in love and the sensuality of creativity. Inspiration knows no bounds. The Empress surpasses ordinary boundaries in many spheres of life. As a mother, pregnant with ideas or a child, they create through love. They nurture their children, relationships, ideas, and projects, and help all people in their life grow.
If you have pulled this card for yourself, you cherish your emotions as ways of knowing the world and connecting with yourself. You are connected to your body, and you luxuriate in sensual and aesthetic pleasure. The Empress's aesthetic sense is embodied in their comfortable throne marked with the symbol of Venus.
When The Empress becomes exaggerated or imbalanced, they care for others but neglect themself, they are overprotective or overindulgent with their children, or they use their role as mother to define their identity or to manipulate others.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, 3 is the number of synthesis and creativity: two things coming together to create a third, as two parents conceive a child or a comparison of two things creates a third element of metaphor. The dynamic balance of these three-part relationships concerns The Empress.
This archetype is embodied by the element of earth. The Empress, the mother, grounds us. She supports us and helps us know our roots. Venus, the planet of beauty and love, is associated with The Empress. The Empress finds, creates, and offers grounding through beauty and relationships.
### Posing a Question
I just started a neighborhood community group. How can I best serve these gatherings?
Pulling The Empress in answer to this question affirms your talent for fostering connection among people, leading others, encouraging the group's vision and growth, and bringing your natural sense of beauty, creativity, abundance, and joy to the group. These qualities are needed and valued in your community. Continuing to be a good leader will best serve the group
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
Cards of abundance, such as the Ten of Pentacles, emphasize The Empress's boundless creativity, fertility, and abundance. The generous, nurturing Empress conflicts with the miserly, fearful Four of Pentacles. However, cards of mature discipline and stability, such as The Emperor, complement the flowing Empress.","### Reversed 
The Empress indicates difficulty with motherhood. This might come about as infertility, being forced into motherhood, dealing with a stifling definition of motherhood or expectation to be nurturing, or difficulties in your relationship with your mother or mother figure.

The reversed Empress can also suggest a negative relationship with your body and sense of pleasure. The Empress, reversed, indicates you may be feeling a lack of abundance and struggling with creative blocks that result from denying your relationship with beauty, pleasure, art, and your inner child. Take some time to address this.",The Empress,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,397,2515
tarot_for_beginners_main_the_emperor,Tarot-for-Beginners,main,"## IV. THE EMPEROR
ALSO KNOWN AS The Grandfather
KEYWORDS Reliability, Fatherhood, Responsibility
ELEMENT Fire
ASTROLOGY Aries
NUMEROLOGY 4
The Emperor is your most reliable family member, friend, or community leader. They are the person you can always count on to take responsibility for getting things done, who will follow through on their word. While The Emperor's counterpart, The Empress, overflows with creative ideas and nurtures possibility, The Emperor deems which ideas are most viable and effective, and carries them out. The Emperor plans, delegates, structures, and carries out projects. While The Empress helps us experience timelessness and cultivate love and beauty, The Emperor helps us operate within a strict schedule and produce finite outcomes.
The arid canyon pictured in this card, with just a small river running through it, indicates that too much emphasis on order and structure alone can suck us dry. At their worst, The Emperor is a destructive, power-hungry, authoritarian leader. However, when we have a meaningful project to complete, and we work toward the common good, The Emperor gives us the discipline and wherewithal to achieve great things and provide support to many people.
If you have pulled The Emperor for yourself, you are in a position of authority or responsibility. Through self-discipline and reason, you are achieving ambitious aims that affect many people. Important decisions, final decisions, and last-minute decisions all fall on you. Pulling The Emperor can also indicate that you are working out questions relating to authority, systems, and power.
### Mystic Meanings
The numerological meaning of the number 4 is material achievement, structure, and order. As we see from the rams' heads on The Emperor's throne, this archetype is associated with Aries-an active, rationally minded, ambitious doer.
Associated with the element of fire, The Emperor has charisma and energy. This active, outer-world energy can either drive big ambitions, thereby sustaining big projects and productions, or this fire energy can cause destruction.
### Posing a Question
What do I need to be aware of in my leadership approach?
When you ask the cards about your responsibilities, authority, or leadership skills and receive The Emperor, you are encouraged to look into the areas in which more structure or accountability is necessary. Be discerning about what structure you can and should provide, and in what areas, ways, or situations you should allow your children, students, employees, or team members more room for discovery, exploration, relaxation, play, creativity, emotional health, interpersonal growth, and unconditional love. Reflect, also, on your own relationship to authority, possibly going all the way back to your relationship with your father or with a masculine parent figure.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
The Justice card reinforces The Emperor's values of reason and logic. The Hierophant shares with The Emperor an emphasis on structure. Although The Empress is considered an opposing card, The Empress's opposite qualities of creativity and new life complement The Emperor's stability and discipline. Appearing together, they often indicate an influential couple.

When The Emperor, reversed, reveals that the upright qualities of this card are latent in you or in your situation, it is time to become more assertive, decisive, and attentive to schedules, materials, and productivity. Alternately, the reversed Emperor can indicate a coup, revolution, or overthrowing of leadership. This might be a celebratory event, or it might feel like sabotage or indicate an undermining force in your life.",The Emperor,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,524,3454
tarot_for_beginners_main_the_hierophant,Tarot-for-Beginners,main,"## V. THE HIEROPHANT
ALSO KNOWN AS Pope, Teacher, Saturn
KEYWORDS Education, Knowledge, Religion, Conformity
ELEMENT Earth
ASTROLOGY Taurus
NUMEROLOGY 5
The Hierophant interprets, protects, and teaches sacred mysteries. The keys at their feet indicate that they hold the keys to unlocking wisdom, spiritual truths, or the kingdom of heaven. These keys have been codified within institutions of tradition, spirituality, and knowledge or any organization or community formed to preserve, develop, and share knowledge.
In the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, The Hierophant is depicted as a pope, but can be any benevolent and compassionate spiritual or intellectual leader. In ancient Greece, a hierophant was anyone who introduced others to holiness. If you have pulled The Hierophant for yourself, you are someone who serves as a moral compass for others. Your intellect, tradition, and knowledge allow you to bridge heaven and earth, reminding everyone in your life of the unity of divinity and earth, the unity of our souls and bodies.
As a bridge between spiritual and material worlds, The Hierophant offers blessings and sacraments, such as marriage and last rites, and generally communicates the divine to their students and followers.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 5 represents healing, as well as the link between spirit and humankind. The Hierophant's Greek mythological association is the centaur Chiron, referred to as the wounded healer. Associated with Taurus, an earth sign, The Hierophant offers us spiritual grounding. Just as a Taurus promotes harmony but can be stubborn in their methods, The Hierophant insists that conformity to tradition is the ticket to harmony.
### Posing a Question
I am at a crossroads. What do I need to be aware of to make my next move?
Pulling The Hierophant in answer to this question suggests going to an academic, religious, or professional mentor or to an institution of teaching and learning for growth, development, and answers. Rather than relying on speculation or pure intuition, it's time to learn facts and skills and become versed in a tradition. Stay aware of your relationship to conformity, but overall, seek and offer mentorship through a spiritual tradition or academic institution. Right now, a conventional path will get you where you need to go.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
If both The Emperor and The Hierophant appear in a reading, structure is an important issue or theme. Combined with the Four of Wands, The Hierophant indicates marriage or the completion of a period of spiritual or educational training. The free spirits, The Hanged Man and The Fool, often indicate conflict with The Hierophant's institution.","### Reversed

Reversed, The Hierophant can reveal criticism, poor leadership, bad advice, and being misled by an egotistical authority figure. On the other hand, The Hierophant, reversed, can represent a free-spirited visionary, giving you permission to forge your own path.",The Hierophant,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,425,2693
tarot_for_beginners_main_the_lovers,Tarot-for-Beginners,main,"## VI. THE LOVERS
ALSO KNOWN AS Love, Marriage
KEYWORDS Connection, Fulfillment, Love, Choice
ELEMENT Air
ASTROLOGY Gemini
NUMEROLOGY 6
The Lovers indicate a time of life-changing connection and love. Not limited to erotic or romantic love, this card encompasses the experience of merging with a larger consciousness through ideas, spirituality, or interpersonal love. To reach such heights of meaning and depths of love, we have to make choices about where we invest our devotion-otherwise, we get trapped on the surface, scattered amongst our options, feeling indecisive and unfulfilled.
If you have pulled The Lovers, you know that you have made or are about to make a commitment that allows you to reach a deeper level of experience. The object of your commitment and desire can range from a person, job, or role in your community to a project of art or thought. Whatever or whomever you commit to, your merging will lead you to a higher consciousness and a feeling of spiritual connection with all beings.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, 6 is the number of harmony, integration, and passivity. The Lovers indicates intimate harmony and integration with another person, cause, ideas, or beliefs. We are humbled by this experience, and we become ""passive"" in the sense that we get out of our own way to openly receive the gifts of love.
The Lovers are associated with the element of air. Love (whether for a person, a cause, a project, or something else) gives us access to a higher, collective consciousness. This is the air element: elevating and transcendent.
In astrology, The Lovers are associated with Gemini, twins who comprise one person and embody duality. Geminis show us that oneness is multifaceted and that unity and love are possible through joining difference. Additionally, choice and decisions are often concerns for Geminis, individuals who must make decisions for the benefit of both sides of themselves, the way that in relationship and partnership we must make decisions with the best interest of the whole at heart.
### Posing a Question
I feel as if I need to take the day off from work. What's the likely consequence if I do?
If you receive The Lovers when asking about the consequences of an option you are considering, you can expect that choosing that option will bring you connection, inspiration, and a feeling of love. It might also suggest that this option will eventually present you with more options and possible temptations to choose from. In this case, taking the day off work will likely bring a day of fulfillment-just watch your relationship to temptation!
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
In combination with The Lovers, The Hierophant offers a message supportive of marriage and commitment. The Two of Cups with The Lovers supports connection, love, and mutual fulfillment. The solitude of The Hermit can mitigate the bond reflected by The Lovers.","### Reversed 
The Lovers indicate that a partnership or a creative, moral, or intellectual passion is not being honored. You or your partner is tempted by other influences. Whereas The Lovers, upright, indicates the importance of making decisions that honor depth of love, The Lovers, reversed, indicates uncertainty, confusion, disrespect, or betrayal. Be sure to honor the spirit of love in action and intention, whatever this may mean for you, and not just in appearance. Now is a time to take a deep breath and grow beyond past circumstances or temptations.",The Lovers,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,478,2895

ALSO KNOWN AS Victory, Triumphal Car
KEYWORDS Momentum, Breakthrough, Travel
ELEMENT Water
ASTROLOGY Cancer
NUMEROLOGY 7
Pulling things together is a major theme of The Chariot. This card features symbols from preceding cards in the Major Arcana. The wings on the chariot signify The Lovers' passion and higher purpose, the charioteer's wand reminds us of The Magician's power to manifest, the starry crown and canopy evoke the creativity of The Empress, the stone chariot mimics the throne of the sharp-minded, decisive Emperor, and the crescent shoulder plates mirror The High Priestess and her intuition.
If you have pulled The Chariot for yourself, you have the presence of mind to arrange all the elements of your life to run smoothly together, balancing opposing pieces of your life to give you momentum. Though you may have experienced a breaking point recently, things are now coming together. The dark and light sphinxes on this card signify opposites and the way you are able to reconcile these to unleash teamwork. The rush of excitement fuels your days.
### Mystic Meanings
The numerological meaning of the number 7 is spirituality and tests. The Chariot's momentum is both intuitive and preconceived: You are filled with and driven by a spiritual purpose, and you cleverly navigate the tests and challenges that crop up along your way. Your spiritual momentum at this time may actually be coming from the tests you have endured.
The Chariot's element is water. The Chariot is all about flow. Sometimes it can carry the feeling of a dam breaking open, of pent-up energy finally being released and channeled into more exciting, adventurous, creative use. When you pull The Chariot, your life is a river with a swift current.
Astrologically, The Chariot is associated with the zodiac sign Cancer. Like their symbol the crab, Cancers are sensitive inside and protect themselves with a tough shell. The Charioteer's shell is their intellect, while much of their inner experience is emotional, intuitive, and spiritual.
### Posing a Question
What should I keep in mind while I search for a new home?
If you receive The Chariot in answer to a question about settling down, you may want to hold off making a firm decision right now. This is likely a time of travel, breakthroughs, and motion for you, so considerations about settling down might be best saved for later. However, if you're convinced that now is the time to search for a home, make sure your home, like one of The Chariot's sphinxes, balances an opposite element of your life. Look for a home that will serve as a peaceful, stable counterpoint to your life's adventures. Your home should be in a location that does not hinder your access to your outer-world life.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
The Chariots victory is emphasized by success cards, such as the Ace of Swords and The World.
Cards that indicate a pause oppose The Chariot, including the Two of Swords, The Four of Cups, and The Hanged Man.","### Reversed
The Chariot's swift and directed momentum is either thwarted or spirals out of control when reversed. Addiction, indulgence, or egotism replace spirituality, and the path becomes filled with disappointments. Although The Chariot's upright qualities are latent at this time, they are present as potential. Ask for help to get yourself on a healthy and creative path, and convince yourself to take the reins of your life.",The Chariot,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,504,2996
tarot_for_beginners_main_strength,Tarot-for-Beginners,main,"## VIII. STRENGTH
ALSO KNOWN AS Lust, Fortitude
KEYWORDS Compassion, Perseverance, Power
ELEMENT Fire
ASTROLOGY Leo
NUMEROLOGY 8
Strength depicts a maiden taming a lion through compassion. By treating the lion with kindness and gentleness, the lion understands that he is safe and loved. His aggression melts away, and when the maiden places her hand near his mouth, he doesn't bite. The Strength card indicates any situation in which we achieve great things, earning respect and power, through kindness and love.
The Strength card represents a vision that is so strong, others can easily understand its purpose and willingly join in. The maiden has a vision of harmony, which she invites the lion into. If you have pulled the Strength card, your vision may be a business, a family, a community initiative, or any creative project. This card assures you that your vision is possible to achieve and worth the effort of doing so. It will have a profound effect in the lives of many people.
The lemniscate, the sideways figure eight hovering above the maiden's head, symbolizes eternity. Its ceaselessness gestures to the perseverance involved in sustaining a vision, and negotiating with others to become part of the vision and create a new reality.
In addition to emotional and mental strength, this card represents physical strength and vitality. However, as the maiden's kindness calms the ferocity of the lion, Strength suggests a disciplining and channeling of urges and impulses. We cannot get rid of our animal impulses and needs-the lion still must kill to eat; food, sex, and power are desires that will not go away-however, Strength shows us how to use our vitality for the common good, as much as this is possible.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 8 represents navigation, prosperity, and authority. Strength represents success, power, and compassionately navigating social (and internal) dynamics. The element of fire is associated with this card; it illuminates Strength's passion, persistence, and confidence. Strength's astrological link is the zodiac sign Leo, the lion. Leos are firm in their beliefs and they love hard-passionately, loyally, and protectively.
### Poising a Question
The team leader of my project isn't open to my ideas. How can I get through to them?
In general, the Strength card emphasizes strength of vision. If you pull this card in answer to this question, think about the outcome you would like. Spend a little time getting clear about your vision. Tap into your confidence that the outcome you have in mind would benefit everyone involved. Set a meeting with the team leader to discuss the issue at hand. Start by finding common ground, the way the figure in the Strength card acknowledges the lion with kindness, and negotiate from there, staying true to your vision.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
Temperance reinforces Strength's balance. Combined with the Ten of Wands, Strength emphasizes a big vision or task that will require much physical and emotional strength to accomplish. Cards in which our subconscious impulses overrun our consciousness, as in The Moon, or in which physical urges overturn our discipline, as in The Devil, combat the balance and discipline of Strength.","### Reversed 
Reversed, Strength signals that you are being either too forceful or too passive in response to conflict. Channel the upright qualities of this card, compassion and gentle confidence, rather than adding to the violence of the situation or letting violence be carried out against you.",Strength,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,524,3240

ALSO KNOWN AS The Elder, Time
KEYWORDS Wisdom, Seeker, Inner Voice
ELEMENT Earth
ASTROLOGY Virgo
NUMEROLOGY 9
The Hermit is an elder who embodies wisdom and discretion. Their age gives them distance from the bustling world. The lamp they carry represents their inner voice, which they honor and explore. Regardless of your age, if you have pulled The Hermit for yourself, you are an old soul and a seeker of inner healing, wisdom, and truth.
You are on a pilgrimage to find your inner voice or spiritual truths. What questions have you been asking, and who or what are you seeking out in search of answers? Your pilgrimage might be a religious or spiritual one, or it might simply be about finding ways to make your daily life more meaningful, such as setting aside more time for daily walks or meditations, so you can hear yourself think.
How you spend your time is one of The Hermit's concerns. What are the most meaningful activities in your life right now? Spending enough time by ourselves is important for us to hear the guidance of our inner wisdom and our divine inner voice. However, pulling The Hermit does not necessarily indicate spending most of your time alone, but rather that you spend your time doing meaningful things with people you resonate with. Teachers may be particularly important right now. Overall, you are able to prioritize your inner or spiritual life.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 9 represents completion and achievement of goals. As an elder or an old soul, The Hermit feels a sense of completion and achievement in their life. Nine is also a number of meditation, an important practice of The Hermit. The Hermit's spiritual search is not idealistic, emotional, or socially active. Rather, it is grounded. The element of earth indicates that The Hermit takes their time to make their journey and uses material resources respectfully. The Hermit is associated with the zodiac sign Virgo. Like The Hermit, Virgos have a gentle attunement to awe and wonder.
### Posing a Question
What can I do to engage my disinterested students?
The Hermit emphasizes meaningful endeavors. They value exploring their inner world and seeking wisdom over superficial pastimes and busywork. The Hermit suggests your students need to find the material more meaningful and personally relevant. Find ways to help them connect personally to their studies so they can embody the spirit of The Hermit's pursuit of meaning.
Additionally, you might be in a time of seeking and questioning your own path and teaching methods. Bring curiosity and faith to your own path and to the classroom. Also seek the help of a mentor to guide you through your situation.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
Cards of meditation and reflection, such as The High Priestess and the Four of Swords, emphasize The Hermit's spiritual practice of inward exploration. The Hermit is compatible with The Hierophant as a teacher.
Cards of celebration, such as the Nine of Cups and the Four of Wands, hinder The Hermit's solitary peacefulness.","### Reversed
The Hermit, reversed, signifies that you might be too adamant about securing your alone time, setting your schedule, and giving off the appearance of pursuing a spiritual practice. What can you let go of, instead, to create more room to experience awe?

Alternately, you may be ignoring the wisdom your inner voice or a wise person in your life has been trying to share. You have the potential to gain much wisdom in your life right now, but only if you actively seek out a path of learning and reflection.",The Hermit,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,512,3053

ALSO KNOWN AS Fate, The Wheel
KEYWORDS Change, Patterns, Fortune
ELEMENT Fire
ASTROLOGY Jupiter
NUMEROLOGY 10, Reduces to 1
The Wheel of Fortune represents seasons and changes of fate. We spend our lives cycling through bouts of good and bad luck, times of joy and times of grief. We can learn to respond compassionately to turns for the worse and take responsibility for our actions in all situations, but oftentimes, we really cannot control what circumstances befall us. The Wheel of Fortune likely indicates an unexpected change of fate. The Wheel of Fortune reminds us that nothing stays stable for long, but that history and patterns do repeat themselves and what goes around comes around.
You may be coming to recognize and understand your own patterns as well as those of the people and world around you. You are gaining both agency and acceptance, or equanimity. You are becoming more able to recognize what is yours to change and what issues you ultimately must leave up to fate or to the divine.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 10 indicates both growth and repetition. When the digits are added together, the number 10 reduces to 1, the number of unity, beginnings, and power, and points to The Magician's volition and all-encompassing perspective. The Wheel of Fortune is always turning. It is the crucible in which pieces of ourselves and our lives are destroyed and created anew. The Wheel of Fortune's astrological association, Jupiter, reinforces this card's meanings of money and fortune, as Jupiter is the planet of abundance and expansion.
### Posing a Question
My life feels like it's falling apart. How can I pull it back together?
In response to this question, the Wheel of Fortune advises you to focus on the patterns you know to be true in yourself and in your life. These patterns help you know the actions you can take, which will most likely take hold. This is not the time for wishful thinking, but rather for acting on what you know to be true through experience. Pay attention to cause and effect. This is a growing-up moment. You have an incredible opportunity to break a cycle. You can do this by taking responsibility for your own perspective and for the way you respond to change. Every situation is impermanent, including times of chaos or loss.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
The Wheel of Fortune's meaning of breaking a cycle is reinforced by The Chariot (the breakthrough card) and, to a lesser extent, the Seven of each suit of the Minor Arcana. Death or The Tower combined with the Wheel of Fortune emphasize the meaning of unexpected, fateful change. Cards of stagnation appearing with the Wheel of Fortune indicate a resistance to change. The Four of Pentacles and the Four of Cups are two such cards.","### Reversed
The reversed Wheel of Fortune indicates that things have come to a standstill or, perhaps, closure. Be aware of whether you are trying to resist fate.

ALSO KNOWN AS Adjustment
KEYWORDS Balance, Objectivity, Fairness, Equity
ELEMENT Air
ASTROLOGY Libra
NUMEROLOGY 11, Reduces to 2
Justice describes fairness, equity, and balance being restored to the extent that this is possible. In this card, the figure weighs the situation's various considerations (represented by the scales) and uses a clear, rational, objective mind (represented by their sword) to choose the correct course of action.
Part of Justice's balancing act involves balancing out their personal opinions and biases with objective awareness. Justice also maintains the ability to respond to the moral and practical demands of the situation at hand, while remaining true to ourselves. The curtain behind Justice gestures toward the realms of cosmic justice that govern karma, the law of cause and effect, better than humans can, but whose laws we aim to channel in our own dealings with justice.
Justice is also a card of making adjustments, specifically the adjustments that happen in moving from the abstract to the specific. Enacting fairness and creating balance and equality requires adjusting our understanding of rules, laws, and moral codes to assess the specifics of a particular situation. Following the Wheel of Fortune, Justice also describes the adjustments we must make in our lives following a change of fate. If you have pulled the Justice card, you are likely making decisions that restore balance to a disrupted life or an unfair situation.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, 11 is a sacred number of spiritual insight. When the digits are added together, the number 11 reduces to 2, the number of duality, balance, fairness, choice, and partnership. Associated with the element of air, Justice is rational. There is a feeling of weightlessness to Justice's objectivity. Justice's astrological link to Libra, the scales, resonates with Libra values of balance and fairness.
### Posing a Question
What is the deeper issue beneath the argument I had with my partner?
If you have pulled Justice, you and your partner likely experienced a major life change in the recent past, and you are both making adjustments. Be fair with each other and communicate frequently about what you each are going through. To reestablish equilibrium between you, make your adjustments day by day, check your assumptions about your partner's actions, and move forward in ways that promote fairness and equality between you. As Justice represents balance and reason, it is especially important at this time for you each to know your own needs and to take care of yourselves, as well as one another.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
Like Justice, The Emperor is concerned with rational order and real-world duty. Cards of outer-world balance, like the Two of Pentacles, and rational-minded fairness, such as the Queen of Swords, also support Justice.
Cards of oppression, such as The Devil or the Ten of Swords, or competition, such as the Five of Swords, oppose Justice.","### Reversed
Reversed, Justice indicates undue feelings of injustice. Even though things haven't turned out in your favor, the outcome of this situation is actually best and most fair for everyone involved. At an extreme, this lack of perspective manifests as so many forms of prejudice, bias, and injustice. Corruption, opportunism, injustice, racism, xenophobia, sexism, ableism, transphobia, misogyny, heterosexism, and homophobia are just a few examples.",Justice,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,480,2992

ALSO KNOWN AS The Hanging Man
KEYWORDS Trust, Self-Sacrifice, Waiting
ELEMENT Water
ASTROLOGY Neptune
NUMEROLOGY 12, Reduces to 3
The Hanged Man embodies trust in the universe. If you have pulled The Hanged Man, your trust and faith are being tested. Your life feels like it is in suspense. You are having trouble moving forward because either you can't trust those around you or you don't trust the possibility that things could work out for you.
However, you know (or are learning) what you believe in, what you are devoted to, and what sense of faith will carry you through. This card teaches that spiritual support is real and tangible. The Hanged Man is thought by some to be hanging from the Tree of Life, suggesting that no matter how hard or how far you fall, you are still in the universe and the universe will catch you.
The Hanged Man's upside-down perspective is unconventional. From your perspective, which is based in spiritual rather than worldly truths, you see what others can't. You see beyond illusions and mainstream paradigms to creative solutions, love, beauty, and the divine. Your unconventional perspective may be unsettling or aggravating to some, who may retaliate with condemnation and persecution. However, you are on your path to the ultimate freedom, attainment, and celebration.

As a figure who is paused and waiting, The Hanged Man exists beyond time, suspended in timeless truths. In numerology, the number 12 gestures to time-the year divided into 12 months and into 12 signs of the zodiac-and the fact that The Hanged Man may be able to see all of time at once. The Hanged Man's element is water, indicating a spiritual and emotional time. The Hanged Man is associated with Neptune, the planet of subtlety and spiritual perception.
### Posing a Question
I don't feel supported by my family. Am I doing something wrong?
It's important to understand the reasons you feel unsupported have nothing to do with anything you have ""done wrong."" Pulling The Hanged Man indicates that you tend to act with an awareness of a reality beyond this one and with a belief in the divine. You may frequently question your own spiritual perceptions, but it's important to understand that your family feels unsure of how to react to your truths and inner freedom. Continue to believe what you believe, as doubt will get you nowhere.
Trust is an important issue for The Hanged Man. Do what you can to foster trust between yourself and your family. Help them understand you, and remain open and curious about them and how you all can connect.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
Along with The Hanged Man, the Two of Swords emphasizes a time of pause to go inward to connect with intuitive truths. The Hermits wisdom emphasizes that of The Hanged Man.
The Hierophants conventions and institutions clash with The Hanged Mans unconventional, creative, or iconoclastic truths. Cards of speed, urgency, and outward action-such as the Knight of Swords-detract from The Hanged Mans inward journey and subtle, inner convictions.","### Reversed
Reversed, The Hanged Man indicates hang-ups and injustices that plague your spirit, convincing you to lose trust in yourself or in the divine. The reversed Hanged Man can indicate despair that comes from being separated from your beliefs and truths. While the upright Hanged Man can be a card of self-sacrifice in the name of one's beliefs and convictions, this card reversed asks if you have been sacrificing yourself out of habit. Search deep within for your faith. It is there, and it is one thing you can trust to truly hold and support you.",The Hanged Man,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,517,3076

ALSO KNOWN AS Transformation
KEYWORDS Endings, Grief, Transformation, Rebirth
ELEMENT Water
ASTROLOGY Scorpio
NUMEROLOGY 13, Reduces to 4
Death is a card of endings, grief, and letting go. When we let go, we transform. Fear breaks down, unleashing love. The death that has occurred in this card is the death of a king. We see that his crown has been knocked off. Death suggests that we may have lost a degree of control, but, as we learned in The Hanged Man, we don't have to hold ourselves up all the time. Even when we lose the ability to control a situation, we can find trust in the divine. It is possible that we've secretly been longing to be free from a certain inner control mechanism that, possibly due to sorrowful circumstances, we are now released from.
The Death card reminds us that death doesn't mean one particular thing. The child in this card faces death with wide-eyed curiosity. The maiden turns away from death and laments. The bishop greets death solemnly. Just as the figures in the card each relate to death differently, none of us can predict what an ending will mean to us or how it will feel. This card, therefore, reminds us not to preemptively fear endings just because they are endings.
If you have pulled the Death card and fear the ending it represents, be patient with yourself in your fear, and remember to look beyond the fear to see the whole story. Death is a card of liberation and rebirth. Growth can be painful, but it is always worth it. Who do you want to become? What is the world you wish to live in? Believe in your transformation.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 13 is not an unlucky number; rather, it is a powerful number indicating the ability to confront truth and thereby transform. When the digits are added together, the number 13 reduces to 4, echoing The Emperor's acceptance of reality's hard facts. The stability of the number 4 offers us a feeling of resolution. Death's element, water, allows us to release our grief and pain through tears, helping us cleanse our spirit. Death's astrological association is Scorpio. Scorpios are fascinated by transformation, sometimes causing the death of a false way of thinking or being. Scorpios are calm in the face of change.
### Posing a Questions
I've always enjoyed being around people, but recently I've been experiencing anxiety in groups. What is underlying my fear?
If you have pulled the Death card in answer to this question, your identity (your armor) is in flux. You feel tender, but you are resilient, formed by coming through fire. Be gentle with yourself. Know that your sensitivity is due to getting used to your new self. Focus on the growth you must do, rather than temporary solutions for your anxiety. Time will soothe your self-consciousness, and you will once again enjoy being with others.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
If the Ten of Swords comes up in a reading along with Death, the cards are acknowledging the pain you are experiencing due to an ending. Be sure to acknowledge the emotional impact of this situation so that you can grieve and heal. The Wheel of Fortune emphasizes an ending that is fated or beyond your control. Don't guilt yourself about this ending. Instead, learn from what has happened, and move forward with a positive attitude.
There is no card that negates Death. The Fool, however, may be oblivious or blasé in the face of an important ending.","### Reversed
Death, reversed, suggests that you are refusing to accept an ending. You fall prey to worry, fear, and confusion, resisting your own transformation. Remember that you cannot control anything about this ending except for the amount that you grow from it and the beauty you make from your pain.",Death,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,597,3425

ALSO KNOWN AS Art
KEYWORDS Creativity, Art, Healing, Balance
ELEMENT Fire
ASTROLOGY Sagittarius
NUMEROLOGY 14, Reduces to 5
Temperance allows us to flourish emotionally, creatively, and spiritually, due to having all the elements of our life flowing together in harmonious balance. Temperance is the card of alchemy, art, and metaphors. It is about elements combining to heal an imbalance and create an experience that is more than the sum of its parts. The angel in this card pours water from a silver cup to a gold cup, combining elements. The water magically pours sideways, indicating that, in the creative zone, the impossible becomes possible.
This card's definition of temperance is not abstinence, but rather the right balance of elements. This principle is represented by the placement of the angel's feet: one on land, one in water. If you have pulled Temperance, you are encouraged to find or maintain balance. If you are struggling with addiction or imbalance, instead of forcing yourself to abstain from something, make improvements in other areas of your life so that they will provide you with the satisfaction you are looking for. Temper yourself by adding a practice or experience to your day, which is intrinsically fulfilling and helps balance out any destructive behaviors or influences.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 14 signals stability. As such, it indicates that emotions are not primary in the inspired state, but rather one of many qualities present. When the digits are added together, the number 14 reduces to 5, a dynamic number of change and mediation. This echoes Temperance's meaning of combining many different elements. Temperance's element is fire. This is a dynamic card in which elements are combined and creative or fiery chemical reactions take place.
The zodiac sign Sagittarius is associated with Temperance. People born under Sagittarius have many varied interests but are also very direct. Similarly, Temperance combines unique elements with specific aims in mind.
### Posing a Questions
I'm working under a tight deadline. What quality will help me complete my project on time?
If you have pulled Temperance in response to a quality you need to channel in order to help you achieve a goal, you are encouraged to find balance to successfully complete your task. Stay healthy through the big push of your deadline by nourishing yourself, getting enough sleep, and refraining from isolating yourself. Allow the flow of your creativity to guide and fuel you.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
The Star in combination with Temperance emphasizes Temperance's meaning of healing. Balance is emphasized by the Two of Cups and Justice.
The Fives of Wands and the Five of Swords indicate chaos and conflict, respectively. They both oppose the harmony of Temperance. The Devil's hedonism opposes Temperance's balance.","### Reversed
Temperance, reversed, indicates a lack of balance. This imbalance may be caused by indulgence or addiction, or else by deprivation, as in eating disorders or the rejection of your own emotions. Take steps to restore balance.",Temperance,major_arcana,both,card_meaning,461,2885

ALSO KNOWN AS Pan, Temptation, Captor of the Lost
KEYWORDS Vitality, Play, Temptation, Oppression
ELEMENT Earth
ASTROLOGY Capricorn
NUMEROLOGY 15, Reduces to 6
The devil figure in this card is the Greek god Pan. Half-goat, half-man, Pan was a revered god of nature, lust, play, and other pleasures of the flesh, such as music and food. In the fourth century, Christian theologians began to demonize Pan, adding goat horns to depictions of Satan. In the tarot, The Devil retains elements of playful, lusty, vital Pan, but also depicts what happens when materialism gets the best of us. The Devil encourages us to look at what seems inappropriate in our lives, either within ourselves or in situations we find ourselves part of. If you have pulled The Devil, you are asked to look closer at your mischievousness and sense of play. Are you being playful or provocative when it comes to rules and bondage? Are you bringing levity to grave situations, breaking down barriers and unnecessary rules to allow for pleasure and fun? What vital energy is coursing through you?
On the other hand, are you causing harm? Is this inappropriateness a case of manipulation or oppression, either by you or against you? Are you repressing, rejecting, or shaming any part of yourself or others? What are the dynamics of this situation? Is there a way to bring about freedom?
Another aspect of The Devil is that we sometimes believe we are trapped when, in fact, we are not. The chains around the necks of The Devil's minions are loose. They could take them off if they wanted. As shown on the card, they are chained by manipulation, greed, and their fears of taking responsibility for the negative aspects of themselves. They blame each other or The Devil for their negative actions. The Devil card asks us to face our fears and our shadow sides to free ourselves from their control.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 15 signifies imprisonment and antagonism. When the digits are added together, this reduces to 6. The couple depicted may look familiar-they also appear in The Lovers. The number 15 reveals the shadows and power struggles on the flip side of the harmony and passivity of The Lovers' number 6.
The half-goat figures of the zodiac sign Capricorn and The Devil are indefatigable creatures. They wield energy and strength, but both can get caught in their own negative expectations. Associated with the earth, they carry grounding, though potentially heavy, energy, pointing to the challenge of loosening their perspective so they can play.
### Posing a Questions
What is causing all this chaos in my life?
Pulling The Devil card in answer to this question can indicate a situation in which you feel trapped. Sometimes, pulling this card may mean that you have been putting up with a domineering partner, boss, roommate, or landlord-often due to financial constraints. The cause of the chaos in your life is likely due to real or imagined constraints that compel you to stay in an unhealthy situation. Ask yourself what keeps you in the impossible situations you're involved in. Consider if these constraints are real; If they are real, brainstorm how you could creatively or strategically escape them. Remember that The Devils other characteristic is playfulness. See if you can play your way out of these situations.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
The Nine of Cups combined with The Devil emphasizes overindulgence. The crisis of The Moon suggests an inner reckoning with Devilish base instincts, such as greed or a need for dominance. The moderation of Temperance contrasts with The Devil's hedonistic overindulgence and power-hungry restriction or oppression of others.

ASTROLOGY Mars
NUMEROLOGY 16, Reduces to 7
When something in our life isn't working-a habit, a job, a relationship-but we refuse to acknowledge the issues, we build an increasingly precarious tower held together with temporary solutions, wishful thinking, and denial. If we neither take the initiative to dismantle nor restore the shoddy tower, it will inevitably come crashing down. The Tower signifies a time of total destruction. The foundations we've relied upon, however dysfunctional, have been ripped out from underneath us. Freefalling, we may feel terror or despair.
If you have pulled The Tower, the gift here is that real solutions and solid foundations can be put in place now that an untenable situation is no longer sapping your energy. The Hindu deity Kali-the mother goddess who, out of love, destroys what doesn't work-has rid you of your own poison. Now is a time to purge, detox, and start afresh.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 16 is actually a positive one, signaling the release of pent-up feelings and a flow of creativity and love. When the digits are added together, the number 16 reduces to 7, the number of spirituality and tests, and resonates with the seventh card in the Major Arcana, The Chariot, a card of breakthrough.
The Tower's element is, unsurprisingly, fire. Fire illuminates that which it destroys. Through the act of destroying what does not work, The Tower both illuminates our learning and releases trapped energy, which we can now harness in order to act upon our learning.
Mars is the planet associated with The Tower. Mars is aggressive, but it is also passionate and sexual. When the tower of our fears and egotism breaks, our passion and vitality are released.
# Posing a Question
I got fired from my job and feel like a failure. What do I do now?
If you have pulled The Tower in answer to this question, explore the part of you that was secretly wishing to be free from this job. Focus on that part of your soul. Love that part of you. Now is the time to listen to that part of you that you had to shut out to stay in your job. Allow this passionate, energetic aspect of yourself to come back to life and fuel a new path of positive changes. The rest is water under the bridge.
# Supporting and Opposing Cards
The Death card is also a card of endings. When it appears along with The Tower, an all-encompassing transformation is undeniably taking place. The Ten of Swords combined with The Tower emphasizes the violence of all that comes crashing to an end in The Tower.
If combined with The Star, Temperance, or The Chariot, the upheaval of The Tower is mitigated by a feeling of release and a new sense of purpose.","### Reversed

ASTROLOGY Aquarius
NUMEROLOGY 17, Reduces to 8
Just as the stars can be used for navigation, The Star is our guiding vision or ideal that will always point us in the right direction. No matter how far we may be from reaching our vision, we know we are on the right path when we are heading toward it.
The Star helps us believe in miracles and allows us to connect with the magic of every day. The ibis in this card represents the Egyptian god Thoth. As the god of thought, language, and magic, Thoth reminds us of the power of our thoughts and words. The things we name are potent. Naming our ideals can breathe life into them. Our experience is rich with beauty and meaning.
If you have pulled The Star, now is a time for healing and rejuvenation. Offer yourself grounding and cleansing rituals. It is okay to face the naked truth of your vulnerability right now; you are beautiful, and you deserve to heal.
Be sure that your ritual, healing, and ideals are as grounding as they are purifying. At an extreme, The Star indicates naïveté. Don't get lost in visions of the future. Set goals and intentions that are personal, rather than abstract. Open yourself to awe in your daily life and relationships. You are an inspiration to many people.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 17 indicates quiet certainty, subtle strength. When the digits are added together, the number 17 reduces to 8, the number of strength. Your visions are strong, and you have the strength and perceptiveness necessary to carry through. The Star's element is air. This card unburdens us, uplifts us. We are able to feel a lightness of heart and spirit that may have previously eluded us.
In astrology, The Star is associated with the zodiac sign Aquarius. Aquarius people naturally inspire others with their idealism and their belief in possibility. The Star represents a person, situation, or ideal that fills you with a feeling of optimism.
### Posing a Question
I'm grieving the loss of a loved one. What will comfort me in my days of mourning?
If you pull The Star, a positive and inspired card, in answer to this question, it suggests you focus on the way your loved one can continue to be a guiding light for you and others. Spend time considering the visions this person had for the world. What did they inspire in those around them? What did they inspire in you? Honor your loved one by dedicating yourself to integrating these inspirations into the way you live your life. Think about how you can spread the light of your loved one's energy.
### Supporting and Opposing Cards
Temperance supports The Star, emphasizing balance, healing, and cleansing. The Six of Swords also supports The Star, emphasizing calmness.
The Tower, on the other hand, as well as the Nine of Swords, opposes The Star, suggesting that your glimpses of hope arrive amidst a time of upheaval and worry. Also, The Devil's overindulgence and power imbalance, in combination with The Star, suggest idealism that is over-wrought, indulgent, or forced upon others.","### Reversed
Reversed, The Star indicates naïveté and obliviousness. Are you relying on belief to the extent that your idealism replaces taking actual action toward your ideals?

The Moon indicates experiences that take place under the light of the moon or in the subconscious. Dreams, trespasses, sexuality, animal instincts and fears, confusion, illusion, crimes, and moments of internal crisis all lie within the realm of The Moon.
The wolf and dog howling at the moon in this card express the fine, yet important, line between domesticity and wildness. The image of the moon represents our instincts and our animal nature. It affirms our intuition, dreams, and spirituality, but also indicates our capacity for cruelty.
Our instincts often run on fear, represented here by the two windowless towers, fortresses of entrapment and the unknown. What did it take for us to become domesticated? How, in childhood, was cruelty used to tame our wildness?
The Moon, at its worst, can represent codependent or abusive relationship patterns learned in childhood and other terrible certainties, such as deep-set illusions of aloneness and expectations of violence, that reside in the core of our consciousness. If you have pulled The Moon, you may be experiencing a crisis of faith or a dark night of the soul-but also your animalistic survival instinct and drive that will pull you through to meet the daylight.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 18 represents gentle exploration of vulnerability and the unknown, of hidden matters unfolding. When the digits are added together, the number 18 reduces to 9, a number of meditation, abundance, and achieving goals.
The Moon's element is water. Water represents the expression of emotions, as well as the malleability and fluidity of our consciousness.
The Moon's astrological link is to the zodiac sign Pisces. Pisces folks value healing, intuition, intimacy, and boundaries. The Moon similarly encompasses the fluidness of boundaries, teaching us the sometimes subtle differences between intimacy and violence, and helping us heal our boundaries.
### Posing a Questions
Why do I keep finding myself in unhealthy relationships?
If you have pulled The Moon in response to this question, you are encouraged to look deeply at old patterns embedded since childhood in your subconscious understanding of the world. Seek support, and be gentle with yourself. Old wounds cut deep, but you are strong and willing to heal. Recognizing and learning about your wounds is more than half the struggle. There will be sunnier days ahead.

On a sunny day when the weather is just right, we often can't help but feel joyful. The Sun represents the joy that the sun naturally brings to us. If you have pulled The Sun, you may feel as unguarded and gleeful as the child depicted in this card.
This card suggests that the sun has come out after a difficult time, such as illness. The sun's illumination clears up confusion, restores us to health, and dispels danger and resentment. You are now able to enjoy visibility. This is a time of success, recognition, and love. You may enjoy awards, prosperity, a joyful marriage, children, or grandchildren. A symbol of consciousness, The Sun shows you acting with confidence, conviction, and awareness.
Perhaps most important, The Sun indicates that you are easily able to give and receive compassion. The way we instinctually love and help a child, who unquestioningly receives our support, compassion is a reflex for you. Gratitude is foundational for you. You have the resources, successes, and support you need, and you are therefore able to extend your compassion and clarity to those who could use some more love.
### Mystic Meanings
In numerology, the number 19 represents attainment and clarity triumphing over uncertainty. When the digits are added together, the number 19 reduces to 10, the number of beginnings (in this case, children) and endings (the joyful success being celebrated). Then 10 reduces to 1, the number of unity, beginnings, and power.
The Sun's element is fire, emphasizing its energy, vitality, warmth, and power to illuminate.
The Sun's astrological association is the sun itself. The sun gives us health, clarity, and energy. It suggests that The Sun's qualities-joy, compassion, health, and success-are neither optional nor rare, but rather come up daily and regularly enjoy their season to shine. Pay attention to the simple, fundamental joys in your life. They are as real and important as anything else.
### Posing a Questions
My brother invited me to visit him overseas, and I'm uncertain of our current relationship dynamics. What's the likely outcome if I accept?
When The Sun is pulled in answer to this question, it indicates that the foundation of your relationship with your brother is joy. If your brother has a child or children, they will further add joy to your life if you choose to visit. If you make the journey, the connection and fun you have on this trip will continue to light your days long after you return home.

The Judgement card signals that we have changed in some deep way. Archangel Gabriel's trumpet calls us to fully awaken to this change. By card 20 in the Fool's Journey of the Major Arcana, we have experienced nearly every major type of human experience. We are now able to accept a higher calling.
Even under judgment, the naked figures in this card do not feel vulnerable. They have no more secrets. They feel awe, amazement, and the energy of their own and each other's awakening.
If you have pulled Judgement, you are going through a rite of passage. This rite of passage readies you to progress to the final achievement of this go around of your Fool's Journey. A divine judgment call is being made upon your actions and growth.
Or perhaps you are being called upon to make a judgment call. Critical thinking is important at this time, but be careful of being overly critical. At its extreme, Judgement indicates an excessively critical mind-set that inhibits us from succeeding.
The Judgement card represents forgiveness, release, and the celebration of a new life as we rise to a higher calling.

In numerology, the number 20 represents unity and reconciling of conflicts or challenges. This reduces to 2, the number of balance and choice. The ill-informed choices we have made throughout our Fool's Journey are, we hope, now balanced by the growth we've achieved. If not, a divine judge is balancing things for us, throwing us one last task to overcome in order to solidify and integrate the lessons we initially set out to learn. Judgement's element is fire, which burns up impurities. Judgement's astrological association is Pluto, the planet of soul-deep transformation.
### Posing a Question
I don't think the project I've been working on is going anywhere. What would be the consequences of starting over?
If you have pulled Judgement in answer to this question, you are likely nearing the end of your project, and your desire to quit is actually a desire to avoid judgment-both from the outside world about the quality of your work, as well as a reluctance to face what you need to face to get through to the end of your project.
The Judgement card suggests that even if you change projects, you will still have to face whatever it is that has been staring you down in the final stages of the current project. You're at a time in your life when it is especially important to face yourself and the quality of your contributions to the world.
Likely, the thing that feels incorrect or missing in your project is an ingredient that is also missing in your life. What you discover by either finishing this project or starting it anew will be just the wake-up call you have been waiting for.

The Lovers emphasize Judgement's meaning of a higher calling. Temperance and The Star reinforce Judgement's qualities of release, renewal, and cleansing.

Saturn assures us that a success like the one indicated by The World has been no small feat in the making and that our growth and success are solid and sure.

The World is a card of completion and celebration. Rather than focusing on giving your daughter all the advice you can for her years ahead, take the time to look back with her over her life, how much she has grown, and who she has become. Celebrating her growth and her completion of high school will allow her to enter college with the assurance and confidence she needs to make her own decisions with self-respect and joy. Pulling The World in response to any question about any change or transition suggests that the life change is due to growth, and the transition is in many ways a situation coming full circle.

Often, this card denotes retirement, but it can be any situation in which you have enough prosperity and time to create your own schedule and enjoy leisure, and enough experience and self-knowledge to know what you need, how you want to spend your time, and how to live in accordance with your values. You are intelligent and successful, and you have the luxury of enjoying the fruits of your accomplishments, particularly through lifestyle and through improving, beautifying, or enjoying the comforts of your home.
The Nine of Pentacles suggest that you are able to enjoy time to yourself. This might follow a period-or lifetime-of hard work, such as the Eight of Pentacles that precedes this card. You may also be focusing on enjoying the places and activities you already love, rather than exploring new options.
Be sure to be clear with yourself about why your alone time is important to you. Are you cultivating peace and contentment within yourself and enjoying a well-deserved rest, or are you actually generally distrustful of people and avoiding interaction-particularly with those outside of your social strata who could challenge your worldviews? The potential challenge of this card is loneliness.","### Reversed
Reversed, the Nine of Pentacles indicates that even though you live a life of relative luxury, you are lonely—maybe even depressed. You may have focused much of your life on your career and are now experiencing regret that you did not do more to cultivate your relationships. Remember that it is never too late to change the course of your life, fill your life with love, and develop meaningful relationships.",Nine of Pentacles,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,232,1445

In the Ten of Pentacles, we see three generations of a happy family with their two pet dogs. They are safe and comfortable in their large, secure home. In this card, resources have accumulated over the generations, but the Ten of Pentacles can also indicate a community rich in the combined spiritual or material resources or skillsets brought to it by its members.
The Ten of Pentacles indicates that you are giving or receiving support within your community or that you are joining a community-for example, through marriage into a new family, being accepted into an academic institution, or becoming part of any other multigenerational group.

The Page of Pentacles is an apprentice of some kind. They are learning a new skill, and they are awed and inspired by their task, as we can see in the expression of wonder on this Page's face. The Pages are young people or people who are young in spirit. The Page of Pentacles is young in their development of a particular skill, trade, or course of study. They are either receiving training to develop a talent or they are learning a trade.
The Page of Pentacles is diligent. So, deal in practicalities at this moment.

KEYWORDS Provider, Responsible, Constructing, Secure
After the Page of Pentacles gains some fluency in their trade or sphere of study, they graduate to become the Knight of Pentacles, a person with a strong sense of purpose in matters of work or responsibility, but who has yet to master their craft and become a Queen or King of Pentacles. This is a time of alternating success, trial and error. Overall, however, the long-term vision of the Knight of Pentacles is strong. The oak leaves adorning their helmet and the head of the horse remind us that just as the acorn holds the blueprint of the entire maple tree, the Knight of Pentacles is able to plant seeds of success with confidence and patience.
The Knight of Pentacles is building something. You or someone in your life is working industriously, either literally in a field like construction or property, or else in finance. If the Knight of Pentacles represents you, you are methodically improving your skills or knowledge, developing a project, finding or securing a home, or building your career or income.
As a person or a partner, the Knight of Pentacles promises to be a provider (they are a provider-in-the-making, as compared to the King of Pentacles, who has mastered money and material care). Their focus is on stability and security, and they plan everything out ahead of time. Be aware that this Knight's patience can lean toward inertia and stubbornness.","### Reversed
The reversed Knight of Pentacles emphasizes the negative polarity of this Knight upright: inertia and stubbornness. The reversed Knight of Pentacles is too cynical and cautious to motivate themself to do much of anything. They might also be miserly with their money.

They like to use their wealth to invest in experiences of beauty and to support others through charity or philanthropy. The Queen of Pentacles has a knack for channeling resources to make everyone involved feel grounded and supported.
The Queen of Pentacles indicates that you are financially comfortable, generous, and practically minded-or that you receive support from someone who has these qualities. If you are the Queen of Pentacles, you find practical, loving ways to care for those around you. You put attention into the details of your home, making it a sanctuary for those who visit. At an extreme, the Queen of Pentacles prizes orderliness over creativity or unconditional love.","### Reversed
Reversed, the Queen of Pentacles is no longer the benefactor, but the dependent. They might neglect or mismanage their resources, or even find themself in debt. Alternately, the reversed Queen of Pentacles can go overboard in fulfilling their role–caring for everyone but themself.

**ASTROLOGY** Aries, Taurus
**KEYWORDS** Provider, Established, Security
The King and Queen of Pentacles are similar in many ways. They both work with the land, money, or property, and they both are generous with their time and material resources. The main difference lies in the King's emphasis on security and using their resource management skills to provide and to keep everyone safe, while the Queen offers more support than protection. The Queen's actions are more personalized (they are gardeners), while the King's actions are more systematized (they often manage agriculture).
The King of Pentacles is an expert in managing resources, including money and time. This King channels their deftness at management into being a provider for their family.
While the King of Pentacles finds much meaning in their role of keeping their family secure and safe, an unbalanced King of Pentacles acts overly protective of their property, boundaries, and family.","### Reversed

The reversed King of Pentacles has lost sight of the purpose in managing resources so well. Instead of providing for their family and community, they set their morals aside in the pursuit of more wealth for themself. In their fixation on material gain and showiness, they may instigate corruption or gamble with unwise investments and actually go deep into debt.

# 8 THE MINOR ARCANA: SWORDS

SWORDS REPRESENT THE REALM OF MIND, thought, and the intellect. Both the sword and the mind are tools used for fighting for control. This suit represents incisive thought and critical-thinking skills, as well as actual conflicts with people in your life.

You may have been attacked, or have recently confronted painful truths. The pouring rain in this card shows that you are at least able to express this pain. Expression of the pain brings relief, catharsis, and the connection with loved ones that grief can offer.

In medieval Europe, it wasn't uncommon for a knight to have a coffin built for himself before he went to battle. If he came back alive, he would actually visit his own coffin and spend time lying in it. The purpose in doing this was to meditate on life, death, and the chances of fate. We see this pictured in the Four of Swords. Like the knight in the coffin, this card indicates that you are likely grappling with existential issues. The Four of Swords represents the need to recover from a wounding (such as the heartbreak of the previous card, the Three of Swords), accident, or illness. It is possible that you got hurt while fighting for your convictions or doing something you love. This is a time of rest and recovery. Try not to waste energy fighting your need to rest. Allow yourself time to heal.","### Reversed

Usually this card is interpreted to mean failure, such as losing a fight with a family member or struggling against an unfair boss or system-but the Five of Swords can also be interpreted to mean that you are the one doing the oppressing or being overly competitive.
In this card, the winner of the swordfight looks back smugly at the two people he has defeated. One person buries their head in their hands; the other walks away in dejection. The Five of Swords indicates spiteful winners and sore losers. Underlying the situation is a harsh dichotomy of failure and success that drives the losing party to succumb to dejection and the winner to gloat and be self-congratulatory.

This time of travel or moving on brings you out of a relatively narrow focus on the minutia of your life and offers you the perspective that only distance can bring. Your new perspective brings you peace and harmony. It also sparks reflection on what you value and the way you are living your life. This journey has a feeling of restfulness and spirituality.

They are ambitious, though sometimes can be superficial. The Page of Swords may refer to your own qualities or to the current influence in your life of a person with the qualities of the Page of Swords. Pages are beginners in learning the sphere of their suit.

ASTROLOGY Saturn in Leo
KEYWORDS Competition, Conflict, Chaos
After enjoying the stability and respite of the Four of Wands, it is time to mix things up a bit. Fives are dynamic; they throw a new element into the mix. The Five of Wands denotes a time that feels chaotic. You feel upset, confused, conflicted, fed up, or competitive.
The image in this card is deliberately unclear about whether the figures in the card are fighting, playing, building, or demolishing a structure. When many energies come together and start hashing it out, it is often impossible to understand the dynamics at first or predict the outcome. Therefore, this card can range from friendly competition and a needed dose of energy to outright fighting and unnecessary chaos or harm.
Often, this is a situation of healthy or constructive competition. Everyone in this competition likely stands a fair chance, so this can be an exciting time of testing and clarifying your intentions and plans. You might innovate or discover something about yourself that you otherwise would not have without this pressure and incentive. However, this card can also indicate infighting. Collaborators, family members, community members, or peers at school turn against each other, competing for a prize, status, or control.","### Reversed
Reversed, the Five of Wands can indicate that you are ignoring or suppressing a conflict rather than dealing with it, expressing a volatile truth, or letting the situation play out. Alternatively, the Five of Wands, reversed, can carry the opposite meaning, suggesting resolution, reconciliation, and cooperation. The reversed Five of Wands may also show you rising out of a chaotic situation in which many things are fighting for your attention by choosing your priorities.",Five of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,217,1348

**NUMBER 7** Spirituality, Tests
**ASTROLOGY** Mars in Leo
**KEYWORDS** Courage, Self-Defense, Forcefulness, Stubbornness
The Seven of Wands shows a figure standing on literal high ground, using one wand to defend themself against six attacking wands. In this fight-or-flight situation, the figure takes a strong stance and chooses to fight. This card signifies that you are defending or protecting yourself, your beliefs, and perhaps others against harassment or people who challenge your position.
The challenges are real, but they are absolutely surmountable as long as you don't let yourself get backed into a corner or wait too long to take action.
When the traits of this card become exaggerated, you can find yourself being overly defensive or sensitive to criticism. Ultimately, this card is about standing your ground. Whether out of stubbornness, fear, conviction in your beliefs, or a higher calling to protect something truly precious, you are protecting what matters to you.","### Reversed
Seven of Wands, reversed, suggests that you are feeling reluctant, insecure, or indecisive, and these feelings are keeping you from defending yourself. You are not defenseless. Take a deep breath, and step up to this challenge.",Seven of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,156,1005

NUMBER 8 Navigation, Prosperity, Authority
ASTROLOGY Mercury in Sagittarius
KEYWORDS Movement, Acceleration, Communication
Movement and acceleration characterize the Eight of Wands. A project launch, relationship, or search for love is gaining momentum and reaching an apex of its trajectory. You know what you want and where you are aiming to land. You are ready, willing, and able to do all the tasks necessary to achieve success in your endeavor.
A card of communication, the Eight of Wands can signify the many communications involved in achieving your goal or that a message is on its way to you. The movement represented in these eight flying wands can signify rapid changes or transitions, and the need to do many things at once in an effort to keep up. Things feel lively and possibly up in the air. You might feel impatient to find out how things will land. The transition can also be from one place to another: you might be traveling. Out of balance, the Eight of Wands indicates that you may be doing too many things at once-that there is little meaning in all this energy, and you feel needlessly frenetic and overstimulated.","### Reversed
When the Eight of Wands is reversed, it suggests that you are running yourself into the ground with your ceaseless activity. You are not accomplishing what you intend to accomplish, you are refusing to prioritize, or you are experiencing burnout. Slow down. Alternately, the reversal shows your reluctance to take on the liveliness of this card. You are dragging your feet, procrastinating, and moving more slowly than is appropriate for the situation.

NUMBER 9 Completion, Meditation, Achievement of Goals
ASTROLOGY Moon in Sagittarius
KEYWORDS Guarding, Protecting, Defending
Guarding one's boundaries is the theme of the Nine of Wands. The figure in this card is eager to protect themself and their achievements, despite already having been wounded in a fight, as we see from the bandage on their head. The Nine of Wands indicates that you truly believe you need to defend yourself from attack, despite your exhaustion from fighting and indications that you might be overreacting.
Compared to the Seven of Wands, in which you are driven by your ideals to defend yourself, the defensiveness of the Nine of Wands is almost defensiveness as a habit. This card does not show any oncoming attackers, but the figure nonetheless expects to be attacked. Ask yourself whether your vigilance serves a purpose right now. Are there challenges on the horizon that you need to be prepared for? If so, is defense, rather than resolution, the best way to prepare or is paranoia getting the best of you?
The Nine of Wands indicates that you or someone very present in your life right now is a tough, determined survivor who has fought their way to a strong position. This card pushes you to observe how you treat vulnerability in yourself and others, and encourages you to conserve your energy or take a gentler approach.","### Reversed

Reversed, the Nine of Wands signifies that you feel discouraged and exhausted from fighting. No matter how much you fight, the unreasonable or demanding person or people in your life have not backed down. You are on the verge of giving in. Check in with yourself about whether you are being overly defensive or if your need to defend yourself is real. Either way, change your tactic.",Nine of Wands,minor_arcana,both,card_meaning,233,1371

The Ten of Wands indicates that you are burdened with social, domestic, or career-related responsibilities. You have taken on a lot, perhaps too much. This card shows a figure who is more or less able to carry these responsibilities. Their back is bent under the weight of 10 wands, but they are strong enough to carry their burden at least a little further. The path ahead is clear, and the figure has almost made it home. You are almost to the finish line, but without being able to see where you are going, for all that you carry, you might literally lose sight of your destination. The burden of wands is at least gathered together tightly, suggesting unity of purpose and vision. This card signifies an ending, a final push. With strength, persistence, and as much prioritizing and foresight as possible, you will be able to persevere through this moment and enjoy relief and reward on the other side. If this card turns up in many of your readings, think about whether it is healthy for you to sustain so many burdens all the time and what you might be able to do to lighten the load.","### Reversed
