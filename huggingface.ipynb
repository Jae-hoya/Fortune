      "In a sunny a walled garden, we are back in what appears to be the earthly paradise of card VI, The Lovers—yet now we are reaching higher levels of consciousness and awakening. With the Sun, we are seeing the cosmic light. The child on his horse is ready to return home, uniting his spirit with the spirit of the world. He is open-armed and full of joy, and his nakedness shows him as a child of nature. Psychiatrist Carl Jung saw the archetype of the child as an aspect of our developing personality. In this way, the Sun holds echoes of our own childhoods, revealing an opportunity to recapture our early days—an idealized time of innocence and happiness, free for a time from adult, worldly anxieties. In this sense, the Sun is one of the happiest cards of the tarot, offering sanctuary, growth, success, and happiness.\n",

      ". Strength, card VIII, has a similar palette, again for vitality and also, acting with conscious awareness. Number four is the number of stability and balance. In the passionate suit of wands, it denotes security, shown by the protective walls of the castle, and celebration. In the kabbalistic Tree of Life (see page 234), the card links with Chesed, the sphere of love—which is why this card is often referred to as \"the honeymoon.\" Astrologically, the Four of Wands is linked to the planet Venus in the sign of Aries. This indicates passion, spontaneity, and joie de vivre. Aries, however, can be dominating at times, which can make love too intense or driven.\n",

From this point onward, we know the snake will tempt Eve to eat the fruit, and their relationship will change forever. In the major arcana sequence, the Lovers arrive after card V, The Hierophant. One of his meanings is marriage and the integration of male and female aspects. After the Lovers comes card VII, The Chariot—we have made our love decision, and the tension released drives us forward. The Lovers' number is VI, the number of harmony, love, and growth. It is also associated with healing and so links with the healing Archangel Raphael. The card's numerological link is XV, The Devil, who stands for the shadow side of love, when issues of control and possessiveness take hold.\n",

In this sense, the Sun is one of the happiest cards of the tarot, offering sanctuary, growth, success, and happiness.\n",

The star-shaped blooms may be white datura, or apple-thorn flowers, once used in herbal potions as an aphrodisiac or poison, but they also resemble a species of morning glory, which blooms early in the day—linking with a return to the early part of our lives, childhood and the past. Whichever flower we prefer, both carry the meaning of an otherworldly state of mind: Both apple thorn and morning glory were used as hallucinogens. Our hearts and minds are certainly not in the present moment.\n",

      "The Lovers' Hebrew letter is Zain, or sword—it can also connote the penis. As swords are the suit of Air in the tarot and symbolize clear thought and action, this relates to the card's meaning of decisions. The tarotist Jonathan Dee also comments, \"It is also interesting to note that Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden [of Eden] by an angel with a sword.\" Zain can also mean soulfulness or living with an awareness of our higher selves. The Lovers is placed on the seventh pathway on the Tree of Life between the spheres of Tiphareth, for beauty, rebirth, and ascending consciousness, and Binah, for understanding, the goddess, and the female principle.\n"

Water lilies flourish on the lake\\'s surface. There\\'s also a bird, a white dove of peace, descending toward the chalice. In its beak is a wafer marked with the sign of the cross, for the Host, or Eucharist. This may symbolize Christ, or the spark of the Divine, the life force, entering the chalice or womb, for fertility at a physical, creative, or spiritual level, reflecting the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere of Kether, for divine light. The bird, much like the folkloric stork bringing a baby in its beak, is about to deliver a gift. The chalice is offered with the right hand, the hand of giving (as opposed to the left hand, which traditionally is the receiving hand).\\n\\nTwenty-six dewdrops appear to emanate around the top of the cup stem, which could be a representation of semen. They are similar in form to the droplets on the Aces of Swords and Wands; XVI, The Tower; and XVIII, The Moon (see pages 176, 204, 94, and 102). While the Rider-Waite tarot\\'s originator, A. E. Waite, gives no specific meaning for the twenty-six droplets, this number may relate to the tetragrammaton of Y, H, V, H, the name of God in Hebrew, which is formed of the numeric values of the letters Yod, Hei, Vau, and Hei, adding up to twenty-six.\\n\\nThe Aces offer the pure energy of their suits. As number ones, they represent oneness with the divine spirit or God. Indivisible, their energy is singular, strong, and purposeful. They all represent beginnings, impulses, and new possibilities, in the most pure and obvious form.\\n\\nAstrologically, this card is linked with the element of Water, which stands for the emotions and life—hence the Ace of Cups\\' association with pregnancy. The W on the cup appears like an upside-down M—and if so may stand for mother, or the Hebrew letter, Mem, whose associated symbol is water, for the emotions, reminding us of the traditionally feminine element of the suit of Cups.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Ace of Cups brings the gift of love and key emotional events: fertility, pregnancy, birth, and motherhood; when not predicting a pregnancy, it can reveal that being a parent and/or partner takes priority over work, finances, and projects. In relationships, the card denotes falling in love, passion, and a significant new partnership. In existing relationships, it signifies loves and support. Positive emotions flow.\\n\\nIf you are nurturing a new project, this Ace heralds creativity and growth, so make time for activities you enjoy, and you will see them flourish. An enterprise you hold dear will come to fruition, so it\\'s time to turn to your novel, business concept, or travel plan and give it your full attention. This is also a great card for spiritual growth, so you may find yourself discovering a belief system or other important way to explore your spirituality.\\n\\nGenerally, this is a time for love, kindness, conviviality, and good friends, the simple joy in living each day and appreciating every moment.\\n\\nIn a reading, one Ace brings a focus on the life area according to the suit, which can set the theme of the reading. If two or more Aces appear near each other in a reading, it means the following:\\n\\n* Two Aces: An important partnership\\n* Three Aces: Good news\\n* Four Aces: Excitement, beginnings, and potential\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nAs you might expect from the meaning of the upright card, when reversed, the Ace suggests fertility issues and creative block. There may be lack of space and time to nurture your relationships and projects, or you may be the one feeling neglected; conversely, you may be feeling exhausted due to others\\' emotional demands. If you are asking about a new relationship, sadly, the reversed One can indicate disappointment and confusion—a potential new love does not develop into something more lasting.\\n\\nIn general, the reversed card reveals insecurity and doubt, and you may not feel you can believe in those people you\\'d like to trust. Follow your instincts and hold on to your self-belief; thankfully, this influence will not last.\\n\\n# TWO OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Water\\nAstrological Association: Venus in Cancer\\nNumber: 2\\nTree of Life Position: Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom\\nKey Meanings: Love and partnerships old and new\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE TWO OF CUPS\\n\\nA man and a woman face each other, eye to eye, each offering the other a cup. Between them is a strange symbol: the caduceus of Hermes and a lion\\'s head. The caduceus is a central rod entwined by two snakes, an ancient symbol of negotiation and balance associated with the winged Greek messenger-god, Hermes, the Roman Mercury. The lion, although not given a specific meaning by the card\\'s creator, A. E. Waite, can be interpreted as a symbol of passion and protection. The maiden is dressed in the colors of the High Priestess (see page 38)—blue and white—while the young man wears a tunic and boots similar to those of the Fool, card 0; even the colors of his tunic—yellow, red, and black—are similar to those of the Fool. The combination of the Fool\\'s meaning of beginnings and risk along with the virginal High Priestess\\'s intuition reveals that a brand-new relationship may be in the cards. The maiden is crowned with an olive garland, while our Fool sports a garland of red flowers; together, the garlands signify success and love. Their cups tell us that they are showing their emotions, and the man\\'s hand is reaching out toward the woman\\'s cup—a signifier of sexual intention, as cups are traditionally a womb symbol, just as the wand is phallic. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom, the father, and male virility. Astrologically, this card is linked with Venus in Cancer, a pairing that promotes intuition, love, and emotional support. There\\'s also a sense of domestic bliss here, shown by the idyllic cottage and green fields behind the couple. The number of the card, two, is for two people: relationships and other significant partnerships.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Two of Cups represents harmony, peace, partnership, and love. In relationships, the card signifies a deeper commitment in an existing relationship, such as an engagement, moving in together, or getting married (particularly when it appears with the \"marriage\" cards, V, The Hierophant, and the Ten of Pentacles). There\\'s a great connection between you two, so your emotions are freely expressed and reciprocated; you feel whole and content. The Two of Cups also predicts new romance and strong passions, which may be all-consuming just now. Inspiring partnerships are favored too, so this is an auspicious card for getting together with a study partner or anyone with whom you share similar creative interests, such as writing, crafting, and other hobbies, or psychic and healing work. Whomever you hook up with, the relationship will be mutually supportive and understanding. If friendships have been difficult territory for you recently, the Two of Cups shows harmony will return, and in general, this Two shows reconciliation. Old arguments will be resolved as you put the past behind you. Any ongoing negotiations will go in your favor, too—contracts, financial settlements, custody issues, or rearranging your working hours or schedule, for example.\\n\\nIf the Two represents you in your reading, the focus is on feelings and your intuition. Nurture all your relationships and enjoy the love and pleasure they bring. As a prediction card, it shows love: Deeper love is coming—and you deserve all that is on offer.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Two reveals relationship stress. A new romance may turn sour as your hopes for love are disappointed. Also, the card asks you to rely on your intuition; there may be a secret you don\\'t yet know, and traditionally, the reversed Two can show infidelity. Although on the surface everything may appear to be ticking along, pay attention to your instincts; there\\'s a reason for doubt, and it\\'s time to communicate openly about any fears rather than ignore them.\\n\\nGenerally, in established relationships, the Two can also indicate an unavoidable glitch simply due to the ongoing stresses and strains of leading too-busy lives. If it seems like this is the case, try to keep communicating—there may be a lack of understanding between you just now, but with work on both sides, you can rekindle your connection. Passion may be on hold just now, but it can return.\\n\\n# THREE OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Water\\nAstrological Association: Mercury in Cancer\\nNumber: 3\\nTree of Life Position: Binah, the sphere of understanding\\nKey Meaning: Celebration, abundance, family, and friendships\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE THREE OF CUPS\\n\\nThree maidens are raising their cups in a joint toast. They are so close together they almost appear as one, and in this way perhaps represent the three aspects of the goddess: maiden, mother, and crone—the whole experience of life. They can also be seen as three of the tarot virtue cards, denoted by the colors of their robes. The woman in white is the maiden from VIII, Strength; the woman in red, with her back to us, is crimson-robed Justice, from card XI; and the woman in red and white links with the colors of Temperance\\'s angel Gabriel. So Strength, Justice, and Temperance together give us parts of this card\\'s meaning: vitality, balance, and reunion. The feminine aspect of the card is also expressed in the Tree of Life sphere Binah, which means understanding and represents the feminine principle.\\n\\nThe maidens are barefoot and free, their robes flowing, and together they appear to be dancing. Fully engaged with life, two women raise their cups with their right hands and the other toasts with her left hand. The right hand is the hand of giving and the left hand receives, so their poses shows they are able to both give and receive abundantly. The Three of Cups is also a card of earthly pleasures, symbolized by the garden of flowers and plentiful ripe fruits. Astrologically, the card is linked with Mercury in Cancer, which promotes sociability, fun, and going with the flow. The negative aspect of this conjunction is thoughtlessness and superficiality. So happy are these women in paradise that little else exists for them, but, quite rightly, they will enjoy their moment of happiness and success while they can.\\n\\nThe number three is dynamic—it is the number of creation. As the next card in the suit after the Two of Cups, for partnerships, the Three of Cups is naturally the next step as two people create three with a new baby or, symbolically, with the birth of a creative project. Three is also the number of the Empress, the goddess-mother archetype in the major arcana (see page 42).\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nIt\\'s time to celebrate! The Three shows parties and reunions—from anniversaries, christenings, weddings, and birthdays to a great night out or weekend away with friends and family. This is a time for indulgence and reward, to enjoy other\\'s company, be carefree, and have simple fun. There\\'s also a flirtatious air about this Three, so if you\\'re looking for a relationship, you\\'ll soon be in the perfect situation and mood for lighthearted love.\\n\\nThe cups on the card are raised in a toast: There\\'s a feeling of abundance, but if you\\'re a wine-rather than water-drinker, or you\\'ve got a sweet tooth, you may be tempted to overindulge. However, whatever your pleasure, the Three ultimately reveals emotional and/or physical healing. Spending time with people who make you feel good raises your vibration and energy levels. This positive influence can also soothe physical ailments that are triggered or exacerbated by stress.\\n\\nAs three is the number of creation, this shows a creative time—literally, with a pregnancy or birth, or in your creative goals. Turn your focus to new ideas and share them, as whatever you do will be enjoyable and well received, and even rewarded, by others. It\\'s time to let your talent shine.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Three of Cups can indicate a flirtation or indulgence gone too far, with affairs and heated emotions. In established relationships, there may be distance and a lack of cohesion and understanding. Someone close may be overly opinionated and egotistical, and the dynamics of a close relationship—romantic or friendship—become skewed. Emotional betrayal in friendships is also a common meaning of the Three of Cups.\\n\\nCreativity takes a nosedive, too, as creative blocks abound; it may be hard to get started as you suffer a lack of motivation and support. If so, take a break and return to your projects when you feel more grounded and less affected by others\\' emotional demands.\\n\\nThis card can also show irritating or recurrent health problems that need your attention.\\n\\n# FOUR OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Water\\nAstrological Association: Moon in Cancer\\nNumber: 4\\nTree of Life Position: Chesed, the sphere of love\\nKey Meanings: Restlessness and boredom\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE FOUR OF CUPS\\n\\nA young man sits under a tree, his arms and legs crossed. Three cups are set out in a row before him. From a cloud, a hand holds out a fourth cup, resembling the one on the Ace of Cups, symbolizing a new start. Although the hand appears at his eye level, his eyes are downcast—he is refusing to acknowledge the offered cup. Disenchanted, he appears to be looking discontentedly at the three cups on the grass as if to indicate that the fourth cup, whatever it may represent, is bound to be just more of the same old thing. This is in sharp contrast to the Three of Cups, in which the cups are held aloft in celebration (see page 124). The young man\\'s pose is defensive, and he has set himself apart from his own emotions and the possibility of change.\\n\\nRegardless of his mood, the sky is blue and the outlook is bright. The tree that gives him refuge is in full leaf. If he were to stand up and move around, he could enjoy the abundant life going on all around him. In this way, the card shows the potential for others to see your light, to see you able to stand tall like a tree, rooted and firm, and with branches open to embrace whatever comes. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the individual sphere associated with this card is Chesed, for love. In the case of this Four, it shows that love and support are there, if one wants it.\\n\\nAstrologically, this card is linked with the Moon in Cancer, which denotes sensitivity and deep intuition, which we see in the self-protective pose of the man, with his arms and legs crossed. The negative aspect of this conjunction is possessiveness and sentimentality—not wanting to let go of what we have, regardless of whether it makes us happy or not.\\n\\nThe number four is the number of stability, which in Cups, the suit of emotions, indicates inertia. Water needs to flow—if it rests too long, it stagnates. In this way, the Four of Cups shows an underlying restlessness, a feeling that something is not quite right, but habit keeps the young man from making a decision.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nIf you are looking for a relationship, the Four of Cups shows disillusion. This card often comes up if you have been hurt in the past and protect yourself with a checklist, instantly rejecting anyone who doesn\\'t live up to your exacting standards—to the degree that even if your soul mate came along right now, you wouldn\\'t recognize his or her potential. I call this the \"Will I ever meet anyone I like?\" card. The answer is: You can and will, but it\\'s time to risk opening up emotionally again. You may think you\\'re ready for love, but there may be some past issues still to heal. If you\\'re in an established relationship, the Four of Cups shows a tinge of boredom. This may be a phase, and if so, it\\'s time to inject some romance; otherwise, you may find yourself staying in a relationship out of habit.\\n\\nIn work and home life, the card shows a static situation—you may feel bored with your job or need to make a positive change to your environment. Even a small change will go a long way to making you feel you are going forward, so look around for some much-needed inspiration—it isn\\'t far away.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe meaning of the reversed Four of Cups is generally the same as for the upright card, but with a higher degree of dissatisfaction—you may be yearning for change but don\\'t yet know what you want. If so, it\\'s important to try new tactics at work and address what needs to change in your relationship or environment. Try to express your needs now, rather than locking them up.\\n\\nWhen the Four of Cups is reversed, the man\\'s crossed legs echo the bent knee of card XII, The Hanged Man. One of this major arcana card\\'s meanings is hanging around, feeling in limbo. Rather than wait for change, the message of the reversed Four of Cups is to take control and make life happen. Thankfully, this limbo is temporary—change is always possible.\\n\\n# FIVE OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Water\\nAstrological Association: Mars in Scorpio\\nNumber: 5\\nTree of Life Position: Geburah, the sphere of power\\nKey Meanings: Loss, leaving, and sorrow\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE OF CUPS\\n\\nA figure shrouded in black, for mourning, contemplates three overturned cups. These are the three standing cups from the Four of Cups, the previous card, which have been cast to the ground, spilling blood or wine and water. A small dwelling is set above a river, which flows under a bridge with two arches. This may be a home that he has left behind, a symbol of past happiness and security he is now separated from by water, evoking the mythical Styx that divided the world of the living from the otherworld of the dead. The river also suggests the saying \"a river of tears,\" in keeping with the sorrowful feel of the card. The mourner is in unfamiliar territory, a place of sadness, away from comfort and emotional security—at least for the time being. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Geburah, which means power, destruction, and cruelty. The mourner is powerless in his loss, which may or may not be cruel; yet what he doesn\\'t appear to notice are the two vessels behind him, still standing. Three cups are overturned, but there are two that he can grasp—all he needs to do is to turn around and see them. While he cannot change past events, it is up to him to make the best of what remains.\\n\\nAstrologically, this card is linked with Mars in Scorpio, bringing warlike qualities to the passionate sign of Scorpio, also linked with death and the past. The mourner is engrossed with the spilled cups, and it\\'s worth noting that in the original Rider-Waite deck of 1910, his face was strangely red, the same color as the spilled wine or blood. While this may just be the artist using the same blood red for consistency, the blush indicates shame—shame and embarrassment about past actions or humiliation caused by a person or situation.\\n\\nThe number five in the tarot\\'s minor arcana usually indicates imbalance and upset. After the stable, if boring, four, five brings disruption—but this is often necessary and can be the only way to shift energy and bring about healing and change. Five is also the number of humanity. The sadness of this card is universal, shared by all of us at some point in our lives.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Five of Cups is the card of upset and loss. It often shows sadness and confusion due to a breakup, disappointment or arguments in a close friendship, or the need to temporarily move away from a family member who has caused hurt. The card can also apply to leaving a job or home before you are ready to do so—you are forced to deal with whatever life throws your way, whether invited or not. This card can also refer to a loss of status or money. The gift of this five is that there is no mistaking what has happened because you feel it in every bone of your body. At this point, there is no going back. But all is not lost: You will be able to move onward and upward regardless. The two remaining cups on the card can show the support of friends, family, and colleagues. The Five of Cups can also come up in a reading for a bereavement and the natural sense of loss and grief this brings. It\\'s also an indicator that you or the person you are reading for is revisiting the past, trying to assimilate old stress and sorrow in order to make a fresh start.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe Five of Cups along with major arcana card XV, The Devil, are the only two cards in the tarot deck whose reversed interpretations are more positive than their upright meanings. The Five reversed reveals you have already experienced the lowest point in a downward cycle and, as a result, are close to recovery, finally letting go of painful past memories. Ready to pick up the pieces, you will be stronger than you were before, able to face reality and move forward. An additional meaning of the card is meeting up with old friends and, socially speaking, coming back to life.\\n\\n# SIX OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Water\\nAstrological Association: Sun in Scorpio\\nNumber: 6\\nTree of Life Position: Tiphareth, the sphere of beauty and rebirth\\nKey Meanings: Harmony, childhood, reconciliation, and old friends\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE SIX OF CUPS\\n\\nThe two figures on this card look odd—an overgrown child in a red cap offering a cup to a girl dressed liked an old woman in the garden of a manor house and tower. One cup stands on a stone podium with a heraldic shield, while four cups stand upright before them. There\\'s a fairytale theme at work here, which reminds us of childhood tales: little red cap, or little red riding hood, or even a child-prince awakening a princess grown old after one hundred years of sleep. However we interpret this otherworldly scene, it is designed to remind us of childhood and the past.\\n\\nThe tower and watchman on the left of the card symbolize protection and the flowers, spiritual blossoming and love. The star-shaped blooms may be white datura, or apple-thorn flowers, once used in herbal potions as an aphrodisiac or poison, but they also resemble a species of morning glory, which blooms early in the day—linking with a return to the early part of our lives, childhood and the past. Whichever flower we prefer, both carry the meaning of an otherworldly state of mind: Both apple thorn and morning glory were used as hallucinogens. Our hearts and minds are certainly not in the present moment.\\n\\nIn astrology, the Six of Cups is linked with the Sun in Scorpio, which stands for loyalty and strong bonds with friends, family, and partners. Scorpio is a sign of deep emotions and the past, again suggesting the impact of childhood experience. The Six of Cups\\' Tree of Life sphere is Tiphareth, for beauty and rebirth, which emphasizes the card\\'s meaning of reconnection with people from the past.\\n\\nThe number six stands for serenity and peace. The six-pointed Star of David is composed of two triangles, representing the concept of heaven on earth—a reminder that we can realize the heavenly and spiritual aspects of ourselves in our daily lives to enjoy harmony in mind, body, and spirit. In the Six of Cups, the two themes are the past and the present. The challenge is to integrate our experiences, reconciling our past memories with present reality to create the future—the perfection of this idea is summed up in the Ten of Cups, the card of family and full emotional expression. The diagonal cross, known as the saltire cross, on the podium in the Six of Cups\\' garden makes the shape of the roman number X, or 10—again, offering an ideal concept of love on earth.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Six of Cups reveals happy memories and a time to recall childhood with fondness. Your children, if you have them, may help you reconnect with your own childhood, or you are able to give your inner child free rein to play and have fun without the usual burden of worries. This is a time for good things coming from the past—reunion parties, reconnecting with old friends and more distant family members, or literally going back to your roots. This card may predict a trip home or to a place with fond memories. In some way, the past returns to help you in the present, too, as conversations and reminiscing with old friends or contacts seeds a new idea or approach.\\n\\nOverall, you will find the right balance in relationships and enjoy a period of peace and harmony. This Six of Cups also shows compassion and kindness, so if you have suffered poor treatment, your situation is set to improve. Sweet, happy times are ahead, and any disruptions or upsets will be soothed and remedied. In love, an old flame comes back, and you may need to weigh up if it is worth going back to the relationship.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Six of Cups is reversed, nostalgia rules, and you may recall past events with more positivity than they deserve. The card can also show you feeling locked in the past as a way to avoid moving on. A particular relationship needs to stay in the past rather than be revived. Unexpected visitors or communications may stir up old memories, and if so, let the memories rest—these people have no place in your future just now.\\n\\n# SEVEN OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Water\\nAstrological Association: Venus in Scorpio\\nNumber: 7\\nTree of Life Position: Netzach, the sphere of endurance, instinct, and desire\\nKey Meanings: Opportunities and extremes\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE SEVEN OF CUPS\\n\\nSeven cups appear to float in the sky, and a dark, anonymous figure seems to behold or even command them. Each cup has its own mini-cloud, rather like the Ace of Cups itself. And like the Ace multiplied, this card offers us seven potential gifts or beginnings—but it is up to us to discern what is feasible. At the moment, we\\'re like the foreground figure: in the shadows, trying to discern reality from fantasy.\\n\\nEach cup has an emergent symbol. The first cup shows a male face with curly hair, which echoes that of Archangel Michael, the angel of Temperance, card XIV, indicating a higher force may be at work. It can also be seen as your own reflection, a sign of your future potential. The tiny covered figure in the central cup symbolizes what is hidden and can be regarded as a symbol of Christ and ascending consciousness—the shadow figure, perhaps, is sensing a divine plan yet to be revealed.\\n\\nThe snake in the third cup stands for wisdom and flattery. (The snake also appears on card VI, The Lovers, and X, The Wheel of Fortune.) The tower on the rock appears to be a fantasy castle—as A. E. Waite says, \"the images are most especially those of the fantastic spirit.\" The fifth cup shows overflowing jewels, for riches and abundance. The sixth cup shows a victory wreath like that on the Six of Wands, but on the cup itself is a shadowy likeness of a skull, casting doubt on this positive meaning—even this wreath-cup, the most obvious of symbols, is not what it seems. The wreath can mean fame, or reputation, which triumphs over death, just as in the procession of triumphs in the major arcana sequence (see page 11). The seventh cup shows a salamander or dragon with a forked tongue. Who knows if what we hear are lies or truth?\\n\\nAll in all, the this card\\'s seven images, according to Waite, are those of \"reflection, sentiment, imagination, things seen in the glass of contemplation.\" They are not real—yet.\\n\\nIn astrology, the Seven of Cups is linked with Venus in Scorpio, which stands for mad passions and extreme reactions. This meaning links with the interpretation for the reversed card, which can indicate obsessive thinking. Netzach, the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, means endurance and desire—in this card, we might interpret this as ongoing fantasy.\\n\\nThe number seven is a mystical number. It was sacred to the god Apollo, founder of the famous Delphic oracle, and is the number of the days of the week, the deadly sins, and the wonders of the world (see The Chariot, page 58). Seven represents possibilities: It comprises three, the number of heaven, and four, the number\\tof\\tearth—and\\tso\\tthe\\tpotential\\tto\\tbring\\theaven\\tdown\\tto\\tearth,\\tto\\tmanifest an\\tideal.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nChoices and confusion—While the seven brings the potential for amazing opportunities, these options and offers are insubstantial. At present, it\\'s not clear what\\'s feasible and what is fantasy, as everything feels up in the air, just like the floating cups on the card itself. Be discerning and find out what you can about each possible path, but ultimately you\\'ll need to choose by paying attention to your instincts and emotions. This is not a test of logic: Go with the flow and trust your inner knowing. Don\\'t rush. In relationships, the card can show new doorways opening again as joint finances improve. The Seven is also the card of the visionary and shows the beginning stages of a new project, when anything is possible. Dreams and visions are additional interpretations.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe reversed Seven of Cups has much the same meaning as the upright card, but here, extreme emotions are in play. Be aware of the danger of idealizing a situation and avoiding a difficult truth; in relationships, the card can mean being deceived by appearances—a new lover may not be faithful. This is not the right time for commitment. Avoid becoming embroiled in drama; step back until your options are clear.\\n\\n# EIGHT OF CUPS\\n\\n**Element:** Water\\n**Astrological Association:** Saturn in Pisces\\n**Number:** 8\\n**Tree of Life Position:** Hod, the sphere of majesty and the mind\\n**Key Meanings:** Departure, change, and emotional intelligence\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE EIGHT OF CUPS\\n\\nLike card XVIII, The Moon, we see the sun and moon combined. Which will reign—the sun (the mind) or the moon (impulse and intuition)? This is nighttime, the moon\\'s realm: Our hero turns away from his familiar surroundings under her light, guided by his instincts alone. The sun will have his time the next day, when it\\'s time for plans and practicalities, but for now, he must go with the flow, following the water toward a new destination.\\n\\nThe cloaked man has found a way forward. He has navigated a ribbon of pathway by the low rocks, which gives way to a soft riverbank, where he walks purposefully, supported by his staff. This can be likened to the Magician\\'s wand or the Hermit\\'s staff, a symbol of internal guidance. His red cloak shows he has the ability to manifest his intentions. We also sense he left his cups just moments ago—the gap in the top line of three cups still puts him among them, as if he has only just said good-bye. With his back to us, he is firmly fixed on the mountain to the right, a symbol of challenges and new, great experiences to come. When he has journeyed around the mountain, we know that our hero will have an entirely different perspective.\\n\\nThis Eight of Cups\\' astrological association is Saturn in the sign of Pisces. Saturn, the task-master planet, in imaginative Pisces poses a potential conflict between practical needs and idealism. Perhaps the solution is found in the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Hod. Its common meaning is majesty, and in this card, it refers to the mastery of the mind—finding solutions and direction.\\n\\nEight is the number of fulfilment. It comprises two fours, the number of stability, which, however, when interpreted in the suit of Cups, turns to dissatisfaction and boredom. The Eight of Cups therefore is boredom doubled—or at the very least, a situation that has become stagnant. Conversation, creativity, or money no longer flows, so it must be found elsewhere.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright Eight of Cups reveals a time of restlessness when it feels as if something is missing. Work and relationships may appear harmonious from the outside, but your intuition is nagging you. The result may be a departure. Traditionally, the Eight of Cups predicts you leave a situation or break an agreement that no longer gives you fulfilment. This should not be a hasty decision; only move on when you are sure that there is no more you can gain or contribute. When the timing is right, there\\'s also less drama than you would expect: Like the figure on the card slipping away in the night, you can take your leave quietly and swiftly. Naturally, you may feel sadness but little regret—provided the timing is right.\\n\\nLike the figure in red following the path of the river, it\\'s now time to go with the flow. You\\'ll soon feel energized to move on to where your interests and curiosity call. You can also feel content with what you have achieved.\\n\\nThis card often turns up in a reading to show that you have already left a situation emotionally, and action will follow as you now take your actual leave. It can also predict a time to travel, to explore physically or through spiritual journeying.\\n\\n## REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhat are you holding on to? Take stock: Are you clinging in to the past when you really do know that your current living situation has to change? When reversed, the Eight of Cups shows errors of judgment, so you jump too soon or stay too long, unable to see that there\\'s an alternative way to do things. At this point, there\\'s no logical solution; like the Eight of Cups\\' sphere of Hod, for the mind and its strategies, an intellectual approach might make you feel in control, but the way ahead is to follow your instincts. Timing is important now, so trust yourself that you will know the right time to move on, without self-pressure. An additional meaning of the card is being abandoned, leaving you confused as others move on from you—with undignified haste.\\n\\n# NINE OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Water\\nAstrological Association: Jupiter in Pisces\\nNumber: 9\\nTree of Life Position: Yesod, the sphere of foundation and the unconscious mind\\nKey Meaning: Happiness\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE NINE OF CUPS\\n\\nA seated male figure is encircled by nine cups on a table. Radiant with pride, he shows off what he has in life: joy and achievement. The cups are trophies, rewards for his past efforts, on display for all to see. This is a card of true happiness; what the man possesses can be enjoyed to the full. As the table is covered with a cloth, there is also a sense of banqueting, the table set ready to welcome a party. Secure in his role as benefactor, it is the man\\'s joy to share his riches with others. He is perfectly comfortable with this abundance, sitting squarely on a low bench wearing a cap and hose—both red for vitality and joie de vivre.\\n\\nWith lucky planet Jupiter in the idealistic sign of Pisces, astrologically the Nine of Cups has the meaning of good fortune, prosperity, fun, and the spirit of generosity. Piscean\\'s natural humanitarianism comes to the fore, as what benefits our hero of the Nine of Cups will naturally be shared with others. The card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Yesod, means foundation. Ruled by the Moon, symbol of the unconscious, Yesod brings together intuition and logic in balance—an alignment with our life purpose.\\n\\nAs a nine of the suit of Cups, this card indicates emotions find their ultimate expression: Feelings flow. Nine also represents the triad of mind, body, and spirit, showing a perfect balance of all three aspects of our humanity. In this way, the Nine of Cups symbolizes joy that is perfectly expressed. The cups almost touch one another in a half circle symbolizing intimacy and connection.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Nine of Cups is known as the wish card of the tarot because it foretells a dream come true. Whatever you hope for can now come to fruition. Joy comes from prosperity, generosity, and optimism, alongside parties and entertainment.\\n\\nIn relationships, the Nine of Cups reveals new romance and rewarding friendships. Whatever feelings have been nurtured in the past can now be expressed as others show their hearts. The time for waiting for love is over; if love has grown, it will be declared fully. Friends will step closer to you as you feel more connected to your own heart. When fully living your truth, others respond. In the spirit of sharing, there is now an easy connection with others as projects begin and existing work becomes more rewarding. This is a time to communicate, laugh, and appreciate all you have.\\n\\nIf you are nurturing a new project or idea, the Nine of Cups heralds its growth,\\tso\\tlisten\\tto\\tyour\\tintuition,\\tmake\\ttime\\tfor\\tthe\\tactivities\\tthat\\tmake\\tyou happy,\\tand\\tsee\\tthem\\tflourish.\\tAstrologically,\\tthis\\tcard\\tis\\tlinked\\twith\\tJupiter\\tin Pisces,\\twhich\\tpromotes\\timagination,\\tartistic\\tflair,\\tand\\tgenerosity—so\\tit\\tis\\ttime, also,\\tto\\tshare\\tand\\town\\tyour\\tideas.\\tIndependence\\twill\\talso\\tbe\\timportant\\tat\\tthis time.

This can manifest as smugness. More commonly in readings, the Nine reversed tells a tale of narcissism: You are faced with others’ inability to see beyond their own immediate needs. This influence can infect personal and professional relationships, which suffer as others forge ahead with their agendas for short-term gain, leaving you bruised. However, it’s also worth asking yourself if you are the one overstriving for recognition, sidelining others in the process.\\n\\nIn personal and business projects, uncertainty rules due to misunderstandings, and your plans may be delayed. Creativity can suffer at this time, too, with stop-start-stop frustration. Focus on maintaining balance and routine to help you navigate these difficult waters and hold on to those dreams and schemes. This may not be the right time for new ideas idea to flourish, but this doesn’t diminish your worth or the strength of your concepts.\\n\\nTake extra care of yourself and your relationships now, as energy levels may be low; hibernate a little until that spark returns.\\n\\n# TEN OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Water\\nAstrological Association: Mars in Pisces\\nNumber: 10\\nTree of Life Position: Malkuth, the Kingdom, the sphere of experience\\nKey Meanings: Prosperity, joy, family, and contentment\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE TEN OF CUPS\\n\\nHere is an idealized family scene: mother, father, and their two children, who are dancing. We see their home, established above a river, and from the river plain below, the couple beholds ten glowing cups in the sky, arranged on a rainbow arc. The river flows, trees grow, and not one cloud can be seen. This family lives in abundance—shown also by their smart clothing—and they appear to be celebrating their achievement. This is their kingdom, their Malkuth, the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere. What could be happier than this place of security and contentment?\\n\\nThe focus here is on the ideal of perfection. This is the perfect life, blessed by a vision of the ten cups; the rainbow is a symbol of hope and reward. We see only the backs of the couple and, although the children are engrossed in their own game, they are happy entertaining themselves while their parents raise their arms in thanks for all they have been given.\\n\\nIn numerology, ten represents completeness and perfection. In the Ten of Cups, this gives the meaning of greatest happiness. Out of the ten cups, four are directly touching, perhaps reflecting the familial connection between the four figures.\\n\\nThe Ten of Cups\\' astrological association reveals that feeling, rather than intellect, is foremost: The warlike influence of Mars dissipates when in the sign of gentle, idealistic Pisces, so the focus is on intuition and the emotions.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nOne of the most positive cards of the minor arcana, the Ten of Cups reveals the benefits of love and the security of family; it favors children as an expression of love, and often reveals that children will do well socially and academically, succeeding in their studies. The card therefore predicts great happiness for couples and families or equivalent close friendship groups. In work, the Ten of Cups shows peace and harmony for business partnerships and other key networks. Togetherness, not competition, will be your strength. In fact, anything you do en masse will go well now, from sporting activities, committees, and choirs to group trips and collaborative projects.\\n\\nIn relationships, this is an emotional time, in wholly a positive way. Partnerships built on stability and trust become even more rewarding and supportive. Different generations of a family may come together and put aside old disagreements; it\\'s a common card for forthcoming weddings, parties, and other significant celebrations. Communication between parents and children, children and grandparents, and other family members will grow stronger and be more fulfilling. If you have been searching for a new home, the Ten of Cups shows this will come to you, and it will be the right property in the right location for your needs.\\n\\nIn relation to projects, the card gives assurance that what you have worked hard for will finally come together. Financially, the Ten of Cups is a wonderful indicator of prosperity, which comes to you as a result of well-deserved achievement.\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Ten of Cups retains much of its positive vibe, but with some irritating undercurrents and changes in friendships and family bonds. A family issue may need to be addressed as your routine is disrupted, or you sense discord in some relationships; also, you may feel that you\\'re not getting an entitlement, from respect from different generations of the family to enjoying enough time with children. Your plans to bring friends and family together may falter due to miscommunication. Equally, the need to keep up appearances prevents authentic conversations and understanding.\\n\\nFriends may also prove troublesome under the influence of the reversed Ten of Cups, and as a result, one or two confidants step back from your circle or introduce you to a new friend of theirs with whom you don\\'t feel comfortable—which upsets your usually happy dynamic. However, other people you prefer will soon come into your orbit to take their place.\\n\\nDo bear in mind, however, that these are temporary glitches, rather than major challenges—and that the reversed Ten of Cups\\' overriding meaning is still positive.\\n\\n# PAGE OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Earth of the suit of Water\\nKey Meaning: Love news\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE PAGE OF CUPS\\n\\nA fairytale page holds a cup, contemplating a fish within it—which appears to look up at him as if about to communicate. The fish is a symbol here of dreams and emotions that have taken form, so the Page is contemplating that which has come from the deep—or his desires and impulses. In folklore and Chinese myth, the fish is a prosperity symbol; in the ancient Celtic story of Fionn MacCumhail (pronounced Finn MacCool), the hero eats the salmon of knowledge and becomes the wisest person in all the land; and in Paganism, the fish has been a fertility symbol associated with female genitalia. A secret symbol of faith for persecuted Christians during Greek and Roman times, the fish is also a symbol of the soul. But the Page is not all deep symbolism—there\\'s playful magic and lightheartedness here, too—one of the key meanings of the card.\\n\\nThe Page stands on dry land, and behind him water flows; perhaps the fish has sprung from this river or ocean. The card\\'s element is Earth of Water, which suggests that emotions, thoughts, and ideas—the water—can become as substantial as earth, or matter. The Page\\'s tunic is decorated with water lilies, and as lilies are traditional signifiers of purity, this Page is pure of heart. His colors, blue and pink, stand for spirituality and love. The scarf around his hat flows down around his shoulders, echoing the flow of the water. From this, we can tell that his emotions are on show. One side of the scarf forms a scallop shape, another echo of the fish\\'s natural habitat.\\n\\nPages and Knights in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Page in a reading by working with the card\\'s imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As an influence:** The Page represents sociability, good company, and fun. Whatever your age, the Page reveals you will feel young at heart. As Pages are messengers, the Page of Cups brings good news about the emotional aspects of your life: relationships, children, and finances (when this has a direct impact on your relationships). In love, he can show a new potential partner is coming. This is not the Page himself—he is simply the messenger—but he lets you know that love is once more on the horizon. While it will be tempting to rush into a new romance, it may be wise to hold back a little. Other responsibilities such as extra work and exams can\\'t be abandoned just yet. This card also favors imagination and creativity, and so augers well for new projects and opportunities to improve your home and lifestyle. If you have suffered periods of insecurity and doubt, the Page assures you that all is well and good times are ahead. Finances are also favored now.\\n\\n**As a person:** An individual with an artistic temperament, this Page is a dreamer. He loves company, is highly emotional and intuitive, and is naturally generous, sometimes to a fault. He is a good friend and happy to introduce others into his circle. The Page can often indicate a sensitive child or other young person you care for.\\n\\n**As the \"you\" card in a reading:** It\\'s time to enjoy life\\'s pleasures.\\n\\n**As an influence:** If two or more Pages fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Pages: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed\\n* Three Pages: Lots of social activities\\n* Four Pages: A social group of young people\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Page brings frustration and irresponsibility. Offers do not materialize; you may feel that life is all work and no play. As a person, the reversed Page is emotionally immature and attention-seeking, so you cannot rely on his perspective—he can only obsess about his own needs. This person may be living in a dream world and become very defensive when challenged. In family relationships, a child may find it difficult to communicate his or her feelings.\\n\\nAn additional meaning of the reversed Page is intoxication—too much partying. It\\'s time to calm down and get back to an ordered routine.\\n\\n# KNIGHT OF CUPS\\n\\nElement: Fire of the suit of Water\\nAstrological Associations: Aquarius and Pisces\\nKey Meaning: A proposal\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE KNIGHT OF CUPS\\n\\nThis is a proud knight indeed. With his heroic helmet topped with the wings of Hermes, Greek god of communication, he sits astride a dainty steed. Shiny and poised, he is dressed more for appearance than warfare. As traditionally knights all have a quest, this Knight\\'s quest is love, signified by two elements on the card: his outstretched, empty cup, symbol of his quest for the holy grail of love; and the river flowing through the valley, which signifies that he will follow the course of his feelings. The blue of his armor links with the meaning of truth (shown also in card II, The High Priestess), while the red fish design on his tunic denotes passion, along with faith (see also the Page of Cups, page 140).\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Fire of the suit of Water. Together, this combination makes for conflicting feelings: Fire and Water cancel each other out, so the Knight veers between bravado and ultra-sensitivity. His words may be engaging, but he may hesitate when it comes to action—not the ideal quantities of a marital knight. In truth, we would rather have the cutting Knight of Swords or action-hero Knight of Wands to protect us and defend the realm. The Knight of Cups\\'s characteristics are more in keeping with the idealized knights of Chrétien de Troyes\\'s medieval tales, *Le Morte d\\'Arthur*—when courtship followed strict rituals. Love was an impossible ideal, and, often, an unattainable lady the object of obsession—a far cry from real, requited relationships in earthly life. Such is our Knight of Cups: full of potential, loud with declarations. But will his words of love translate into commitment?\\n\\nKnights and Pages in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Knight in a reading by working with the card\\'s imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As an influence:** The Knight of Cups heralds an emotional time—you may be bewitched by a new love interest (or even more than one), enjoy more romance with an existing partner, and/or other sweet things that capture your imagination: beauty, nature, time away from work or your usual routines, or creative pursuits. New friends may enter your circle.\\n\\n**As a person:** Idealistic and dreamy, artistic and sensitive, this Knight is a true romantic. His arrival in a reading shows a love prospect and even a proposal—which is wonderful if you have an established relationship. However, as a new love interest, tread carefully. This Knight is an idealist and, while wanting a relationship, finds it hard to articulate his true feelings. He may be stuck behind a persona of the perfect partner—gallant and generous—but unable to drop the act to let you see who he really is. While this is understandable in the early days of a romance, if the actions don\\'t match the words of passion, take care; don\\'t be swept away just yet.\\n\\nAs the \"you\" card in a reading: Be open to real love; judge not by appearance.\\n\\nAs an influence: If two or more Knights fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Knights: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed\\n* Three Knights: Men meeting up\\n* Four Knights: Lots of action; events speed up\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe Knight reversed means disappointment—an offer that at first glance appeared perfect does not materialize, leaving you feeling confused and pushed out. As a person, the reversed Knight is untrustworthy and unreliable. He is hooked on the chase, the romantic or sexual ideal, but has no intention of going beyond the honeymoon phase of a relationship. He may also be looking for the thrill of new romance elsewhere, continuing the cycle of manipulation.\\n\\nThis card often appears in a reading to denote a lover who has intimacy and commitment issues. His behavior may be inconsistent and unpredictable, but when challenged, he may protest that this is not the case and try to deflect the problem onto you. It is of course best for you to step away, as this knight has little to offer other than ongoing drama.\\n\\n# QUEEN OF CUPS\\n\\n**Element:** Water of the suit of Water\\n**Astrological Associations:** Gemini and Cancer\\n**Chakras:** Sacral, heart, and third eye, for creativity, love, and second sight\\n**Key Meaning:** An intuitive woman\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE QUEEN OF CUPS\\n\\nThe Queen of Cups can be considered as an aspect of card III, The Empress, or a mother archetype who brings love, kindness, and abundance. She respectfully holds up her treasure, an ornate golden chalice. With a cross atop it and two praying angels fixed on either side, it is a signifier of faith and spirituality. The chalice is closed, suggesting the sacredness of the womb and the creation of life.\\n\\nOn the card are three water-babies: one holding the prosperity symbol of the fish and the other two a pair, like the Queen\\'s sign of Gemini, sitting on each side of the throne top. The water-babies signify the Queen\\'s maternal instinct. The choice of water-baby and beach may have been inspired by a Victorian tale still popular in the period during which the Rider-Waite cards were created.\\n\\nCharles Kingsley\\'s novel *The Water-Babies: A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby* (1863) tells the story of Tom the chimney sweep, who is taken by fairies and turned into a water-baby. Kingsley tells the reader we must be open-minded to the existence of such things and that we know but \"the very smallest\" corner of the world—which can be likened to \"only a child picking up pebbles on the shore of a boundless ocean.\" Perhaps the Queen is sitting at the edge of Kingsley\\'s boundless ocean of knowledge, and the pebbles at her feet signify the elements of wisdom that come our way, washed up on the shore. These physical pebbles are repeated as a design on the Queen\\'s crown and as a cluster on the chalice. They look like golden nuggets, symbols of her generosity.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Water of Water, for intense emotions. The throne\\'s scallop shape reflects this Water element, echoed in the scallop brooch fixed at her heart, pink for love. The scallop echoes Botticelli\\'s *The Birth of Venus* (1486), which shows the goddess rising from the sea on a scallop shell—linking our Queen with Venus/Aphrodite, goddess of earthly and divine love. The fish-scale cloak falls into the water at the Queen\\'s feet, while water-swirls decorate the lower segments of the throne so she appears as one with the water. Even the plait of the Queen\\'s hair is scale-like, and the color is auburn, just like Botticelli\\'s Venus.\\n\\nQueens and Kings in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the Queen as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As a person:** The Queen of Cups predicts the positive influence of an intuitive, sensitive woman. She is nurturing and compassionate, with high emotional intelligence. Her work may be artistic, and she may also be drawn to medicine, caregiving, complementary therapies, certain types of sales work, or research in nonmainstream subjects. Given her sensitivity and natural empathy, this Queen has to choose her close friends carefully—but when she makes a connection with a person, she treasures him or her, just like her chalice.  This card often comes up in readings to show the ideal female partner, who is unafraid of intimacy while having stability and appropriate boundaries. It can predict motherhood and children, too.\\n\\n**As the \"you\" card in a reading:** Loving and giving, you make the world a better place.\\n\\n**As an influence:** Love and happiness are foremost—falling in love, loving behavior, and emotional honesty. All you need to do is follow your heart. Creative projects are favored, too. Pay attention, also, to your dreams, which hold messages for you.\\n\\nIf two or more Queens fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Queens: Rivalry\\n* Three Queens: Helpful friends\\n* Four Queens: Women meeting up\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the reversed Queen of Cups appears, you suffer emotional or financial pressure. There may be jealousy in a relationship, and most negatively, the card in this aspect can show that someone is unfaithful. As a person, the reversed Queen has obsessive tendencies, competes for attention, and needs to have her own way at all times. She drains those around her, so try not to facilitate her needs. She is not one to commit to love or contribute financially.\\n\\n# KING OF CUPS\\n\\n**Element:** Air of the suit of Water\\n**Astrological Associations:** Libra and Scorpio\\n**Chakras:** Heart, third eye, and solar plexus, for love, intuition, and wisdom\\n**Key Meaning:** A charismatic man\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE KING OF CUPS\\n\\nThe King of Cups can be considered as an aspect of card IV, The Emperor, or a father archetype who brings structure, order, and authority. His realm is the emotions.\\n\\nHe sits on a throne in the sea or ocean, comfortable but rock-steady despite the stormy outlook—the sailing ship on the horizon is listing in high winds, and waves are rising against a sky of white-gray. His throne is shell-shaped and, given this King\\'s apparent cool despite his isolation, echoes Greek god Triton, the merman who blew through a conch shell to control the rise and fall of the waves.\\n\\nHis emblem is the fish, for prosperity and faith, or passion, worn as an amulet around his neck; a small dolphin or fish also leaps into the picture from the left. The water is green, turquoise, and gray—the many colors of the emotions. On his crown are waves and red jellyfish. The jellyfish may be an apt reference to one of the King\\'s zodiac associations, Scorpio, a sign renowned for its deadly sting. The jellyfish may also link with the King as Perseus, the Greek god who beheaded the Gorgon Medusa—\"the \"medusa stage\" is a term describing a stage of the jellyfish\\'s development. Jellyfish pulsate to move but have little power to propel themselves on their own, so they also symbolize acceptance and trust.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Air of Water, for steam and clouds. As water evaporates with heat, so the King can convert Water to Air, transmuting feelings to ideas—the shift from heart to head. Like Triton, he is master of the waves and master of his emotions. This Air-Water combination can be challenging, however, as the King strives to find a balance between sharing his feelings and holding back.\\n\\nKings and Queens in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the King as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As a person:** The King of Cups shows a warmhearted, charismatic male. He might be an academic, lawyer, advisor, businessman, scientist, or artist. In his work, he follows his intuition. In friendships, he is sociable, but, like his counterpart the Queen of Cups, is sensitive and needs to choose his closest friends wisely. For this reason, he may have one or two confidants and a wide circle of acquaintances. While being empathic, at times he tries to control his feelings and can come across as distant. He often needs time to process his intense emotions before sharing them.\\n\\nThis card often comes up in readings to show the ideal romantic partner, who is unafraid of intimacy while having stability and appropriate boundaries. It can predict fatherhood and children, too.\\n\\n## As the \"you\" card in a reading: Follow your heart.\\n\\n## As an influence:\\nA need exists to settle a conflict, either within yourself or between you and others, usually in a work or family situation. You are unsure whether to be logical or left-field, to go with the consensus or go with a hunch. If in doubt, follow your intuition and let your heart rule. In negotiations, use all your charm and empathy. When others feel that you are really engaged with them, they will drop their defenses and communication will improve.\\n\\nIf two or more Kings fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Kings: A good partnership\\n* Three Kings: Influential men\\n* Four Kings: A power battle\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe reversed King reveals emotional vulnerability. If this applies to an individual in your life, you may be dealing with someone who is volatile right now. This person may be secretive, ashamed, and uncommunicative when not blaming others for their predicament. Thankfully, this situation is temporary and will change.\\n\\nAn additional meaning of the reversed card is a person with destructive behavior patterns and possibly addiction issues (see also card XV, The Devil, page 90).\\n\\n# ACE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThe Suit of Pentacles\\n\\n**Element:** Earth\\n**Astrological Associations:** The Earth signs—Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn\\n**Number:** 1\\n**Tree of Life Position:** Kether, the sphere of divine light\\n**Key Meanings:** Prosperity, property, and beginnings\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE ACE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nA hand appears from a cloud, offering a single golden coin. It is the only card of the suit to show a coin with a double border, as if to emphasis its value. The scene below the coin and hand depicts cultivated lilies and a rose garden with an arch forming an oval window looking onto a mountain view. This is wealthy land, where the owners can afford to grow their own lilies, symbols of purity. The clear view beyond the roses to white peaks signifies challenge and the ambition to succeed without hindrance. The message, though, is that this wealth is being offered to us, the holder of the card. The perfect garden, abundant with beautiful blooms, is an example of the prosperous lifestyle that the gift of the Ace may bring. The coin is offered with the right hand, the hand of giving (as opposed to the left hand, which traditionally is the receiving hand).\\n\\nThe golden coin is engraved with the symbol of the pentagram, which appears on all the cards of this suit. The pentagram is an ancient symbol for the four elements, plus the fifth element, or quintessence—the magical element of ether (see card I, The Magician, page 34). The arrangement of the pentagram points can also represent heaven over the earth. Heaven is represented as the uppermost point of the pentagram, which also links with the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Kether, for the divine light of God, or great spirit. The five points can also symbolize the body\\'s five senses, which relate to the cards\\' element of Earth, which is concerned with our physical experience in the world, as well as wealth and productivity.\\n\\nThe Aces offer the pure energy of their suits. As number ones, they represent oneness with the divine spirit or God. Indivisible, their energy is singular, strong, and purposeful. They all represent beginnings, impulses, and new possibilities, in the most pure and obvious form.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright meaning of the Ace of Pentacles is auspicious for every aspect of your life. In a spread, it overrules other minor arcana cards close by (just like XIX, The Sun). The Ace predicts happiness and contentment; you can have what you desire. Traditionally, it predicts prosperity, and you find money comes to you quickly, either as a windfall or win, or you are shown the way to achieve it. In this sense, the card presents an opportunity for further attainment, so now is the time to receive the precious gift or opportunity on offer and use it to maximize your potential. You may find a way to use it to build for the future, as property is favored in the suit of Pentacles. In readings, it commonly arises to show money is coming or a new property; it also predicts foundation and stability, so if you have questions concerning your home or relationship, you will receive what you need in abundance. One message of the card, too, is not to doubt your good fortune. You deserve it. In a reading, one Ace brings a focus on the life area according to the suit, which can set the theme of the reading. If two or more Aces appear near each other in a reading, it means as follows:\\n\\n* Two Aces: An important partnership\\n* Three Aces: Good news\\n* Four Aces: Excitement, beginnings, and potential\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Ace reverses, it reveals greed and holding fast to one outcome. This desperation can cause materialistic thinking, and when you are fixed to one goal, other aspects of your life may suffer. The card can show unwise investment of time or money, so be aware of the motives of those you invest with or work for; this can be a difficult time when you are treated unfairly by an unscrupulous person or organization. Money for work you have done may not materialize. The reversed Ace of Pentacles also shows financial mismanagement and mistakes; as a prediction card in a reading, it advises not to make major financial decisions at present.\\n\\nIn personal relationships, the card can show that someone close becomes grasping and materialistic and selfishly wants to keep everything for themselves. The card can also show gambling and reckless spending.\\n\\n# TWO OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Jupiter in Capricorn\\nNumber: 2\\nTree of Life Position: Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom\\nKey Meaning: Negotiation\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE TWO OF PENTACLES\\n\\nA young man appears to be dancing, holding two coins joined on a green thread in the shape of a figure-eight, for infinity and the continuity of life. The same symbol appears in card I, The Magician, and VIII, Strength, and stands for balance, activity, and renewal. The flow of this never-ending symbol also suggests consistency and patience. In the case of the Two of Pentacles, the youth\\'s concern is cash flow; he appears to be dancing but is actually juggling his coins to respond to changing circumstances, shown by the two boats in the background that rise and fall on the waves.\\n\\nAt this point, he is considering two options. He needs to be practical and use his head to make a decision and find balance, which is symbolized by his tall red hat—at the moment, his dilemma is all in his mind and he has yet to take action. Hats of this style, known as acorn hats, were worn by artisans and courtiers in the fifteenth century but were usually shorter than that of our coin-dancer. It seems his hat was purposefully elongated by the card\\'s artist, Pamela Colman Smith, to emphasize thinking, although another interpretation may be self-delusion, or big-headedness, which is evidenced by the reversed meaning of the card.\\n\\nTwo is the number of partnership, and in the Two of Pentacles, the focus is on two people or two opposing forces. The continual tension between these two forces keeps the coins spinning on the figure-eight, so the situation perpetuates. When a decision is made, the tension evaporates.\\n\\nOn the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom and the father, echoed in the phallic hat of the young man on the card. He needs to decide between two options or courses of action, and to do this, he needs to draw upon his wisdom.\\n\\nThe astrological association of Jupiter in Capricorn reveals strength and resourcefulness. The challenge of this combination for the Two of Pentacles is the pull between paying close attention to immediate detail and stepping back to see the long-term impact of the actions he takes.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nIn the upright position, the card shows making a decision and in particular, managing money. There may be temporary cash-flow issues, and you\\'ll need consistent effort to balance the books. If your income is up and down, an unexpected expenditure can hit hard; this is a common card for freelancers whose income varies from month to month, as well as for two people in business together. On a more positive note, the card says that if you pay close attention to financial and property matters, you will manage well, even on a tight budget. As a personality trait in the person/situation position in a spread, the Two of Pentacles indicates fairness and a willingness to find a good balance between work and personal life. In readings, the card often comes up to show two properties and sometimes making a decision about where to live—in particular, a choice between home and a property abroad. This may also reveal a choice between two jobs in different places and weighing the pros and cons of each offer. An additional meaning is news that comes in writing, so you may receive an important letter or email.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nIn the reversed position, egotism and pride can get in the way of practicality. Irresponsible spending may cause hardship, and these financial mistakes may be hidden—gambling is a common meaning here, as well as a generally reckless attitude toward money. In work, you may be dealing with an unreasonable boss who is unrealistic about what can be achieved, putting you under needless pressure. The card can also show the ending of a business partnership due to financial difficulties; one of you may be investing more resources into the business than the other. The message is to observe closely just how committed you and your colleagues are and if the contribution is fair and equal.\\n\\n# THREE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Mars in Capricorn\\nNumber: 3\\nTree of Life Position: Binah, the sphere of understanding\\nKey Meanings: Enterprise and success\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE THREE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThe Three of Pentacles shows a stonemason at work on a church, following a plan held up by a figure clad in a strange orange cloak. Symbolizing lifelong vocation, a monk stands by, observing the work on his building. Our mason stands on a workbench, similar to that shown on the Eight of Pentacles; both the Three and the Eight show a craftsman at work. The man in Eight has finished his apprenticeship and graduated into the Three, the qualified craftsman who works independently. The three coins are a part of the church\\'s design; his ideas are embedded in the structure of the building. His contribution will be lasting, set in stone.\\n\\nThe mason is working by a half-open door, signifying that his good work and reputation will open doors for him in the future. He wears a tunic of rich purple, the color of high office in the church, to show that he is spiritually in tune with his talents and beliefs. This also aligns with Binah, his Tree of Life sphere, which means understanding. He fully comprehends his brief and knows how to direct his skills to best effect.\\n\\nIt\\'s also notable that the mason appears in a public space, where he can be seen. He is proud to show his work, and the art he creates is accessible to all—which is more important than the money he will be paid. Of note, too: This is the only Pentacles card that shows the coins in black; they are a representation of lasting satisfaction rather than a reward of literal golden coins.\\n\\nIn numerology, three is a dynamic number (see also card III, The Empress, page 42). We can interpret this as mother, father, child—with the mason as the mother (of his own inventions); the father, the mentor of his apprenticeship; and the child, the work the mason creates.\\n\\nThe Three of Pentacles is associated with Mars in Capricorn, which highlights strong ambition and often applies to people who are self-starters. The challenge with this combination is to avoid obsession and sidelining other life aspects with their drive to succeed.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright meaning of the Three of Pentacles is rewarding work. It often shows you are ready to let your talents shine in public, and the card often appears in readings to show launching a business, receiving a commission, giving a lecture or teaching, or presiding over an important event; specifically, it can also show making a speech at a graduation or wedding, for example.\\n\\nIn domestic affairs, the card can predict building or improvement work to your home or putting a property up for sale. The Three of Pentacles is also a good card for creatives, predicting that projects will be finished and appreciated. The work may also be displayed in a public space.\\n\\nAccording to tarot scholar Jonathan Dee, the Three of Pentacles is sometimes called the Architect, which means you establish a lasting enterprise, a project that \"causes you to stand head and shoulders above both friends and enemies alike.\" The downside, of course, as you succeed and become visibly successful, is the touch of envy you may sense around you; it may feel uncomfortable, as you\\'re not used to negative attention. This jealousy, as with elements of all minor arcana cards, is transitory and will not dint your confidence or harm your progress. Detractors can only make you stronger.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Three of Pentacles reverses, work is tiresome and you may not be willing to put in the groundwork—or indeed to work at all. This may be because you feel you\\'ve seen it all before and have become cynical about finding a career that will suit, or you take on a role for the perceived glamor—or the way it is sold to you—and later realize that the work is mostly tedium. You\\'ll need to push through the dull details or make a swift decision to move on.\\n\\nAnother interpretation of the card is poor planning so a project doesn\\'t succeed. In property affairs, it can show builders who do not finish the work they begin.\\n\\n# FOUR OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Sun in Capricorn\\nNumber: 4\\nTree of Life Position: Chesed, the sphere of love\\nKey Meanings: Security, self-improvement, and holding on to money\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE FOUR OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThe male figure we see on the Four of Pentacles has set himself up as a king, complete with a simple crown and stone throne, set just a little above the town behind him. His purpose is to elevate himself socially and financially and create a stable base for his future. The red colors of his gown show he has focused his energy in practical ways to create a firm foundation for himself, and now that he has achieved this, he wears a black cloak of protection to safeguard his assets. He needs to keep this money for himself.\\n\\nThe components of the card are almost symmetrical, expressing his number four, for the concept of balance. However, what is notable is how connected this man is to his money. He has a foot on each on two coins, one attached to his crown, and one held tight against center of his body. Symbolically, his money grounds him (at his feet); it is literally at his heart, at the center of his being; and at the crown of the head, it reflects his mind-set and beliefs. His arms, wrapped around the sides of the coin, almost look unnaturally twisted in his effort have physical contact with every part of its curve. He has made sure that no other hand can touch it, but it has also become a part of his identity. Wearing his coin on his crown means he is proud to show he is now a person of means and has risen through the ranks of the streets in the background to become a self-made man of note. He holds the central coin rather like a wheel—a sign that he believes money makes the world go round.\\n\\nIn numerology, four represents stability. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the individual sphere associated with this card is Chesed, for love. In the case of this Four of Pentacles, it indicates love for possessions and a strong desire for stability—even though there may be an emotional cost, which is reflected in the reversed meaning of the card.\\n\\nThe Four of Pentacles has an astrological association with the Sun in Capricorn, highlighting practicality and resilience, although super-solar Capricorn can be abrasive. Positively, Sun in Capricorn traits make for strong leadership and problem-solving.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright Four of Pentacles shows the need for stability and establishing a firm foundation. If you have suffered past hardship, the Four of Pentacles shows the tough times are over, as now your work pays off. While this doesn\\'t indicate a huge windfall (look to the Ten of Pentacles for this), you will have enough money and acknowledgment to feel satisfied. The card also shows protection of assets and traditional values. Proving a strong foundation for a growing family may be important to you now, so you may consider moving to a new home or investing in a small business that will bring you future dividends. In work, you attain a position that is very secure, so if your work is temporary, for example, the Four of Pentacles can show you being offered a permanent contract. An additional meaning of the card is the miser, as the male figure is clinging hard to his coin, but this money has come from hard work. You will value what you have achieved, and for now, want to keep it for yourself.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Four of Pentacles reveals an overly materialistic individual, a would-be king—male or female—who holds too fast to status and possessions. If this is you, try to let go of insecurity, as this can take up much of your head space—and feed an ongoing belief that you will never have enough. In work, the card can reveal that you miss opportunities because your confidence is low, and changes to your role may leave you feeling disempowered. It\\'s therefore important to do well in any professional or educational tests now; you may need to put in more work than first anticipated.  The reversed Four of Pentacles can also suggest a person who is showy and even a little smug; in a position of power over you, you may find this individual controlling and self-centered.\\n\\n# FIVE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Mercury in Taurus\\nNumber: 5\\nTree of Life Position: Geburah, the sphere of power\\nKey Meaning: A test of resources\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThe Five of Pentacles features a snow scene showing two impoverished people suffering a harsh winter. It is reminiscent of Dickens\\'s 1843 novel *A Christmas Carol* and its child character, Tiny Tim, a disabled boy on crutches. The beggar in the Rider-Waite deck appears to be a small grown man—an adult Tiny Tim, still struggling to survive years on. Around his neck is a bell, which in medieval times was worn by lepers to warn others of their approach. He has become untouchable and excluded from society.\\n\\nThe woman accompanying him is barefoot and gray-haired, wearing a red cloak. The color shows she will persist, despite their predicament—but what she cannot yet grasp is any possibility of change. The pair are fixed on surviving the elements and do not notice the window above, with its depiction of a money tree of five coins and a safe, solid property behind it. Even if the paupers could raise their heads to face the biting wind, this idyllic scene would seem a world away from their reality. The stained glass also reminds us of church windows. As the man and woman are not part of the church, and do not venture inside, there is a sense of being excluded from a spiritual community.\\n\\nOn the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Geburah, or power; its additional meaning is destruction and cruelty, echoing the suffering of the two beggars. We might also interpret this harsh sphere as a message to relinquish our victimhood and take back our power, whatever knocks we endure.\\n\\nThe astrological association of Mercury in Taurus is an uncomfortable, and often incompatible, combination. Mercury is lined with speed and communication, while the influence of Taurus is slow and steady. In the Five of Pentacles, this can reveal a contrary influence that brings frustration and at times the inability to make consistent progress.\\n\\nFive is the number of mankind. Five is also the quintessence, or fifth element in alchemy. The five coins on the card give us the meaning that there is still something to be discovered that is not yet obvious—like the quintessence, it is invisible now, but may be revealed later.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe traditional meaning of this Five of Pentacles is financial loss, so when it shows up in a reading, it can mean losing a job or a relationship or experiencing some other financial or emotional hardship. The positive aspect is that you find support from others in a similar position. These contacts may become good friends whom you may never have met in your usual circumstances. Consider new options, and you may discover another resource or approach that will help you see a way forward.\\n\\nHowever, this card often comes up in readings to show a fear of poverty and isolation, rather than actual poverty. It also commonly shows a fear of losing the security of home and/or the aftermath of a relationship breakup, with one partner feeling alone and depleted. It occasionally reveals the impact of bereavement. While tarot cards do not predict death, the Five of Pentacles when in the present/situation position in a reading (rather than the future position) can reflect the feelings of sadness as a result of losing someone close.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThere\\'s a moral theme to the interpretation for the reversed Five of Pentacles, in that the card asks you to examine your values. If you\\'re clinging to objects, people, or money, what are you avoiding? Fear of change could lead you to ignore debt or become oblivious to growing tension in a relationship. Hoarding old possessions and memories shows you need to feel safe for now and don\\'t have the confidence or the faith that you will be supported in the future—at least, just at present. As with all minor arcana cards, though, this is a temporary influence.\\n\\nIn relationships, you may suffer due to a partner\\'s selfish behavior. This person doesn\\'t want to give to you emotionally, or he or she withholds money. The card can also show you being ill-treated by an ex-partner who doesn\\'t pay what is due.\\n\\n# SIX OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Moon in Taurus\\nNumber: 6\\nTree of Life Position: Tiphareth, the sphere of beauty and rebirth\\nKey Meaning: Property, family, inheritance\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE SIX OF PENTACLES\\n\\nLike the figure of card XI, Justice, the young nobleman on the Six of Pentacles holds a pair of scales, and he is dressed in red, the color of energy and practicality. His mantle is purple, the color of intuition and spirituality—and a sign that he acts in good faith. He wears a blue-striped tunic—the only other Pentacle card with this stripe is the Nine, in which the woman shows one blue stripe beneath her robe. Both these cards share the virtue of generosity. Our nobleman is judicious, weighing the situation with the scales of mercy in his left hand and giving out coins with his right hand.\\n\\nThe two figures kneeling before him are beggars. One is wounded, wearing sackcloth and a bandage around his head; the other, young and poor, his blue cloak bearing a patch. Because of his blue, we know he is experiencing true poverty and deserves help. The men exist in a barren place beyond the city walls and its greenery, and there is nothing to succor them. The white sky gives a feeling of uncertainty—it is not yellow and joyful, nor blue, for clarity—but this wealthy man gives money regardless of what the outcome might be.\\n\\nSix is the number of harmony and passivity. For the beggars, this is the ability to surrender and accept, which brings some serenity, even temporarily. The particular arrangement of the coin symbols might be a representation of the Hebrew letter Kaph on its side—Kaph means palm and what might be in the palm. On this card, the palms give and receive coins. Six also has the meaning of the past creating the present and future, so money earned or saved in the past may now be shared.\\n\\nThe Tree of Life sphere associated with this card is Tiphareth, the sphere of beauty and rebirth, relating to the beauty of the generous soul. The Six of Pentacles has an astrological association with the Moon in Taurus, highlighting stability with sensitivity. This means being able to be generous without patronizing the recipient and also knowing how to receive help graciously.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright card shows that money is coming to you. It may arrive as a gift or an award and may be donated by an individual rather than an organization. This allows you to pay off any outstanding debt and/or invest the money wisely in your future. If you have been struggling financially, this card is a welcome sign that your circumstances will certainly improve. Equally, the card can show that you are the benefactor, so you may help a friend in need with a temporary cash-flow problem, or you feel drawn to support a charity that is close to your heart. Whomever you choose to help, you will consider carefully his or her needs and offer the right amount to make a difference. Overall, this card brings genuine support and predicts you feeling connected and close to your usual circle of friends and family. Together, you may be exchanging small gifts of appreciation. An additional meaning is receiving help or money from a person from your past or using savings to help another person.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Six of Pentacles shows money coming to you but you cannot keep it—usually due to carelessness or theft. A traditional meaning of the card is having your purse or wallet stolen, and this message is reinforced if the reversed card is placed close to the Seven of Swords, the \"thief\" card of the minor arcana (see page 88). Guard your possessions carefully and watch what you spend so that enough money stays in your pocket. The reversed card also suggests there may be envy due to money, so monitor your attitudes and the attitudes of people around you.\\n\\nAn alternative interpretation is an offer of money, but it comes with conditions that are not acceptable to you. The message here is not to compromise and to say no if you need to. There will be other options.\\n\\n# SEVEN OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Saturn in Taurus\\nNumber: 7\\nTree of Life Position: Netzach, the sphere of endurance, instinct, and desire\\nKey Meanings: Work and the potential for success\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE SEVEN OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThe Seven of Pentacles is a card of potential success. A young man considers his treasure, six coins arranged on a vine and a seventh at his feet. This is the same vine we see on the \"bounty\" cards of this suit—the joyful Four of Pentacles, luxury-loving Nine, the established Ten, and the wealthy King (see pages 154, 164, 166, and 174). Here, on the Seven of Pentacles, the vine is established, with large, healthy leaves—but there are no grapes. The plant is not mature enough yet to bear its full fruit. The man leans on his hoe, his magical object of transformation, as he painstakingly tends the land to nurture his vine. Slowly and with effort, it will bear him fruit. According to A. E. Waite, the creator of the Rider-Waite cards, \"One would say that these are his treasures and that his heart was there.\" The six coins on the tree show what must be saved for the future, and the single coin represents his disposable income, or what he can spend now on himself. This is small reward for now, but there is more to come, provided he can keep going and not rest too long contemplating his situation.\\n\\nOur grafter wears a tunic of red, to symbolize his energy, and blue, showing he is following his true purpose. His feet, like his vine, are firmly planted in the soil. He may be taking stock of his achievement as he gazes at his coins, but he will have to keep going if he is to see his ideas ripen and reward come. The purple mountains echo those on the Two and Three of Wands, and stand for goals and using our intuition.\\n\\nThe card\\'s astrological association, Saturn in Taurus, means endeavor. The influence of the taskmaster planet Saturn leaves no room for fantastical plans and proposals—whatever you do must be grounded, organized, and nurtured with consistent effort. Netzach, the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, stands for endurance, so the combined astrological and kabbalistic meaning of the card is long-term dedication.\\n\\nThe card\\'s number is the mystical number seven. Seven is composed of three, the number of heaven, and four, the number of earth, so the challenge is to bring heaven down to earth—to makes your dreams reality (see VII, The Chariot, page xx). In the Seven of Pentacles, this reward comes from work, work, work—and keeping your eye on the prize.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThere\\'s a goal in sight, and you are close to achieving it—but now is not the time to stop and reflect. The Seven of Pentacles is the card of doing, not philosophizing, so keep your focus on what you want and believe you can achieve it. This effort may feel relentless, but your hard work will pay off.\\n\\nThe card often comes up in readings to show the need to keep the focus on your career goals or to work through a particularly tedious stage in a current project that leaves you feeling tired and deflated. You might be tired of the relentlessness of it all, but the reward will come as long as you don\\'t falter. Also, the Seven can show saving for a home or accruing funds and clients to expand a business. In domestic affairs, the Seven of Pentacles can show there\\'s not enough money left for the little luxuries that make all the effort of saving worthwhile. Whatever your situation, keep going—you are nearly there, and in the future, you will thank yourself for your dedication.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Seven of Pentacles means procrastination. Time is running out, so commit fully to the work you\\'re doing or the lifestyle you have, regardless of the ups and downs—or put your energies elsewhere. This may mean considering a different job or career path. You may have become disheartened with slow—or no—progress in your work or improvement in your finances, but while you\\'re in the doldrums, opportunities can slip away. Muster your willpower and take action now: Any decision is better than no decision at all.\\n\\nAn additional meaning of the card is anxiety about a loan or other financial agreement. If this is affecting your motivation, try to renegotiate terms, rather than give up now.\\n\\n# EIGHT OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Sun in Virgo\\nNumber: 8\\nTree of Life Position: Hod, the sphere of majesty and the mind\\nKey Meanings: Education and achievement\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE EIGHT OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThe Eight of Pentacles depicts an apprentice at work. He is highly productive, and the tree, a symbol for growth, displays his creations—he works hard, and has eight coins to show for it. Dressed in blue and red, for energy and truth of purpose, he also wears a black apron, the vestment of a mason or smith. While the apron gives him practical protection during his work, the color black figuratively symbolizes protection, just like the merchant\\'s black cloak on the Four of Pentacles (see page 154). In the Eight, the apprentice\\'s budding knowledge and expertise will afford him protection from financial vulnerability in the future. A solid education and skill will equip him to earn the good living he deserves. While the atmosphere he works in is uncertain—the impassive gray-white sky gives no clue to future trends, unlike other cards with blue or sunny skies to set the tone—he keeps his head down regardless, attentive to his task.\\n\\nThe city in the background is distant, so he may have made a conscious decision to study or work away from familiar comforts. He may have traveled for work away from home, which, while not a convenient choice, shows his ambition and dedication to walk his own path.\\n\\nThe apprentice\\'s work is repetitive, doing the same job over and again until he has mastered his skill. He takes pride in his work. However, he could be overly perfectionist, as one coin seems to have been discarded and left on the floor, while the others are displayed. He has high standards and needs to achieve excellence at all times. This personality trait relates to the card\\'s astrological association of the Sun in Virgo. Virgoan qualities include attention to detail and practicality, but there is also a tendency toward self-criticism. The apprentice is analytic and mindful, linking with the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Hod. Its common meaning is majesty, and in this Eight of Pentacles refers to the mastery of the mind.\\n\\nThe card\\'s number is eight, which stands for stability and renewal (see also card VIII, Strength, page 62). The eights in the minor arcana, as they are nearing the end of the numbered sequence, hold all our experiences up to that point. We have past knowledge to draw upon, which gives us wisdom and enables new choices—a time to renew our skills and find a fresh direction.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nMoney is on its way, often as a result of previous efforts or decisions rather than an unexpected bonus or gift. (Look to the Six or Ten of Pentacles for generosity and windfalls.) You may be offered an opportunity to gain new skills that will be profitable in the long term. You may also consider a new career direction or be working for promotion. In general, the card also reflects the need for a logical, diligent approach to your projects.\\n\\nThis card is often known as the apprentice. It comes up in readings to show education and gaining a qualification, particularly an undergraduate degree or diploma. The Eight of Pentacles also shows a personality aspect, so if it appears in the \"you/situation\" position in a spread, it reveals a hardworking, trustworthy, and dedicated individual who takes his or her responsibilities seriously.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe reversed Eight of Pentacles can show that you\\'re feeling trapped. This may be because you\\'ve chosen an educational course that isn\\'t for you and doesn\\'t develop your particular talents or reflect your interests enough to be sustainable long term. In work, you may know you\\'re only doing the job for the money. While this may be acceptable on a short-term basis, long term it feels soul-destroying. While supporting yourself financially, it may be time to look elsewhere rather than let the situation continue.\\n\\nAs a prediction card, the Eight of Pentacles shows a cycle is about to come to an end, so rather than wait for this to happen, conserve your energy and direct it toward finding a new career. Don\\'t resign yourself to your present situation if there\\'s no sense of achievement or appreciation.\\n\\n# NINE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Venus in Virgo\\nNumber: 9\\nTree of Life Position: Yesod, the sphere of foundation and the unconscious mind\\nKey Meanings: Comfort, accomplishment, and prosperity\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE NINE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThe Nine of Pentacles is a card of comfort, luxury, and attainment. Here we have a country idyll—a manor house protected by hills and before us, a woman standing proud in her vineyard. These are grapes she has cultivated herself, shown by the two green loops holding the vines to wooden supports on the right of the card. In this rich and plentiful land, the lady of the house tends her nine coins and lays her right hand over one coin protectively. Her treasure might remind us of hay bales, harvested and piled in summer fields, their circular ends stacked like the faces of coins. Note that the piles of coins are unequal: She keeps six to her right and three to her left. Those on her right feel like hers to keep, while those on the left might be coins to give away. By ensuring she gives away less than she receives, she will maintain her standard of living.\\n\\nHer hat is red, for passion and energy, and the lining of her gown is also red. This red lining offers a connection with the womb and its implicit fertility. This woman is fertile in her thoughts and tends her garden with the utmost love and care. The flower symbol on her robe is similar in form to the glyph of Venus, for her ruling planet, also the symbol for the female.\\n\\nThe small bird on her gauntlet is curious—its head is covered with a red hood, showing that it is temporarily tamed; wild instincts are under control. Although birds are often symbols of spirit, when domesticated or restrained, they can also signify vanity. Because the bird is temporarily hooded (rather than chained or caged), we sense that this woman is alert to the dangers of using money to exert control. She guards against materialism and egotism. Her kabbalistic and astrological associations account for this level of self-awareness. Luxury-loving, passionate Venus is tempered by Virgo\\'s conservatism and attention to detail. The card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Yesod, means foundation. Yesod is associated with the Moon, ruler of the unconscious mind.\\n\\nThe card\\'s number is nine, or three sets of three. Three is a dynamic number, and when multiplied by itself, symbolizes intense productivity. It also holds the message of the three aspects of the goddess (maiden, mother, and crone), as well as the integration of mind, body, and spirit. In the Nine of Pentacles, this can show that the lady\\'s financial security feeds her mentally and spiritually, allowing her to live abundantly and give generously to others.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Nine ushers in a time of financial stability. You can feel safe in your home and proud of your achievements. At last, you can surround yourself with the material objects you love, and you may find yourself redecorating your home or tending your garden or yard. It\\'s time to appreciate all that you have, so leisure time beckons; treat yourself to whatever makes you happy and enjoy the fruits of your work. You will be able to focus on your own needs without feeling guilty. The Nine also brings a sense of serenity and relaxation, so the card predicts you can feel at home, and at one, with yourself.\\n\\nThis card often comes up in a reading to show a woman of independent means who is generous and well balanced. In this way, the Nine of Pentacles is similar to the Queen of Pentacles (see page 172), although the Queen\\'s influence is generally greater. In work matters, the card can predict financial reward, such as a bonus, for your efforts.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the card can show vanity and ego at large—the urge for material wealth gets out of control, so overspending (or dealing with a loved one\\'s overspending) may need to be confronted. In general, the card can show financial dependence that is uncomfortable or misuse of money for selfish means.\\n\\nAn additional meaning is feeling that your home is somehow under threat because you are struggling with debt. Don\\'t struggle alone—help is at hand.\\n\\n# TEN OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Mercury in Virgo\\nNumber: 10\\nTree of Life Position: Malkuth, the Kingdom, the sphere of experience\\nKey Meanings: Property, family, and inheritance\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE TEN OF PENTACLES\\n\\nA happy couple and their dogs face each other under an archway, the formal entrance to a prosperous home. We spy a house in a walled courtyard, and there is a prominent high tower—possibly an obvious sexual symbol to show a love relationship or a signifier for the traditional, learning, and protection.\\n\\nAn older man looks on, seated in a thronelike chair. He is the King of Pentacles grown old, now with white hair, but still wearing his grapevine cloak (see page 174). By his presence alone, he appears to give the pair his blessing; it is now their turn to inherit the values of the family through marriage. We see three generations here, the grandfather-king, his son or daughter and their beloved, and a small child, presumably theirs or the offspring of another relative. Each generation seems quite separate from one another, but they happily share the same space.\\n\\nAll is in perfect balance. The ten coins on the card are symmetrical and represent the Tree of Life. The four elements are represented, too, equally. We see watery scenes on the coats of arms on the bridge; for the Earth element, there are grapevines; the woman\\'s cloak is red, for Fire: and the sky over the bridge gives us the element of Air. All four elements exist in harmony.\\n\\nIn numerology, ten represents completeness and perfection. In the Ten of Pentacles, this shows happy stability, emotionally and financially. The ten coins are laid out in the shape of the kabalistic Tree of Life (see page 234)—each one representing a sphere on the tree and each sphere having an esoteric concept. The whole tree links with the card\\'s meaning of maturity and completeness. The individual sphere associated with this card is Malkuth, for kingdom—so the Ten of Pentacles celebrates our personal kingdom or our material world.\\n\\nThe Ten\\'s astrological association of Mercury in Virgo highlights practical affairs as well as the physical body. This combination also shows the ability to find specific solutions to problems.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright Ten of Pentacles shows an inheritance, generosity, and a love relationship that brings wealth and happiness—so if you are asking the question, \"Will my current relationship get more committed?\" the answer will be a resounding yes. The Ten of Pentacles often comes up in readings to show a wedding. What is even better is that the couple shares similar values and often has similar cultural backgrounds (and the two families actually like one another.)\\n\\nAn additional meaning is inherited property, buying a second home, or extending your current home, again with family support. At this time, you also benefit from sharing your time, resources, skills, or money to help each other out. Note that family in this context signifies those you consider family and treat as such, so this could relate to a close circle of longtime friends. This card also suggests maturity. You can interpret this in financial terms, with investments maturing, as well as in emotional terms, as the emotional maturity that comes with life experience. You may find that an older person in the family has wisdom to share in addition to resources.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Ten of Pentacles reveals communication problems in families as one generation tries to dominate another; children and parents disagree and have very different attitudes. The card can highlight contention over a specific issue, such as conflict over property or money. Equally, general attitudes toward finances may be at the heart of the problem. This card often comes up in readings to show overly strict parents who try to control their families with money. There is also an issue with status here as traditional values block freedom of expression. Older people may find it hard to accept that their children want to do things differently. In romantic relationships, money, property issues, and the demands of family get in the way of love. Ambition takes over; personal life comes second.\\n\\n# PAGE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Earth of the suit of Earth\\nKey Meanings: Talent shines and money news\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE PAGE OF PENTACLES\\n\\nUnlike the wary Page of Swords, the Page of Pentacles is entirely absorbed in his coin rather than in his surroundings. He holds the money lightly, like a precious object, a gift that will become an accolade, an award for his talents. Around him are low mountains, ploughed fields, grass, and trees—a landscape of plenty—and this fertile place of possibility is his natural home. Four trees in the distance tell us that his good fortune has come from seeds he diligently tended. He can admire his coin in the knowledge that he will always be supported: Turning his attention to one issue does not mean any other life aspect will suffer, and he does not need to look over his shoulder for challengers hoping for a share of his glory. In this way, the Page is the opposite of poverty consciousness. With his youthful optimism, he assumes he will always have everything he needs.\\n\\nThe Page\\'s red headgear stands for energy and passion. His scarf is draped over his shoulder and extends down his back, signifying his wholehearted motivation. The yellow background and coin symbolize the intellect and solar consciousness: this Page is proud to let his light shine.\\n\\nEarth of Earth is the Page\\'s elemental association. What he achieves comes from the ground up, like the card\\'s trees, with solid roots and foundation. He begins with a solid plan and an aim to establish something great. As double Earth, he may not be idealistic, but he is practical, sees through his ideas, and is loyal to his purpose.\\n\\nPages and Knights in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Page in a reading by working with the card\\'s imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As an influence:** This Page reveals progress and adventure, as well as auspicious beginnings. This is a time to nurture your skills and abilities. There will be good news concerning finances, business, education, and travel. The Page of Pentacles also highlights the need for management, and in work matters, there may be an opportunity to manage people and projects. This Page often appears to show a job offer or an offer made on a property.\\n\\nThe card does come with an element of caution, however: There is a real need for attention to detail now and for diligence in all practical affairs, so double-check all arrangements and agreements. Also, check through your personal schedule to ensure everything you plan is realistic. The Page of Pentacles can also be a sign that it\\'s time to attend to finances; he comes up in readings to nudge us to do our taxes and renew outstanding insurance policies.\\n\\n# As a person:\\nHardworking and methodical, reliable and dedicated—this Page is practical and trustworthy. As a Page he is a younger person, or someone with youthful vigor. He may be starting out in the world, or in a new line of business. He may not have money now, but he has the potential to achieve great things in future, so you can believe in him and his plans; he will succeed, and he will not give up.  The card can also show a young person\\'s achievement and reward for his or her efforts in sport or education.\\n\\n# As the \"you\" card in a reading:\\nMoney and opportunities beckon—you have an opportunity to establish a new venture.\\n\\n# As an influence:\\nIf two or more Pages fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Pages: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed\\n* Three Pages: Lots of social activities\\n* Four Pages: A social group of young people\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Page of Pentacles is reversed, there may be unwelcome news regarding finances or property. Unlike the responsible upright Page, the card in this position means extravagance and irresponsibility rule. You may suffer due to someone else\\'s selfish actions. This may apply to young people you live with or to friends with immature tendencies. The card can also apply to a person with a sense of entitlement who helps himself to what is yours; while this is not necessarily theft, it is underhanded. Observe and take note for future reference.\\n\\n# KNIGHT OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Fire of the suit of Earth\\nAstrological Associations: Leo and Virgo\\nKey Meaning: Improving prosperity\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE KNIGHT OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThis is the only Knight of the tarot\\'s four minor suits whose horse is at rest, which seems at odds with the usual mission of a Knight, galloping boldly onward to fulfill a quest. The steed of the Knight of Pentacles—built more for pulling a plough than raging into battle—symbolizes a measured approach, very unlike that of the dashing Knight of Swords, who rushes headlong toward his goal. This Knight\\'s mission is long term; he has no interest in hasty action and will work hard and long to ensure his success.\\n\\nThe plumes on the horse bridle and the Knight\\'s helmet are green, the color of nature. They resemble a cluster of oak leaves, a reminder of the idiom \"From acorns great oaks come.\" This gives us the meaning of investment for the future, a concept supported by the fields of rich terracotta soil; the time is right for sowing, and we might even imagine the Knight planting his coin in those furrows and waiting for money trees to grow.\\n\\nThe Knight of Pentacles is methodical and thinks ahead; he is fully prepared for his journey. The blanket under the saddle shows that he has equipped his horse for the discomfort of a long day\\'s ride, and behind the saddle is a black book; he\\'s brought something to read during rest periods or perhaps it is a notebook in which to record his progress. The card\\'s element is Fire of the suit of Earth, and for this reason, the Knight of Pentacles has the ingredients of steady purpose—Fire energy to drive him forwards and Earth energy to help him plan and rationalize his ideas.\\n\\nThe Knight holds his coin in his right hand, which is the same color yellow as the sky. Like the Page of Pentacles, he sees potential prosperity all around him. His coin is not hidden, and he is clear that financial security is his central concern. The red of his tunic and the horse\\'s bridles show he has energy, and like the other minor Knights, his blue armor shows he is true to his purpose.\\n\\nKnights and Pages in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Knight in a reading by working with the card\\'s imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nAs an influence: Showing financial growth and good investment, this card means plans concerning property progress. With strategizing and setting a realistic goal, you will succeed. Pay attention to the practical details now, and future benefits are assured. Day to day, this Knight asks you to get through boring and routine, but essential, tasks. In work, the card can indicate more money coming to you due to a raise, bonus, or promotion, but you may need to work harder in return. An additional meaning of the card is finding a secure home, potentially with a partner.\\n\\nAs a person: This Knight is loyal and dependable. He is a natural protector, and security is very important to him. He may work in property or finance. As a potential partner, he has much to offer and is genuine. For some, he may lack excitement, as he plans rather than reacts; he can be slow to judge and to express his feelings, and keeps on safe subjects. Depending on what you need from a relationship, he could be a gift—your rock through thick and thin. If you crave excitement, he won\\'t be entertaining enough to capture your heart\\n\\nAs the \"you\" card in a reading: Invest your time wisely. Be consistent in your efforts.\\n\\nAs an influence: If two or more Knights fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Knights: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed\\n* Three Knights: Men meeting up\\n* Four Knights: Lots of action; events speed up\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the card advises that you avoid complacency and check out all financial arrangements. The most negative interpretation of the card is financial mismanagement and misleading advice.\\n\\nAs a person, the reversed knight is stubborn and cannot see others\\' viewpoints. He is plodding and pessimistic, reluctant to take action and unwilling to go beyond his comfort zone. He may tend to be materialistic and secretive and, in extremis, dishonest.\\n\\n# QUEEN OF PENTACLES\\n\\n**Element:** Water of the suit of Earth\\n**Astrological Associations:** Sagittarius and Capricorn\\n**Chakras:** Base and solar plexus, for security (earthiness) and wisdom\\n**Key Meaning:** A reliable woman\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE QUEEN OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThe Queen of Pentacles is an aspect of card III, The Empress, or mother archetype. The Queen of Cups is the heart, the Queen of Swords, the mind, and the Queen of Wands, the soul (see pages 144, 200, 228, and III, The Empress, page 43). Our Queen of Pentacles is the physical, or material, side of the mother—the aspect that deals with money, property, and practical concerns to make our lives secure.\\n\\nThis Queen looks down upon her golden coin and to the earth itself, Earth being her suit element. All around her are symbols of spring and fertility—the hare, lush vegetation, flowing water, and flowers. The rose briar is also seen on card VIII, Strength, and I, The Magician—which also shares the dominant colors of red and yellow for practicality and clear sightedness. The land is part cultivated and part wild, giving the sense that work is ongoing and that the Queen is comfortable in nature and in the domain of her own garden or yard. She is pragmatic, cares for her environment, and above all, works hard to achieve long-term success. She is patient and will wait to see the fruit of her labor.\\n\\nEngraved on the Queen\\'s throne are pears. Symbols of fertility and long life, pears were sacred to the Italian deity Pomona, goddess of fruit trees and the orchard. According to Ovid, Pomona was a wood nymph—which the Rider-Waite deck\\'s artist, Pamela Colman Smith, may well have referenced in the carving of a nymph on the right of the throne. The goat\\'s head is the symbol for Capricorn, one of the Queen\\'s zodiac signs, mirrored as a winged goat on the crest of her crown. The goat also appears on card XV, The Devil, and is a symbol of excess that, in the case of the Queen of Pentacles, translates as sensuality.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element combination is Water of Earth. As water feeds earth and makes crops grow, this underlines the Queen\\'s association with fertility and plenty.\\n\\nQueens and Kings in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the Queen as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As a person:** The Queen of Pentacles is usually well off, generous, and supportive. She has a strong maternal instinct, is affectionate and wise—and she may be an older woman, or a younger female with wisdom beyond her years. Her vocations include public office, ecology, agriculture, politics, sports coaching, food and catering, and business—any work that benefits large numbers of people. She may be a homemaker, as she loves caring for her home and garden. She likes the good things in life and knows how to spend money well—on beautiful objects, on gifts for loved ones, and of course, on herself. She is physically affectionate and hands-on in her projects; rather than dictating from the sidelines, she will lend practical help.\\n\\nIn readings, she commonly shows up as a benefactor.\\n\\n**As the \"you\" card in a reading:** Care for your body and your finances.\\n\\n**As an influence:** In addition to practical support, wisdom, good financial management, and financial help, the Queen of Pentacles can show marriage and money coming to a couple. It is also a positive card for good health, a sensual sex life, fertility, and children.\\n\\nIf two or more Queens fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Queens: Rivalry\\n* Three Queens: Helpful friends\\n* Four Queens: Women meeting up\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen this card is reversed, finances can suffer. Money you relied upon doesn\\'t roll in or funds are misappropriated. You may have to deal with the impact of someone\\'s financial mishaps. This is temporary, however. An additional meaning is your home is neglected while other concerns take over.\\n\\nAs a person, the reversed Queen can be stubborn and unimaginative. She can be mean with money, or at the other extreme, an emotional spender. Her erratic behavior is for self-comfort, or she uses money to buy other people\\'s affection.\\n\\n# KING OF PENTACLES\\n\\nElement: Air of the suit of Earth\\nAstrological Associations: Aries and Taurus\\nChakras: Solar plexus and base, for wisdom and security\\nKey Meaning: A generous man\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE KING OF PENTACLES\\n\\nThe King of Pentacles is an aspect of card IV, The Emperor, or father archetype, who brings structure, order, and authority. The King of Pentacles is the father-aspect that deals with money, property, and practical concerns to make our lives secure.\\n\\nThe four bulls\\' heads on the King\\'s throne stand for Aries, one of his zodiac signs, and the number four relates to his ancestor card, IV, The Emperor (see page 46), and also symbolizes the four elements. The King has his right foot on the head of a boar to show his mastery over base instincts. His foot and leg are armored, to symbolize he has fought hard for his position. This is echoed in the victory wreath under his crown, which is decorated with red flowers and fleurs-de-lis, three-petaled lilies or irises, ancient Egyptian fertility symbols. In this way, the King presides over the fruits of the Earth—the element of his suit.\\n\\nThe grapes and bull imagery also invite a comparison with the ancient legend of Ampelos, a young satyr loved by the Greek god of wine, Dionysus. Ampelos was savaged by a wild bull and died. Then Dionysus turned Ampelos\\'s corpse into a grapevine and his blood into wine. On the card, vines grow plentifully around the bulls on the throne of the King of Pentacles and creep onto his robes as a pattern of leaves and red grapes—symbols of fruitfulness and success. From this, we deduce that the King plans carefully and expects results from long-term investments.\\n\\nHe holds a scepter in his right hand and his precious coin in his left, which rests on his knee. He is protected by a stone wall, and it seems he is stationed within castle battlements, as we can see the castle keep and towers on the right of the card. We sense he is secure and protected. The background is golden and orange, like his coin, reminiscent of late summer sky and harvest time, a symbol of abundance. The King\\'s cowl is red, for energy and the material world; he does not rest on his laurels.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Air of Earth, which can be interpreted as grounded ideas—the King sees through the projects he begins. Air and Earth can also be thought of as seeds borne on the wind to impregnate the earth, relating to the King\\'s meaning of fertility and foundation for future growth.\\n\\nKings and Queens in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the King as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.\\n\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nAs a person: A visionary man with a plan, the King will work hard for rewards and is usually well off. He is reliable and generous and offers practical support. Security is important to him, and he is happiest in a settled relationship. He needs to be a protector, and he has firm boundaries—he will not tolerate those looking to take what is his. His ideal vocations include property and building, business, accounting or any work that is number-based, as well as agriculture or land management.\\n\\nAn additional meaning is a generous benefactor.\\n\\nAs the \"you\" card in a reading: Make the most of your assets.\\n\\nAs an influence: Financial and property matters improve, and you enjoy success and comfort. The King of Pentacles also predicts conflicts that will be resolved. In relationships, he offers security and loyalty.\\n\\nIf two or more Kings fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Kings: A good partnership\\n* Three Kings: Influential men\\n* Four Kings: A power battle\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the King is greedy and untrustworthy, so double-check all financial agreements to ensure that there are no hidden catches. Debt is an interpretation of the reversed King, so turn the spotlight on your finances now to limit the damage of overspending.\\n\\nAs a person, the reversed King is corrupt and may be involved in fraud or gambling. He is determined to win at any cost.\\n\\n# The Suit of Swords\\n## ACE OF SWORDS\\n\\n**Element:** Air\\n**Astrological Association:** The Air signs—Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius\\n**Number:** 1\\n**Tree of Life Position:** Kether, the sphere of divine light\\n**Key Meanings:** Success, decisions, and beginnings\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE ACE OF SWORDS\\n\\nA hand appears from a cloud, offering an upright sword. Circled with a crown, the image is a symbol for the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Kether, for divine light, also traditionally titled as \"the crown.\" Hanging from the crown are a frond of fern and a sprig of mistletoe and berries. As both plants can attach themselves to trees, the sword here becomes the tree, a symbol of everlasting strength. Above the sword hilt are six golden leaves, similar to those on the Ace of Wands (see page 207). The number six corresponds to Zain, the sixth letter of the Hebrew alphabet; its symbol is the sword. The six also links with card VI, The Lovers, for decisions—the sword\\'s action is nothing other than decisive.\\n\\nThe scene beneath the sword shows blue-and-purple mountains, symbols of spiritual truths and goals. While there are no dwellings or green pastures to muse upon, growth is symbolized on the crown itself, with the mistletoe and fern, signifying the fertility of the mind; the sword therefore offers us the gift of intelligence (linking with the card\\'s element of Air, for the mental realm) and because it is held upright in victory, a second gift of success. As with the other Ace cards and their symbols, in the Ace of Swords, the sword is offered with the right hand, the hand of giving (as opposed to the left hand, which is the receiving hand).\\n\\nAces offer the pure energy of their suits. As number ones, they represent oneness with the divine spirit or God. Indivisible, their energy is singular, strong, and purposeful. They all represent beginnings, impulses, and new possibilities, in the most pure and obvious form. In this Ace, the sword we see is double-edged—in cutting to the truth, it can defend us or turn against us. The sword is certain and strong; A. E. Waite, the creator of the Rider-Waite deck, describes the Ace of Swords as \"the triumph of force.\" As the swords are part of battle, the Ace does not come without potential conflict.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright meaning of the Ace is auspicious for every aspect of your life. In a spread, it overrules any negative minor arcana cards close by (just like the major arcana card XIX, The Sun). The Ace of Swords predicts new beginnings, decisions, and clear thinking and usually relates to work and love. It heralds action, drama, and sometimes confrontation. However the Ace of Swords manifests in your life, it will bring an immediate change to your circumstances—for the better.\\n\\nAs a prediction card, it shows that mental agility and assertiveness will bring success. The other cards around the Ace in a reading will guide you to nature of this conquest. Be cautious, though, not to be too zealous—judge the situation and be direct, rather than abrasive, mindful of how you would want to be treated if you were on the receiving end.\\n\\nIn relationships, it reveals triumph over past obstacles—you win through to your heart\\'s desire.\\n\\nIn a reading, one Ace brings a focus on the life area according to the suit, which can set the theme of the reading. If two or more Aces appear near each other in a reading, it means the following:\\n\\n* Two Aces: An important partnership\\n* Three Aces: Good news\\n* Four Aces: Excitement, beginnings, and potential\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Ace reverses, the card can predict conflict and arguments, and you may become involved in a hurtful battle of wills. The card can also predict a contest that you cannot win, at least at present. The message is to withdraw, tend your wounds, and turn your attentions elsewhere. You may also lack confidence in your intellectual abilities just now and not feel equal to others—which is your perception, not the reality.  Another common meaning of the reversed Ace in readings is a decision going against you, such as failing a test or interview and, in more general terms, not being able to hold your ground under fire from more dominant personalities.\\n\\n# TWO OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air\\nAstrological Association: Moon in Libra\\nNumber: 2\\nTree of Life Position: Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom\\nKey Meanings: Time to think and a stalemate\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE TWO OF SWORDS\\n\\nA lone woman holds two swords across her chest in a pose of self-defense. She appears to be resting from a duel and protects her heart with her weapons, as if fearful that the pain of the Three of Swords, with its pierced heart, may come. Although blindfolded like the maiden on the Eight of Swords, unlike that woman, she has taken herself to a safe space. Seated on high ground, this is her place of contemplation. Her pale robe is monastic in style, which tell us she is taking time out from the world and keeping her thoughts to herself. The rocks, partly submerged, symbolize issues yet to surface fully; but they do exist—they are part of her landscape and will not go away. Her hair is parted so that the third eye, between the brows, is visible. Temporarily deprived of sight, she \"sees\" with her intuition. The sky, graduating from gray to twilight blue, reflects a changing emotional landscape: She is in two minds, also signified by the two swords.\\n\\nThe figure\\'s position—facing us, sitting squarely on a stone plinth, and holding swords—reminds us of card IX, Justice. Traditional representations of Justice in art and sculpture show this virtue personified as a blindfolded female holding the sword of justice in one hand and the scales of mercy in the other. Similarly, our Two of Swords woman must also adjudicate, but in the sphere of her own affairs.\\n\\nThe card\\'s Tree of Life sphere is Chockmah, which means wisdom and links with the figure\\'s exposed third eye. She must use her knowledge and experience to make the right decision, to choose between two possibilities. There\\'s a further duality in the Tree of Life and the card\\'s astrological associations. Chockmah represents the male principle, or yang, as opposed to the yin, or feminine qualities of the Moon in the card\\'s astrological profile of the Moon in Libra. The moon, celestial body of the subconscious, joins balanced Libra. This combination reveals a tendency to keep the peace rather than act. We see a crescent moon on this Two of Swords, which echoes the moon on card II, The High Priestess, the psychic who symbolizes the divine feminine.\\n\\nThe waxing moon we see on the top right of the card is in its growth phase and will change shape throughout its cycle, just as our blindfolded woman goes through the process of decision-making, weighing up alternative outcomes.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Two of Swords shows thinking time before a decision. A situation has reached a stalemate, so you can view this period as a truce or a rest before further negotiation. The tendency is to protect yourself, have a little peace, and not take action. Unfortunately, this upcoming battle may not go away; resolve it now and it\\'s done. Otherwise, the situation festers and may return.\\n\\nAs there are two swords on the card, this Two can reveal a person you cross swords with. It\\'s likely that your difficult person is sharp-tongued, but don\\'t be afraid of a lashing: Stand your ground and say what you think.\\n\\nThe card commonly comes up in readings to show employment issues and also time out in relationships. This may be circumstantial, due to partners living in different places; if negative cards such as the Three of Swords or Lovers reversed appears with the Two of Swords, it shows making a decision about the future of a relationship.\\n\\nWhatever your experience of the Two of Swords, help is at hand in the form of supportive friends and colleagues. Listen to advice and then take the best practical steps forward.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the traditional meaning of the Two of Swords is deception and being blind to someone\\'s manipulation. This card applies particularly to partnerships—love, friendships, and in business and your career. If you intuition is telling you that someone is dishonest, pay attention and carry out your own detailed investigation to get to the heart of the matter. There is an opportunity here to act, but the timing is sensitive; the message is not to delay.\\n\\n# THREE OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air\\nAstrological Association: Saturn in Libra\\nNumber: 3\\nTree of Life Position: Binah, the sphere of understanding\\nKey Meanings: Sorrow, heartbreak, and pain\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE THREE OF SWORDS\\n\\nThe Three of Swords shows clouds, rain, and three swords plunged into a heart—to the left, to the right, and through the center. The heart is large and the swords smaller, and the effect is that of a heraldic shield, a defensive device that has been penetrated. The rain echoes the action of the swords, like headless arrows striking through the gray sky. What is unexpected in this sad card is the subtle blue sheen on the lower parts of the sword shafts, which appear at the bottom of the heart motif. Blue stands for truth—and the swords pierce to the truth, whatever the situation; in cruelty lies some kindness. Perhaps, after all is said and done, a blue sky awaits, a brighter outlook for the future.\\n\\nThis is one of two minor arcana cards without people (the other is the Eight of Wands), so there is no obvious action to interpret. This is intentional, in that the sole focus is the impact of the swords, giving the cards its primary meaning of pain. As creator of this deck A. E. Waite says, the card represents \"all that the design signifies naturally, being too simple and obvious to call for specific enumeration.\"\\n\\nSwords are of the suit of Air, but here we are dealing with emotional pain, so there is an element of Cups or Water for emotions here too. The swords lend drama to the situation, but the pain is very much in the heart rather than the head. The card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Binah, means understanding and compassion and represents the female principle of reception. In this sense, there is little we can do but accept the pain and surrender to it.\\n\\nIn numerology, three is a dynamic number (see also card III, The Empress, page 42). It symbolizes the trinity of mind, body, and soul—which, unfortunately, may all be affected when we experience deep disappointment or betrayal. The three can also be interpreted as three people in a relationship, which gives the card one of its meanings of affairs. This reflects old versions of major arcana card III, The Lovers (see The Historical Lovers, page 56), in which three people were shown on the card; a man had to choose between two lovers, hence once of its meanings of decisions and affairs of the heart.\\n\\nThe Three of Swords has an astrological association with Saturn in Libra. Saturn\\'s influence is harsh and demands the truth, whereas Libra likes balance, like the sign\\'s symbols of the scales. However, Saturn is more powerful in this combination, so the truth will come out—no matter how much it hurts. In the card\\'s image, the swords cut right through to the heart of the matter.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright meaning of the Three of Swords is direct in its meaning and reveals the pain of truth. The clouds of doubt are cleared, and you can do nothing but face reality. This is a common card for relationship betrayal and can denote affairs or disloyalty in other life areas, such as work relationships and business dealings. On a more positive note, you do get right to the heart of the matter—any confusion is banished, and you are now in a position to begin to move on from shock, to begin the healing process and move forward.\\n\\nIn health, this Three can relate to heart issues that may need attention—such as blood pressure issues, circulatory problems, conditions such as agina, and very occasionally, the need for surgery. Please note that this is a message to take care of the heart and safeguard health; it is not a prediction of serious illness.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Three of Swords reverses, the upset of the upright card is accompanied by quarrels and drama. In a sense, despite the upheaval, this gives a more positive meaning than that of the upright card, as at least feelings are expressed and some of the confusion and pain is shared and released. Those around you will understand your need to vent.\\n\\n# FOUR OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air\\nAstrological Association: Jupiter in Libra\\nNumber: 4\\nTree of Life Position: Chesed, the sphere of love\\nKey Meanings: Rest, passivity, and quiet time\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE FOUR OF SWORDS\\n\\nExisting as it does between the Three, the card of strife, and the Five, the \"battle\" card, the Four of Swords offers welcome rest: an opportunity to recover from the stress and betrayal of the Three before the onslaught of the Five. The knight shown in this card has temporarily laid down his tools; one sword is displayed lengthwise, the hilt aligning with his head, in the sculpture as part of the tomb, to signify his identity as a warrior. The other three swords hang above him, secured on the wall, ready for him to take up when he rises. But for now, the knight is at rest, safe from attack and the demands of assault.\\n\\nThe stained-glass window symbolizes the world being held at a distance during the knight\\'s period of withdrawal. The figures in the stained glass suggest a monk helping a child or devotee, embodying the medieval knight\\'s commitment to charity. This is echoed in the knight\\'s code of chivalry, which commits \"to give succor to widows and orphans,\" and hints at the two beggars on the Five of Pentacles (see page 156) who are also depicted below a stained-glass window, another world they cannot see and are not part of.\\n\\nThe stone knight is similar to those in the twelfth-century Templar Church in London, which was built by the Knights Templar, an order of charitable knights in the Middle Ages who were powerful protectors of Christianity. The knight on the card could be Baron Robert de Roos (1177–1226/27), as the hands of his effigy at Templar Church, unlike the other eight effigies displayed there, are placed in prayer position like those of the knight on the Four of Swords. De Roos took a year out to become a monk and relinquished his lands, so the monk depicted in the stained-glass window may also in fact be De Roos himself.\\n\\nNumber four is the number of stability and balance. In the warring suit of Swords, it denotes ceasefire; there is no need to continue a conflict. In the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the card links with Chesed, the sphere of love. This is love in the broadest sense, encompassing gentleness, harmony, and peace—just what the resting knight needs.\\n\\nAstrologically, the Four of Swords is linked to the planet Jupiter in the sign of Libra. Jupiter indicates philosophy and possible solitude. Libra, however, is a sociable sign, so we have the conflicting qualities of the lone thinker with the socialite. In this way, perhaps the astrological association tells a story of the knight stepping away from his comrades to spend time at rest in contemplation, taking on the life of a monk in the church in which he takes sanctuary.\\n\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Four of Swords has the meaning of time out, so you may be taking a rest from work, a personal project, or a relationship. The card often comes up in readings in the past or present position to show taking a break from a relationship and also the need for recovery from illness or an operation. Commonly, as a prediction card, the Four of Swords shows recovery from stress, so the message is to conserve your energy and take quiet time if you can. The solitude of the Four of Swords can also apply to meditators and lightworkers and any individual following a spiritual path. You may need more mental space and private time than usual, so in this sense, the card is a nudge to take some alone to recharge. An additional meaning of the card is counseling or therapy and, rarely, attending a memorial service.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Four of Swords reverses, the time-out message is enforced—so you may have to take time away from work or other responsibilities due to influences out of your control. Unfortunately, there is little you can do to alter this situation, so you must surrender to events. This is a phase, and the message is to find peace. Use the time positively. You may need to rethink your working arrangements or come to terms with changes in a relationship, particularly if you live apart from a partner or potential love.\\n\\n# FIVE OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air\\nAstrological Association: Venus in Aquarius\\nNumber: 5\\nTree of Life Position: Geburah, the sphere of power\\nKey Meanings: Upheaval, conflict, and loss\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE OF SWORDS\\n\\nThe Five of Swords shows a young man holding three swords, two hoisted proudly at his shoulder and one held downward, by the hilt, as if to stake his territory. Two swords are cast down on the beach, surrendered by the retreating figures. Rather than having dignity in victory, however, the young man appears to be grinning, perhaps taking sadistic pleasure in his opponents\\' defeat. The defeated figures have their backs to us, unable to face their challenger again, and the one on the right has his hands to his face in shame. The clouds tell the story of the conflict that has just ended—they are gray and slashed, like torn fabric.\\n\\nThe youth wears red, for energy and vitality, and green, the color of nature. First, this tells us about his personality: Red reflects his energy and ego, and green, his sense of natural entitlement—not just to take his challengers\\' weapons, but to enjoy their humiliation. The green can also symbolize his greenness in the ways of the world. He is yet to learn the karmic lesson of \"what goes around, comes around.\" Second, if we see ourselves as the victims, we can interpret the red and green as symbols of growth and the wisdom gained from the experience of conflict. This also links with the card\\'s number, five, the number of mankind and our physical experience on the earth plane. Five is also the quintessence, or fifth element in alchemy. In the Five of Swords, the quintessence is experience or what we gain from the aftermath of battle. This is symbolized on the card by the blue sky behind the slashed clouds and the calm waters of the sea: The storm is abating.\\n\\nOn the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Geburah, or power, which means conflict and judgment—in this Five of Swords, it reveals the need for power and control, the impetus behind the battle. Geburah is ruled by the planet Mars, known as the war-bringer.\\n\\nThe astrological association of Venus in Aquarius gives the meaning of idealism, one of Aquarius\\'s attributes, with sensitive, romantic Venus; one interpretation is unconventional choices; it may also reveal a clash of fantasy and pragmatism. This is reflected in the card\\'s upright meaning to retreat when battle is done, rather than continue to fight in a war that cannot be won.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe traditional meaning of this Five of Swords is battle and loss. It often shows family disputes, conflicts with managers, and also being the victim of \"the system\"—specifically, educational boards and government and educational bodies. In relationships, the card predicts tension and conflict. Overall, the Five of Swords reveals ongoing stress, continual challenges to your position—and, often, defeat.\\n\\nHowever this disruptive Five of Swords manifests for you, the overriding message is that all is not lost. You may not win the battle, but you can recover and walk away with your self-respect—provided you make a gracious exit at the right time. There\\'s a danger here that you continue the fight even when the battle is over. Regardless of the provocation, deal with your anger and disappointment. There\\'s a saying, \"It\\'s all over, bar the shouting.\" Don\\'t keep shouting too much longer or hope to revisit the situation or relationship. It\\'s done.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe Five of Swords reversed shows unnecessary conflict; you could become caught in the middle of another person\\'s fight, and you may be the injured party through no fault of your own. This battle is not for good reason. Whoever initiates it has a selfish agenda; this person may be trying to cover up his or her incompetence at work, blaming others to deflect attention; equally, the drama may be due to ego and a need to make a show of power. In this sense, it can be easier to extricate yourself because you know the battle is less personal.\\n\\nAn additional meaning of the card is bullying and oppression. There is no shame in this—rather, the card suggests finding an opportunity to expose the unfairness and to shift the balance of power.\\n\\n# SIX OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air\\nAstrological Association: Mercury in Aquarius\\nNumber: 6\\nTree of Life Sphere: Tiphareth, the sphere of beauty and rebirth\\nKey Meaning: Moving on\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE SIX OF SWORDS\\n\\nThe Six of Swords is one of the more positive Swords cards, along with the winning Ace (see page 176) and the peaceful Four (see page 184). In this card, there are battles, blindfolds, or stress: A ferryman is steering a boat to a promising destination with gentle hills and trees. We see the water on the right of the boat is choppy, whereas the water before him is calm. The troubled water symbolizes a rough situation he is moving away from and the still waters ahead, a period of serenity away from strife.\\n\\nHe is accompanied by two passengers, a child and a shrouded figure, perhaps the child\\'s mother. All three figures face away from us, suggesting they are fixed on their destination; the decision to leave has been made, and the journey has begun. This determined focus is a feature of the card\\'s astrological association, Mercury in Aquarius, which also suggests a rational approach that is in keeping with Swords, the suit of the mind. The card\\'s gray sky is neutral, so there is no emotion here; the ferryman is a neutral actor, too, paid for his services without any attachment to the outcome. The card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Tiphareth, means beauty and rebirth, offering a happy new beginning for the ferryman\\'s passengers. One further aspect to note is the traditional role of the male ferryman as active and the female passenger as passive. The presence of male yang and female yin energy in balance suggests peace and harmony, which chimes with the card\\'s numerological association.\\n\\nThe number six stands for serenity and peace. The six-pointed Star of David comprises two triangles, representing the concept of heaven on earth—a reminder that we can realize the heavenly and spiritual aspects of ourselves in our daily lives to enjoy harmony in mind, body, and spirit. In the Six of Swords, the two themes are the present and the future. The challenge is to integrate our experiences and move forward.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Six of Swords shows you moving on from a situation or relationship and enjoying a period of peace and harmony. This may manifest mentally rather than physically, as you take a more detached approach, distancing yourself from drama and complication. This gives you an opportunity to rest and recharge; it may lead you to explore a new environment or make a spiritual discovery.\\n\\nIn work, the card can show travel as part of your role (and respite from the office or other workplace), and in relationships, the card commonly shows two people spending time apart. More negatively, the interpretation is a relationship ending (look for accompanying cards such as the Three of Swords or the revised VI, The Lovers, for validation). This ending may be positive or negative, depending on your situation.\\n\\nOn a more literal note, the card can simply show taking a break from work or your usual environment, and you may travel, possibly on a trip overseas. When the Six of Swords appears with major arcana cards VII, The Chariot, for progress and XIII, Death, for transition, a more permanent move is suggested, so the combination can be interpreted as emigration or a long period of travel. If we see the three figures on the card as a family rather than ferryman and passengers, the card suggests a major move for two or more people.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Six of Swords has a meaning that is similar to that of the upright card. It reveals a need to escape, but your plans are delayed. It may not be the right time for you to travel or leave an unsatisfying situation, as certain problems need to be addressed and resolved before you can be free. However, check that your intentions are sound and that you\\'re looking in the right direction; rather than fixating on a particular outcome, which may blind you to other possibilities, keep your plans realistic. You may feel frustrated now by lack of progress, but stay focused and grounded and your time will come.\\n\\n# SEVEN OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air\\nAstrological Association: Moon in Aquarius\\nNumber: 7\\nTree of Life Position: Netzach, the sphere of endurance, instinct, and desire\\nKey Meanings: Theft and dishonesty\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE SEVEN OF SWORDS\\n\\nA smug thief makes off with five of seven swords while an encampment is unguarded. The inhabitants are silhouettes, engrossed elsewhere while their weapons are stolen. This seems an easy take—the tent doors are open, and their bright colors make them attractive to the passerby. The thief knows he is safe with his hoard and gives a sarcastic smile as he looks back at the site, knowing full well he will not be discovered. The card\\'s bright yellow background symbolizes consciousness, so this thief does not operate in secret under cover of night. He commits daylight robbery.\\n\\nHis dress is ostentatious. His red, fur-trimmed boots and matching hat give the impression of someone with a sense of entitlement to the best things life has to offer—except, he is willing to possess them by illegal means. The red symbolizes energy, ego, and the material world. Red on his feet suggests he will act on his ego to get what he wants. Note how his boots and hat don\\'t fit with the rest of his outfit; perhaps they are stolen, too, as they make a sharp contrast with his everyday leggings and basic drawstring shirt, the clothes of the common man—or common thief.\\n\\nOne question remains, however. Why does the thief leave two swords behind? The two remaining swords highlight one of the positive meanings of the card, in that the victims may still defend themselves, even when their opponent has the advantage. The thief takes with him just five swords. Five in the minor arcana is also the number of upheaval—the Five of Swords, conflict; the Five of Pentacles, money issues; the Five of Wands, challenges; and the Five of Cups, loss.\\n\\nThe card\\'s Tree of Life sphere is Netzach, which means endurance and instinct. These are the qualities the potential victim will need to uncover the identity of the thief; they are also the personality of the thief himself, in his willingness to take risks. He is also able to wait patiently for the right moment to strike. Further qualities are revealed by the astrological association of the Seven of Swords with the Moon in Aquarius, which blends the Moon\\'s intuition with Aquarius\\'s idealism and detachment.\\n\\nThe number seven is a mystical number. It was sacred to the god Apollo, founder of the famous Delphic oracle, and is the number of the days of the week, the deadly sins, and the wonders of the world (see Understanding The Chariot, page 58). Seven represents possibilities, as it comprises three, the number of heaven, and four, the number of earth, and so shows the potential to bring heaven down to earth—to manifest an ideal. However, in the Seven of Swords, the\\tthief’s\\tidea\\tof\\theaven\\ton\\tearth\\thas\\tmoral\\timplications.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe common name for this Seven of Swords is “the thief.” Traditionally, the message is to protect your belongings and property. In general, we can think of this as a potential transgression—you may encounter a challenge to your position, an individual invading your space, or in relationships, a selfish partner who takes too much emotionally, or at worst, defrauds you. As the suit of Swords relates to intellect, you\\'ll need your instincts and your wits to discover the truth. You may need to be devious and play this person at his or her own game, too, to find out what you need to know. Your opponent may be strong, but you still have valuable resources on your side. The card can also show legal problems, and unfair or fraudulent business dealings.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe reversed Seven of Swords shows a tendency to give up rather than take a stand. It may feel unnatural to you to think like your opponent to anticipate their next moves, but this attitude will help you defend what is yours. Otherwise, you may surrender too soon. This particularly applies to work, when a colleague tries to disempower you. It\\'s important to stand your ground. As with the upright card, the reversed Seven of Swords can show legal problems of and in business dealings, beware of unscrupulous people.\\n\\n# EIGHT OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air\\nAstrological Association: Jupiter in Gemini\\nNumber: 8\\nTree of Life Position: Hod, the sphere of majesty and the mind\\nKey Meaning: Restriction\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE EIGHT OF SWORDS\\n\\nThe Eight of Swords shows a fairytale gone bad: A maiden is outcast from a castle, and her hands are bound. She stands alone within a semicircle of planted swords, with her back turned to her home. A hostage, she is a symbol of otherness, separated from the castle, which stands for civilization and inclusion. Her red robes symbolize energy, but she is tied, so her movements are restricted. The rock pools look pretty and innocuous, but if she cannot shift her position soon, she may be in danger when the water rises with the high tide. Her eyes are blindfolded, symbolizing an inability to see a way ahead. A blindfolded woman also features on the Two of Swords, the \"stalemate\" card—so perhaps the hostage of the Eight of Swords was once the Two, but now her bonds are tighter and her situation more precarious.\\n\\nThankfully, this bondage will not last: A. E. Waite, the Rider-Waite tarot\\'s creator, says, \"it is rather a card of temporary durance than of irretrievable bondage.\" At some point, our maiden will muster the determination to save herself; no prince on a white charger will come.\\n\\nThe astrological association of this Eight of Swords is expansive Jupiter in sociable Gemini, a highly creative and intellectual combination. The challenge is to manage information overload, as ideas can go too far, leading to potential failure due to a lack of perspective and focus—a link with the blindfolded hostage, the card\\'s central image.\\n\\nThe card\\'s number is eight, and one of its meanings is change, renewal, and stability. This reflects the hostage\\'s need to extricate herself from thoughts that are keeping her trapped and to find new ground. As Swords are the suit of Air, which rules the mind, this also links with card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Hod. Its common meaning is majesty, and in this Eight of Swords, refers to the mastery of the mind.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright card shows feeling trapped. This may be due to a series of bad experiences and poor luck, and you begin to wonder if things can ever improve. You may be anxious due to an unsatisfactory bond with an individual or an organization; specifically, you may be trapped by a credit agreement that leaves you little money for yourself.\\n\\nThis unfortunate Eight of Swords commonly reveals problems in careers and the intellectual or mental realm, showing frustration and, at its most extreme panic. Hemmed in and unhappy, you may be finding it impossible to do your work to your satisfaction due to unreasonable demands or disorganized management. Also, there may be a sense of conversations going on behind closed doors that you are not party to, so you feel isolated and even vulnerable. The card commonly arises in readings to show someone who is in a role that doesn\\'t suit them, but they are under pressure to conform—such as working in the family business or taking a course because it will lead to a profession, although it isn\\'t what they love doing at all. Many creatives and lightworkers go through this experience of not fitting in, but it takes time and confidence to find your path. You can release yourself from these bonds, but it will take determination, and you may need to swallow your pride and ask others for support and advice. On a social level, the Eight of Swords can show you feeling humiliated or ignored, and you fear others’ attitudes toward you. An additional meaning of the card is illness and incapacity. Again, this does not imply permanent disability, but a phase of physical restriction.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nIn the reversed position, much of the upright meaning applies, except that it is often accompanied by strong emotions such as guilt, anger, and regret. It’s likely you’ll express these feelings in negative ways, however, because you are so frustrated; try not to lash out on whoever is closest. As with all the minor arcana cards, the Eight of Swords shows a phase that will not last.\\n\\n# NINE OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air\\nAstrological Association: Mars in Gemini\\nNumber: 9\\nTree of Life Position: Yesod, the sphere of foundation and the unconscious mind\\nKey Meaning: Anxiety\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE NINE OF SWORDS\\n\\nThe meaning of the Nine of Swords, like many of the cards of the suit, is obvious at first glance. An anguished figure sits upright in bed, awake in the night in clear distress. Nine horizontal swords appear behind and above the figure, like bars at a window. Swords represent the intellect and thoughts, here en masse as a symbol of restriction; their hilts are crossing, crowding the space like unwanted thoughts. The third sword from the bottom crosses the crown of his head, oppressing him; the second sword from bottom strikes through his head; and the lowest sword appears to cut through the area of his heart. What began in the mind now hurts him at a deep level, and he is cut off from usual sources of comfort in a painful internal struggle.\\n\\nThe mattress is a pale purple color, the color of intuition, linking with the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere Yesod, which is ruled by the Moon, ruler of the unconscious mind. The pastoral scene carved on the side of the bed or couch is suggestive of dreams, but the two figures depicted are not at peace; there is an aggressive current to the image. A figure is brandishing an implement at a prone figure, indicating that the dreamer is a victim of his thoughts.\\n\\nIn contrast to the dark feel of the card, the quilt is bright and beautiful, showing the twelve glyphs of the zodiac signs with alternating patches of red roses. The glyphs represent multitude—rather than having any individual significance, they tell us that the person\\'s worry may encompass lots of life aspects. The red roses are a symbol of love and hope. The dreamer cannot see this just now, as his hands are covering his eyes, much like the two beggars on the Five of Pentacles, who cannot see the money tree depicted in the beautiful stained-glass window about them.\\n\\nThe card\\'s number is nine, or three sets of three. Three is a dynamic number, and when multiplied by itself, symbolizes intense productivity—however, in the suit of Swords, the mind is overproductive, awash with worries and negative thoughts.\\n\\nThe astrological association, Mars and Gemini, is a forceful combination. Free-spirited Gemini is controlled by Mars, an unstoppable, aggressive force, bringing frustration and a sense of entrapment.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nI call this Nine \"the 3 a.m. card\" because it describes the meaning so accurately: It\\'s what you wake up worrying about in the small hours of the night, showing you are dealing with high levels of anxiety. You may have suffered an illness and the resulting low energy or a shock or a buildup of minor stresses that begin to disrupt your sleep patterns and peace of mind. External events such as these may have triggered the initial stress, but the issue now is how you are responding to it.\\n\\nLook to the surrounding cards to see the life area that this relates to, although the anxiety in the Nine of Swords can reflect unhappiness in key areas, from work to relationships, coloring your usually positive attitude. The card also indicates the habit of worry—so you may be worrying about inconsequential things that usually don\\'t warrant your attention. Thankfully, as this is a minor card, this pattern is temporary.\\n\\nIn work, the Nine of Swords can show feeling overwhelmed. You simply have too much to do, particularly if the card appears with the Ten of Wands, known as the burden card.\\n\\nThe Nine of Swords occasionally comes up in a reading to show mental health issues associated with anxiety, such as panic disorder or anxiety and depression. Insomnia and nightmares are additional interpretations.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nUnfortunately, as you might expect, the reversed Nine\\'s meaning is more extreme than that of its upright counterpart and traditionally means despair, guilt, or feeling trapped. However, this is the lowest point of the cycle, and these feeling will begin to shift. As you gradually move out of this difficult phase, you will feel more able to turn these feelings of powerlessness around. Be patient and compassionate with yourself and turn to others for support rather than suffering alone.\\n\\n# TEN OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air\\nAstrological Association: Mercury in Virgo\\nNumber: 10\\nTree of Life Position: Malkuth, the Kingdom, the sphere of experience\\nKey Meaning: Endings\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE TEN OF SWORDS\\n\\nThe Ten of Swords has a black background that appears on the Nine of Swords (known as the stress card) and card XV, The Devil. We are indeed in a dark place again here, as we see a young man pinned to the ground by ten swords embedded along the length of his back. There\\'s also a sense of shock in the card, symbolized by the blue water, purple mountains, and yellow sky set against charcoal-gray clouds, heavy with rain, in a black sky. This dual skyscape represents two worlds: the bright outlook of the \"before-world\" prior to the conflict and the \"after-world,\" in which everything is changed and a sudden darkness descends like a shroud, to eventually cover the body. The victim is facedown and does not show his face, as if he is no longer relevant; the focus of the card is the points of the swords. The victim\\'s right hand is slightly twisted, and if we look closely, we see it makes the sign of blessing, with the first two fingers straight as in card V, The Hierophant (see page 50). In this sense, we may interpret the figure as a fallen master or guru; or this pose may be a sign of the man\\'s acceptance of this ending—that what has befallen him is in fact a blessing. A red cloth is draped over him, and the fabric flows like blood from his body. Red symbolizes love, vitality, and, here, the life force, or blood.\\n\\nIn numerology, ten represents completeness and perfection. In the Ten of Swords, the completeness is an ending. The individual sphere associated with this card is Malkuth, for kingdom—so the Ten of Swords reveals an end to our personal kingdom or one aspect of our material world.\\n\\nThis card\\'s astrological association of the Sun in Gemini brings a bright, sociable influence that is at odds with the card\\'s meaning and can only highlight newfound happiness after the influence of this dark card has passed. As the sun goes down on a life phase, the Sun in Gemini offers light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe traditional meaning of the upright card is ruin. While this sounds frightening, it does not, however, mean death or destruction; it is also worth bearing in mind that this event, although sudden, has a history. This is not an act of God, like the lightning strike of card XVI, The Tower, but the natural outcome of a culmination of events that leads to inevitable change. This ending clears the way for new possibilities, and you may find the finality of it releases you from frustration and stress, as is expressed in the preceding card, the Nine of Swords (see page 192). In this sense, the Ten of Swords is an aspect of card XIII, Death, in its meaning of endings, transition, and new beginnings. In your personal life, bonds of friendship may break, and there may be no turning back; this, unfortunately, is unavoidable, but with hindsight, you may see that certain people in a group were causing discord and stress. In love relationships, the card signifies a dramatic ending (particularly if it appears close to the Three of Cups, the \"sorrow\" card). However, the Ten of Swords often applies to a group of people, rather than individuals. In work, this may manifest as the closure of a department accompanied by job loss or a failing business. On a more positive note, this is the end of an era; soon the strife and upset will be over. Health issues, such as low energy and exhaustion, will improve.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Ten of Swords holds the meaning of the upright card, but indicates there may be more repercussions. You may examine your past actions and feel guilty or angry and react more deeply to the fallout; try not to hold on to the stress. Accept the situation and let go. The reversed Ten of Swords can also show feeling helpless, particularly if you have been ill or overwhelmed emotionally. Soon you will feel able to pick yourself up and start over.\\n\\n# PAGE OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Earth of the suit of Air\\nKey Meanings: Intelligence and contracts\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE PAGE OF SWORDS\\n\\nA young man stands strong, sword raised in both hands and alert to the signs of trouble. The landscape is blown with clouds, and we see a lone tree almost doubled over by the wind. A circling flock of black birds suggests something is about to take flight or take form. Whatever happens, though, our hero is poised for action in unsettled times. On high ground, he has chosen the best position to fend off any enemy. He stands tall for all to see and brandishes his sword. The weapon is a symbol of his intention and his mind, which extends beyond the edge of the card itself. He is willing to deal with known and unknown threats, to plan his response and ultimately to win. While not dressed for battle—he has no armor and possibly no experience of conflict—his pose suggests he is ready to attack or defend; looking over his right shoulder away from his sword, he is alert to attack. He minds his position on both sides, a knight in training—his tunic is dark red, a regal color, symbolizing his ambition to rise through the ranks. His boots are red, for energy and matter, while his hose and sleeves are yellow, a symbol of the intellect.\\n\\nThe mountains beyond are blue, a color commonly used in this tarot to denote truth and spirituality (think card II, The High Priestess, and her robes, or VII, The Chariot, and its heavenly canopy of stars). Like card XI, Justice, this Page with his sword cuts to the truth, bringing clarity: The clouds disappear. Young, feisty, and confident, the Page of Swords is clear-thinking and dedicated to his cause. His element is Earth of Air. His foremost skill is his intellect and wit, so when combined with practical Earth, he is a strategist, planning the most effective action to take. The negative aspect of this Earth-Air pairing is conflict between Air\\'s need to show off and Earth\\'s pragmatism. If Air dominates, the Page of Swords can be precocious and superficial, losing sight of the bigger picture.\\n\\nPages and Knights in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Page in a reading by working with the card\\'s imagery first, then the written interpretations (see also the Introduction, page 8).\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nAs an influence: This card denotes useful information. Your hard work pays off in business and other work dealings. The Page of Swords also suggests people around you will be helpful, furthering your ambitions. This is a time to be alert and observe carefully what others say. Be ready to take action as you as you see the right opportunity and consult others who can act as advocates on your behalf. This card often comes up in readings to say that a contract will be coming your way–regarding property, careers, travel documents, and other agreements.\\n\\n## As a person:\\n\\nThe Page of Swords suggests an individual who is charming, clever, and very good company. As he\\'s a Page, this is often a younger person or someone with a youthful, quick-fire brain. He may be forthright with his words, but he is ultimately a good ally who can turn challenges into opportunities. Quick to learn, he is curious and open, but the downside is that he can be mischievous and so set on achieving his aims he forgets to treat others with sensitivity.\\n\\n## As the \"you\" card in a reading:\\n\\nRely on your intelligence.\\n\\n## As an influence:\\n\\nIf two or more Pages fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* **Two Pages:** Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed\\n* **Three Pages:** Lots of social activities\\n* **Four Pages:** A social group of young people\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, this clever Page of Swords becomes manipulative and cunning. Be cautious about information you receive now, as it may not be reliable, and be discerning about what you hear about other people, as it may be unjust and even slanderous. As a person, the reversed Page of Swords can be a gossip who seems to care little about the misconceptions he spreads. At his worst, he can be devious and unscrupulous. Ignore his needs for constant attention; don\\'t fuel his fire.\\n\\n# KNIGHT OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Fire of Air\\nAstrological Associations: Taurus and Gemini\\nKey Meanings: Stress and truth\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE KNIGHT OF SWORDS\\n\\nSuch is the force of the Knight of Swords that even his horse seems on the brink of terror as they leap toward an unseen enemy. The Knight, in full battle armor, is on the brink of war, his sword brandished, horse\\'s reins held high, and feet forced down into the stirrups to urge the animal to keep pace. His visor is up, showing us that he is more than ready to look his enemy in the eye. The wind is against him—the trees to the left of the card bend to the right while our rider gallops to the left—a sign that he is not afraid to ride toward, not from, whatever opposes him. The desert landscape is rather bleak, a symbol for the need to survive, and the clouds are ragged, as if the Knight had sliced them to pieces. His sword extends beyond the card, like that of the Page of Swords, to suggest that this Knight\\'s intention goes far beyond the limited landscape we see. Fixated on his mission, it feels as if nothing can stop him. The \"true blue\" of his armor and horse bridle and collar show he is prepared to cut to the heart of the enemy—or matter—at hand.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Fire of the suit of Air. Fire, or passionate energy, is symbolized by his red cape and plume, and Air is denoted by the birds and butterflies decorating the horse\\'s collar. The mix of air, or wind, with fire, or lightning, suggests thunderstorms and hurricanes—a surge of power that erupts then dissipates. This is the Knight\\'s modus operandi. He charges, confronts the enemy, and then departs in a flash.\\n\\nKnights and Pages in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Knight in a reading by working with the card\\'s imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As an influence:** Unpredictable, tempestuous times are ahead—you\\'re in for a roller coaster drama of highs and lows. Sudden truths may come to light or underlying conflicts are exposed. This may be illuminating, stressful, or bewildering, depending on your position.\\n\\nThe card often comes up to show disputes at work and tension within families and in romantic relationships. While you may not be responsible for the cause of the trouble, what counts now is how you recover. There is a way forward, but you may need to wait until the situation is calmer before you can make a move.\\n\\nAs a person: The Knight of Swords is determined and driven, and he has a strong sense of himself and his mission. He may be quirky and entertaining with an offbeat sense of humor, and he may even dress in a distinctive way. Incisive, forthright, and intelligent, he makes a strong advocate and is prepared to fight for his beliefs. The downside is that he often makes his mark, gets bored, and moves on. In relationships, he may cause drama, but takes no responsibility for reconciliation, leaving others to make peace while he\\'s charging ahead with his next obsession. In work, he can show up in readings to represent auditors and other assessors, such as doctors and lawyers, or consultants who are hired to fire, not fix—in short, professionals who are adept at diagnoses and whose opinions matter. Ultimately, though, you are the one who will have to deal with the outcomes.\\n\\nAs the \"you\" card in a reading: Expect the unexpected.\\n\\nAs an influence: If two or more Knights fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Knights: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed\\n* Three Knights: Men meeting up\\n* Four Knights: Lots of action; events speed up\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the King of Swords means stressful situations are blown out of proportion as an individual thrives on drama but lacks the courage to take control. The card also advises that you may be let down by someone you thought was reliable and steadfast. A person with a big personality may have lots to say but have little substance. However, this individual\\'s high intelligence means he usually talks his way out of trouble, denying any involvement.\\n\\n# QUEEN OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Water of the suit of Air\\nAstrological Associations: Virgo and Libra\\nChakras: Crown and third eye, for openness and intuition\\nKey Meaning: An incisive woman\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE QUEEN OF SWORDS\\n\\nThe Queen of Swords is an aspect of card III, The Empress, or mother archetype. This Queen is the \"mind\" aspect of the mother, just as the Queen of Cups is the heart (see page 144 and The Empress, page 42).\\n\\nOur Swords Queen has a sense of sovereignty like no other—she is the only female monarch shown in profile, like a head on a coin. One hand is raised, as if to greet a visitor, and like the Queen of Wands, her pose is alert. This is a woman in charge: She holds her sword at a perfect right angle to her throne arm and sits on high ground, giving a sense of authority over her domain.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Water of Air. We see the Water element in the river below four trees; it extends from the Queen\\'s red veil, which flows down behind her throne. This creates the effect of a river of blood, a reminder that this Queen, unlike her jewelry, is not for show. If necessary, she will fight, and it won\\'t be pretty.\\n\\nThe Air element, for the mind, is expressed through motifs of winged creatures—the single bird, the cherub, and the butterflies on her throne and crown. Her butterfly crown is open, a sign that she welcomes ideas and opinions. She is very much part of her airy landscape, wearing clouds on her cloak and white, billowing robes. The blue-sky background symbolizes her motivation to find the truth.\\n\\nOn her throne are two crescents: either two crescent moons or two sickles, or curved blades. As moons, they link her to the crescents on card II, The High Priestess, who deals with the hidden world of the subconscious and the sixth sense: The Queen of Swords also has sharp instincts and is not afraid to follow them. As sickles, they echo the purpose of her magical object, the sword, again linking with her element of Air.\\n\\nQueens and Kings in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the Queen as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As a person:** An astute strategist, the Queen of Swords is single-minded and highly ambitious. Like her sign of Libra, she can quickly assess all aspects of a situation to get to the truth, including the underlying psychological motivation for others\\' attitudes and actions. Adept at numbers, she may be an administrator, IT specialist, researcher, or financial executive—the need for attention to detail relates to her associated sign of Virgo. Sword Queens also make successful businesswomen or bosses. She has much life experience and may have had hurdles to overcome in her early years. This makes her the strong woman she is. For all this, she is still willing to take risks on new experiences and relationships. She does not suffer fools gladly, but if she likes you, she will reward and trust you implicitly.\\n\\nTraditionally, this card is known as the widow, but means in general a single woman or a woman who has to make her own way in the world. It\\'s also a common card for single parents.\\n\\n**As the \"you\" card in a reading:** Be determined and stand strong.\\n\\n**As an influence:** The Queen of Swords offers wisdom and intelligence, perspective, and the ability to see the bigger picture. When placed closed to negative cards in a reading, the Queen shows strength in adversity.\\n\\nIf two or more Queens fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Queens: Rivalry\\n* Three Queens: Helpful friends\\n* Four Queens: Women meeting up\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nReversed, the Queen of Swords suggests excuses for bad behavior or a situation in which you are unjustly attacked. As a person, this individual can be an opponent or someone who has suddenly turned bitter and vengeful. However, a common reason for the Queen to invert can be extreme stress—this woman lacks awareness of just how unreasonable her demands have become. If this is the case, back away; she must help herself.\\n\\n# KING OF SWORDS\\n\\nElement: Air of the suit of Air\\nAstrological Association: Capricorn and Aquarius\\nChakras: Crown and third eye, for openness and intuition\\nKey Meaning: An ambitious man\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE KING OF SWORDS\\n\\nThe King of Swords can be considered as an aspect of card IV, The Emperor, or a father archetype who brings structure, order, and authority. The realm of the King of Swords is the mind, just as the King of Cups rules the heart, the King of Pentacles, the physical body, and the King of Wands, the soul (see pages 146, 174, 230, and The Emperor, page 46).\\n\\nThe King is comfortable in his regal position and resembles card XI, Justice, in his pose with Justice\\'s sword (see page 74). Like his partner, the Queen of Swords, the King\\'s throne is engraved with butterfly motifs, for his element of Air. On the right—almost perching on the King\\'s shoulder—is a female fairy. The two crescents forming a crest with the butterflies at the top of the throne may be sickles, another implement that cuts like his sword. Equally, they could be two moons. One of the moons of Uranus, the planet of awakening that rules the King\\'s sign of Aquarius, is named Titania, after the legendary queen of the fairies. If the fairy on the throne is intended to be the beautiful but cruel Titania, she embodies the dark and light sides of the King\\'s mighty sword: This charming sovereign can be ruthless.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Air of Air, so this King is idealistic and ambitious. His throne is placed above the base of the trees, suggesting perspective from a high position. His sword is held at an angle, rather than in upright, ceremonial pose, so we sense he is familiar with the feel of its swipe. The clouds, symbols of doubt or confusion, seem banished to the mid-and lower parts of the card, as if the King had just cut through the clouds above him, revealing a soft bluish sky. Blue is the color of truth and clarity, echoed in the color of his robes.\\n\\nThe King\\'s purple cloak stands for intuition, and the red cap and orange sleeves are for passion and the material world. He focuses his sharp mind on what needs to be done.\\n\\nKings and Queens in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life, or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the King as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As a person:** The King of Swords can be an intellectual or a man who relies on logic to help him win. He is also open to ideas, although he can be impatient if he has to wait for a consensus before taking action. However, he is outwardly calm and makes good judgments. He often has a dry sense of humor and is very charming. In readings, he can appear as a seductive man you meet at work or through other professional connections.\\n\\nHis ideal vocations include traditional professions, and you will often find him in powerful roles: doctor, judge, solicitor, or member of the armed forces or law enforcement; academic, IT, and research work may appeal, and in business, he is often a manager or director. Whatever profession he chooses, he must be able to make decisions that make a difference, and preferably, have hands-on involvement.\\n\\n**As the \"you\" card in a reading:** Take charge.\\n\\n**As an influence:** When the King of Swords arrives in a reading, the focus is on the mind rather than the heart. You may be going through an intensive time of work or study. In relationships and domestic affairs, it\\'s time to take the initiative.\\n\\nIf two or more Kings fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Kings: A good partnership\\n* Three Kings: Influential men\\n* Four Kings: A power battle\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the influence of the usually balanced King of Swords can be destructive. You may be put under unreasonable pressure to produce results. Unfortunately, there\\'s no room for argument or personal interpretations, so you may feel oppressed. Thankfully, this is a temporary situation. As a person, you may be dealing with someone who plays mind games and who will do almost anything to win.\\n\\n# ACE OF WANDS\\n\\nThe Suit of Wands\\n\\n**Element:** Fire\\n**Astrological Associations:** The Fire signs—Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius\\n**Number:** 1\\n**Tree of Life Position:** Kether, the sphere of divine light\\n**Key Meanings:** Enterprise, career, travel, and beginnings\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE ACE OF WANDS\\n\\nA hand, offering a single wand, appears from a cloud. The Ace of Wands is the only card of the suit to show multiple buds, symbolizing new ventures. There are four leaves on one stem, and the two lower stems each have three leaves. A further eight leaves float around the wand, giving a total of eighteen. This may relate to the eighteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Tzaddi, meaning hope. The leaves are similar in appearance to the droplets on the Ace of Cups; the Ace of Swords; XVI, The Tower; and XVIII, The Moon (see pages 120, 176, 94, and 102).\\n\\nThe scene below shows purple mountains, symbols of spiritual goals. A building, a fairytale castle or a monastery, is perched on a hill—signifying the ambition to attain a dream or spiritual aspiration. The castle is isolated and protected by high walls and a tower. Seeing the strong wand grasped before us, we may view it as a club, held high in a gesture of protection and ownership of the land. In the valley, pure water flows, the blue a color for true purpose. Three trees grow on the right bank, symbols of growth and fertility.\\n\\nUnlike the cultivated garden of the Ace of Pentacles, the landscape of the Ace of Wands is natural and untamed: This Ace is a true pioneer, venturing into wild new territory. In this sense, the card presents the gift of enterprise and adventure. As with the other Ace cards and their symbols, the offering is made with the right hand, the wand held with the hand of giving (as opposed to the left hand, which is the receiving hand).\\n\\nThe second gift of the Ace of Wands is the drive to succeed. We may have an enticing vision or prospect, but need the energy to make it happen. The card\\'s element is Fire, full of burning purpose—just as the wand, if planted, will determinedly grow into a tall, strong tree. The card\\'s Tree of Life sphere is Kether, for the divine light of God, or great spirit. In the Ace of Wands, this stands for the spirit of adventure.\\n\\nThe Aces offer the pure energy of their suits. As number ones, they represent oneness with the divine spirit or God. Indivisible, their energy is singular, strong, and purposeful. They all represent beginnings, impulses, and new possibilities, in the most pure and obvious form.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright meaning of the Ace of Wands is auspicious for every aspect of your life. In a spread, it overrules any negative minor arcana cards close by (just like the major arcana card XIX, The Sun). The Ace predicts new beginnings, enterprise, and invention and often relates to work issues and projects. It\\'s a happy card for creative work, too. With this Ace, you experience a flash of inspiration and know what do next to give form to your concept. As you conceive ideas, so the card works at a literal level as a phallic symbol, for male virility and starting a family. An additional meaning of the card is travel and adventure, particularly when it appears in a reading with the Three or Eight of Wands (see pages 208 and 218).\\n\\nIn a reading, one Ace brings a focus on the life area according to the suit, which can set the theme of the reading. If two or more Aces appear near each other in a reading, it means the following:\\n\\n* Two Aces: An important partnership\\n* Three Aces: Good news\\n* Four Aces: Excitement, beginnings, and potential\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Ace of Wands reverses, it can show blocks to creative projects and delays to travel. In work, a project may be abandoned or postponed due to poor management. In general, the card reveals false starts; plans need a rethink. In relationships, this Ace can reveal a lack of commitment from a man or time apart for a couple, usually due to work, and the woman finds herself waiting for the man.\\n\\nAnother common meaning of the reversed Ace of Wands in readings is difficulty conceiving a child, particularly if the card appears close to the Three of Swords, the card for sorrow (see page 180).\\n\\n# TWO OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Fire\\nAstrological Association: Mars in Aries\\nNumber: 2\\nTree of Life Position: Chockmah, the sphere of wisdom\\nKey Meanings: Plans, partnership, and influence\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE TWO OF WANDS\\n\\nIn the Two of Wands, a young man holds a globe in his right hand and a wand in his left hand. The wand is held toward its base, and the man rests it on a raised section of wall so that it stands taller than his head. Altogether, these symbols offer us the meaning of extension, of looking beyond the immediate vicinity and into the future. Positioned at the top of a castle, this is a man with a view: purple mountains for goals and intuition, a peaceful lake and sandy shore, and, rising into the hills, modest dwellings, forests, and fields. This feels like fertile land, where ideas and dreams are nurtured. Our hero has plans, and they are beginning to grow, just like the leaves budding from the two wands. He stands partly in profile, rather than facing us, gazing into his globe. The two wands on each side of our hero and the card\\'s Roman number, II, create a portal, a doorway to another realm of experience, and soon the man will be ready to step into it. This links with his Tree of Life sphere, Chockmah, for wisdom. His red robe and hat signify vitality and the material world.\\n\\nThe man on the Two of Wands already knows he is partway toward his dream, and he has gained confidence through the work he has already done. This is shown by the wand on the right on the card, which stands on the ground, lower than the wand he holds. A small ribbon is tied at the base, perhaps as a seal, to signify that this wand, or part of his project, is complete. On the plinth at the left is the intriguing emblem of a black cross with red-and-white flowers: roses for passion, lilies for purity, and the cross for faith. (The saltire, or St. Andrew\\'s cross, is also depicted on the Six of Cups.) Roses on a cross can signify the Rosicrucian order, a secret esoteric brotherhood that took the Rosy Cross as its symbol. A principal text of Rosicrucianism is the fifteenth-century allegory *The Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosenkreutz*, which features a rose cross and a magical castle. On our Two of Wands, both the castle wall and cross may be an intentional reference to Rosicrucianism, as this order also influenced Freemasonry; the Rider-Waite\\'s creator, A. E. Waite, was a mason, and so familiar with this alchemical image. Note, too, the cross and roses design in stone on the Three of Pentacles (see page 152).\\n\\nAstrologically, this card is linked with Mars in Aries, a fiery pairing that signifies willpower and energy. The challenge is to temper the fire when necessary and resist impatience.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n\\nThe Two of Wands shows you making plans and moving forward, so travel arrangements are one meaning of the card. In your work, you are gaining influence and proving your worth. In return, you receive good support and advice. The card can also show new creative partnerships and beginning a new project or enterprise.\\n\\nAs there are two wands on the card, there are also two aspects to your situation. Consider what helps you on your path and any issues that hold you back. Make a plan that maximizes your strengths so your talent continues to shine.\\n\\nAn additional meaning of the Two of Wands is a new romantic partnership, and it often comes up in a reading to reveal that the relationship begins at work or through a mutual friendship or leisure interests. Spiritually, too, you are feeling more connected within yourself and the world at large, so you may feel drawn to development courses or simply spending time connecting with nature. Overall, great opportunities are on the way, allowing you to move up a level. Make the most of these offers—your star is rising.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, your talent may be wasted because those who can help you progress are not listening. If this is the case, consider a change of scenery. You need to be with people who understand your views and appreciate your skills. The card can also show misplaced trust and an unreliable partner. Check if those close to you are pulling their weight—or you could be the one doing all the work. In relationships, a partner is unreliable.\\n\\n# THREE OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Fire\\nAstrological Association: Sun in Aries\\nNumber: 3\\nTree of Life Position: Binah, the sphere of understanding\\nKey Meanings: Action and adventure\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE THREE OF WANDS\\n\\nFor one time only in the tarot sequence, we see a figure with no visible face. Whereas on the Two of Wands the man is in part profile, in the Three he has turned his back on us entirely. He has stepped down from the protection of his castle and now stands on higher ground right above a bay, where he has planted three wands firmly in the land, one of which he also holds. The two wands behind him offer protection; the third one he leans on, giving him support. He has passed through the portal of two wands and taken a step closer into the scene we saw at a distance in card Two. Now, our adventurer\\'s cloak is a more vibrant red, for energy; he sports green, the color of nature and fertility, and wears a thin headband like card I, The Magician (page 34), symbolizing the mind—and his willpower to succeed. In this card, the man\\'s headband looks as if it is waiting for a Roman victory wreath, the honor given to a homecoming hero. This theme continues with the checkered throw that sits over his left shoulder, Roman style; the pattern is reminiscent of flags used to signal the start and end of races, traditionally taken as a trophy by the champion. With headband and throw, the figure on the Three is already signaling that he is one of life\\'s winners.\\n\\nAstrologically, the Three of Wands is linked with the Sun in the sign of Aries. This indicates passion, strong communication, and clear goals. The potential issue with super-solar Aries is impatience, but that\\'s because Ariens simply want results. This action-driven influence is softened by the meaning of the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, Binah, for understanding and the receptive feminine principle.\\n\\nDynamic number three, number of growth and change, is shown in three boats, three wands, and three buds on each wand, reinforcing the card\\'s meaning of productivity—this is work in progress. The boats are pointing away from the shore, so we sense that this young man is an entrepreneur who has just launched his first fleet of three, carrying valuable cargo to a new destination. The vessels are symbols of the beginning of his journey toward distant shores and his future goals.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Three of Wands is one of the tarot\\'s good-fortune cards. It reveals successful enterprise and seeing your projects and relationships thrive; it is also a great indicator for weddings and a new, important relationship. It predicts a busy, intense period of activity—so be prepared to be inundated with texts, emails, calls, and visitors. This card is often an indicator of an imminent trip away and seeing your plans realized—whether those are travel plans, business plans, a wedding, or other projects you have nurtured. This is also a time for great communication and self-expression through chosen interests such as art, music, crafts, and sport. The Three of Wands also favors individuality and nonconformism, so you may feel drawn to unconventional people and projects now. Also, pride yourself on your quirks and eccentricities, and let others see all you have to offer rather than the aspects of you with which you assume they are most comfortable. From this, you can gain even more confidence and even admiration. You are unique, after all. The Three\\'s challenge is to keep the balance between staying focused on the prize while remaining patient, calm, and in the now. Appreciate, too, those people who are around you now; try to make time for friends who don\\'t immediately fit into your future plans.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Three of Wands shows communication problems. Plans are delayed and it may be difficult to make progress in your projects. Relationships can suffer under this influence, as you find it hard to express yourself and understand what others are saying. Misunderstandings may make you feel needlessly isolated. If this applies to you, resist the frustration that this influence brings and go with a slower pace for a while. Overall, however, these are minor negatives; this is still a card of good fortune, even when reversed, so don\\'t let glitches become a distraction. You can still succeed.\\n\\n# FOUR OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Fire\\nAstrological Association: Venus in Aries\\nNumber: 4\\nTree of Life Position: Chesed, the sphere of love\\nKey Meanings: Freedom, creativity, and domestic happiness\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE FOUR OF WANDS\\n\\nOne of the happiest cards of the tarot\\'s minor arcana, the Four of Wands shows celebration. A couple stands triumphant, holding up bouquets of flowers. Four wands make an arbor hanging with garlands of ripe fruit—lemons, apples, plums, purple grapevines, and pink blooms. Three tiny figures are dancing, outside the walls of a city. This scene might depict harvest time, a public holiday, or even a wedding. The inspiration for the card may draw upon two pagan festivals—Beltane, or May Day, if we see the wands as maypoles, and Lammas, the Celtic celebration of the first day of the harvest. May Day, held on May 1, has its origins in the Celtic festival of Beltane, which celebrated the coming of spring and the end of seed-planting. Maypoles—tall wands—were raised in villages, where the people danced around them to honor fertility. A May Queen and King were crowned with flowers—much like the couple on the Four of Wands, who, dressed in Roman-style robes, echo the origins of the celebration as the Roman holiday of Florlia, or festival of flowers. The bright-yellow background of the card signifies solar energy, the power of the sun to make all life grow. It also symbolizes consciousness, in that the couple present themselves for all to see in public celebration. They wear blue and red robes, for truth and passion and the material world, respectively. The dominant red and yellow are similar to the colors of card I, The Magician, with his luminous yellow background, rose briars, and red robes, for the energy to manifest his desires. Strength, card VIII, has a similar palette, again for vitality and also, acting with conscious awareness. Number four is the number of stability and balance. In the passionate suit of wands, it denotes security, shown by the protective walls of the castle, and celebration. In the kabbalistic Tree of Life (see page 234), the card links with Chesed, the sphere of love—which is why this card is often referred to as \"the honeymoon.\" Astrologically, the Four of Wands is linked to the planet Venus in the sign of Aries. This indicates passion, spontaneity, and joie de vivre. Aries, however, can be dominating at times, which can make love too intense or driven.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThis lovely card reveals success after completion—a time for reward. Socially, you will have the opportunity to celebrate and really enjoy yourself; the card predicts you will be brimming with confidence and full of vitality. You also establish yourself in your work and at home, completing a building or remodeling project or moving to a larger property. The vibe of the card is putting down roots, just like the wands. People around you note your willingness to be a pillar of the community and involve yourself in local issues and social events. In work, your talent is appreciated, and you are full of ideas and enthusiasm. Spiritually, the card shows that you share your light with others.  This often comes up in readings to predict that a new partner or love interest will open their hearts and express love and affection. It is also known as the honeymoon card—literally, or as a time to celebrate, run free, and enjoy what life has to offer. It is auspicious for creativity, and artistic projects flourish under the uplifting influence of the Four of Wands.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, this is one of the few minor arcana cards that retains its positive meaning, albeit with minor irritations. You don\\'t get all the time you need to focus on doing what you love—from traveling to creative projects and socializing—and you may experience some disruption to plans. In this position, you might just be feeling invisible and not heard. However, if you are feeling too much like the outsider, consider if your environment is right—it\\'s likely that it\\'s them, not you. Overall, however, this unsettled phase will soon pass as the sunny aspect of the upright card prevails.\\n\\n# FIVE OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Fire\\nAstrological Association: Saturn in Leo\\nNumber: 5\\nTree of Life Position: Geburah, the sphere of power\\nKey Meanings: Competition and debates\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE OF WANDS\\n\\nThe Five of Wands shows five young men at odds with one another, holding a wand, a symbol of the ego and passion, which links with the card\\'s element of Fire. They all have their own take on a situation, and because they are not acting in harmony as a group, they appear to be getting nowhere. Each is absorbed in his own game: one stands victorious, holding up his wand in triumph; a group of three crosses wands; and a fifth holds his wand over his shoulder, trying to keep it for himself.\\n\\nThese individuals can be seen as the pages of the four minor arcana suits, which approach this contest of strength in different ways. The victorious youth in brown and the youth in green, right in the center of the fight, are fiery Pages of Wands; the youth in blue, holding tight to his prize and showing he can lift its weight, the Page of Pentacles; the aggressor in red, the Page of Swords; and the passive youth in blue and white, defending himself, the Page of Cups. On the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the sphere associated with this card is Geburah, or power—here, the youths make a show of their power, but to no great effect. No one will get hurt; as the Rider-Waite\\'s creator, A. E. Waite, says, \"This is mimic warfare\" and \"a sham fight.\"\\n\\nThe twelve total buds growing from the wands symbolize budding ideas. The number twelve relates to Lamed, the twelfth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which originally meant to goad—its pictogram represents a staff, or wand.\\n\\nFive is the number of mankind, as well as of the quintessence, or fifth element in alchemy. In the Five of Wands, this suggests that despite ongoing disorder, order can at some point be restored. Like the quintessence, the solution may be invisible now, but it is possible. The chaos will calm, as the next card in the suit sequence is the six, the number of harmony, and the meaning of that card is victory (see page 214).\\n\\nThe card\\'s astrological association of Saturn in Leo presents a conflict—Leo\\'s heady highs and need to show off do not sit easily with the disciplinarian planet Saturn. In the Five of Wands, this brings a sense of frustration, like a fire trying to stay alight despite lashings of rain.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe traditional meaning of this Five of Wands is competition, and the message is to hold your position, rather than compromise. Unlike the Five of Swords, this card does not predict outright battle, but there will be fiery opinions and a lack of agreement, at least for now. Misunderstandings abound, particularly in work matters. You may find yourself in meetings during which everyone is talking at once, defending their position rather than reaching a consensus; it\\'s a fight just to be heard. Scheduling problems and delays to travel plans are an additional meaning, so double-check travel documents and emails, appointments, accounts, and agendas; pay close attention to any written documents. The Five of Wands often comes up in readings to show being surrounded by people with strong opinions, particularly in families; in education, it predicts that you will need to compete hard in tests or examinations—but you can succeed. On a lighter note, the card can also show competitions that are important to you, such as sporting events.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe reversed meaning of the Five of Wands is deception and misinformation. You may be mislead, so carefully consider the source of messages before you make assumptions; what you hear may be exaggerated or untrue. In its most negative aspect, the card can show dishonesty. In general, the Five of Wands can show you feeling stressed and in a weak position, and if so, it is better to keep your own counsel just for now, or at least be highly selective about the people you choose to trust. An additional meaning of the card is litigation.\\n\\n# SIX OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Fire\\nAstrological Association: Jupiter in Leo\\nNumber: 6\\nTree of Life Position: Tiphareth, the sphere of beauty and rebirth\\nKey Meaning: Victory\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE SIX OF WANDS\\n\\nA young man on a white charger parades in triumph, wearing a laurel wreath, the Roman symbol of victory and power, echoed by the wreath tied to his wand. The wand through the wreath is a symbol of fertility, of hopes coming to fruition, echoed in the horse\\'s green caparison, the color of nature and new life. The steed is white, for purity of intention. The spectators carry five wands; they might be the five sparring youths from the Five of Wands, now holding their wands upright and orderly, focusing on celebrating the homecoming hero. One of the youths is facing away from us, as if standing guard over the procession, to show that the rider\\'s victory is protected and cannot be challenged.\\n\\nThe horseman can also be seen as an important messenger, bringing great news. The youths may be footmen, making way for the rider on his course to deliver his message to royals or other dignitaries. He has his horse on a tight rein, to show that he has his element, Fire, under control. He may be exuberant, but there is a calmness in his victory that is gracious and stately. This attitude of dignity links with the card\\'s number, six, which stands for harmony and passivity. Six also has the meaning of the past creating the present and future, so we might also assume that the rider\\'s past efforts have been rewarded, which makes for a glowing future.\\n\\nThe Tree of Life sphere associated with this card is Tiphareth, which means beauty and rebirth, which can be interpreted as relating to beauty, or grace, in victory. The card\\'s astrological association of Jupiter in Leo highlights leadership and innovation, and reveals resilience—the ability to overcome minor obstacles and develop a bigger and higher perspective, which is symbolized by the laurel wreath set high on the rider\\'s tall wand.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThis card signifies deserved success. The Six of Wands is a very welcome card if you have been struggling recently and feeling unsure if your hard work will finally pay off. The card often relates to work, career, and projects and can show promotion and a new contract or bid; it can also reveal that an outstanding legal matter will go in your favor. Enjoy this happy time and don\\'t be afraid to share your accomplishment; others will support and applaud you. It\\'s time to bask in glory, be self-satisfied, and make space to celebrate, regardless of how busy you may be.\\n\\nIn personal relationships, the card shows that feelings are declared—and will be well received. The card can also indicate a proposal when it appears close to emotion cards such as the Ace of Cups, Two of Cups, Ten of Cups, and the major arcana card VI, The Lovers (see pages 120, 122, 138, and 24). This explains the additional meaning of the Six of Wands for celebrations, such weddings or attending parties and degree ceremonies. A traditional meaning of the card is good news, which can relate to any life aspect—love, property, education and work, and decision-making. Look to the other cards that appear close to the Six of Wands in a reading to determine the nature of the news on the way.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nUnfortunately, when the Six of Wands reverses, the reward you have hoped for doesn\\'t materialize when you need it to. But all is not lost—this is a card of delay rather than cancellation, so hold fast to your goals. The wait for news may be frustrating, but this is due to circumstances beyond your control rather than a reflection on your abilities. The message is to be as patient as you can, and distract yourself with other tasks (rather than check your emails and text messages every five minutes). The card can also show you being let down by others, which dints your confidence. However, as with all the tarot\\'s minor arcana cards, this is a passing phase, so try not to take such disappointments to heart. An additional interpretation is pride, which in the reversed position can reveal an arrogant, self-important individual.\\n\\n# SEVEN OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Earth\\nAstrological Association: Mars in Leo\\nNumber: 7\\nTree of Life Position: Netzach, the sphere of endurance, instinct, and desire\\nKey Meanings: Courage, effort, and challenges\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE SEVEN OF WANDS\\n\\nThe scale of this card is curious—a singular young man dwarfs the landscape at his feet. He is giant-sized, rather like Jonathan Swift\\'s Gulliver in Lilliput, the island of tiny people who ask for Gulliver\\'s help and then seek to punish him when he will not obey their immoral commands. Towering over the small land of hills and the river below, the youth of this Seven of Wands is certainly out of place.\\n\\nWith both hands on the wand, he uses everything in his power to defend his position. Due to his size, he sees the bigger picture, and he has great ideas, symbolized by the five buds on his wand compared with the groups of two and three buds on the six wands before him. His effort is all for a good purpose—he is dressed in green, the color of nature, to symbolize growth, and his hose is orange, the color of his suit element, Fire. He is very sure of his territory, standing astride a river; his position and intentions are clear. Six other wands rise up toward him, but he is ready for the challenge.\\n\\nThe card\\'s astrological association, Mars in Leo, brings together the warlike planet, Mars, with exuberant Leo, creating an unstoppable force. Leo the lion is also depicted in major arcana card VIII, Strength, one of the ancestor cards of the Seven of Wands (see Strength\\'s Reflections at VIII, Strength, on page 62). Netzach, the card\\'s Tree of Life sphere, stands for endurance, which the youth needs to avoid letting his fiery ambition burn out. The twenty total buds on the seven wands can be linked with the Hebrew letter Resh, which means success. Victory is within his grasp.\\n\\nThe card\\'s number is the mystical number seven. Seven comprises three, the number of heaven, and four, the number of earth, so the challenge is to bring heaven down to earth—to make your dreams reality (see VII, The Chariot, page 58). In the Seven of Wands, this reward comes from negotiation and courage—standing your ground.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Seven of Wands reveals obstacles in your path, but you will keep going and overcome them. Success is in reach. The card is particularly relevant to work and career matters and highlights all negotiations; regardless of how difficult the conversation becomes, there\\'s a need to keep talking and stay in conversation until you are satisfied with the outcome. You will need to stand tall, and by being very clear on your position, you can win.\\n\\nThere\\'s a noble aspect, too, about this card, and it often comes up in a reading to show you may be defending others, not just your own interests. In this sense, the Seven of Wands is the card of the advocate, and you may find you need to stand up for those who are not able to speak for themselves. Morality is important to you now, so the Seven of Wands shows you may become the spokesperson for a group—such as a committee or jury. The task isn\\'t an easy one, but you will persist.\\n\\nIn relationships, there are hurdles, and you may need to fight for love. This can be only temporary, however, so by all means stand up for your relationship in the short-term, provided you are sure your partner will return your loyalty.\\n\\n## REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Seven of Wands can indicate that you doubt your purpose. You may struggle to be heard and may have to overcome constant obstacles—but now it\\'s unclear if it\\'s all going to be worthwhile. As a result, the card can show anxiety and hesitation. An additional meaning is feeling overwhelmed with continual problems, particularly if this Seven appears with the \"burden\" card, the Ten of Wands. If so, the message here is to focus on the areas where you can still make a difference, while accepting the things you cannot change. This applies to relationships, too, so ask which imperfections you can live with and which aspects—such as your partner\\'s attitude or circumstances—are nonnegotiable.\\n\\n# EIGHT OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Fire\\nAstrological Association: Mercury in Sagittarius\\nNumber: 8\\nTree of Life Position: Hod, the sphere of majesty and the mind\\nKey Meanings: News and travel\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE EIGHT OF WANDS\\n\\nThe Eight of Wands shows eight wands, all with green buds, flying through a gray and blue sky. The scene below is very similar to that in the Ace of Wands—a small white dwelling on a hill with green hills and a river below. This is one of two minor arcana cards without people (the other is the Three of Swords), so there is no obvious action to interpret. This is intentional, in that the sole focus is the flight of the wands, giving the card its primary meaning of movement. Simply, we see a flight of wands, ripe with green leaves of potential, over a calm landscape. They may be carrying messages, like carrier pigeons, perhaps fixed to the lower part of the wands that are not visible in the image; perhaps they are spears or love\\'s arrows about to land. However we view these magical wands, all events are about to speed up. The wand motifs take up most of the card\\'s space, dominating everything below.\\n\\nThe card\\'s astrological association is Mercury in Sagittarius. Sagittarius, the sign of exploration, combines with Mercury, the winged messenger, to give the meaning of dynamic movement and travel. An additional quality is perspective and insight—just what we need if we are to effectively deal with this Eight\\'s fast and varied demands. The card\\'s Tree of Life sphere is Hod, which relates to the power of the mind: Creative thinking, logic, and a sharp wit are called for.\\n\\nThe card\\'s number is eight, which stands for both stability and renewal (see also card VIII, Strength, page 62). The eights in the minor arcana, as they are near the end of the numbered sequences, hold all our experiences up to that point. We have past knowledge to draw upon, which gives us wisdom and enables new choices—to make new contacts and find a fresh direction.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nAlong with the Ace, the Eight of Wands is one of the most positive cards of the suit. It brings lots of communication, so you may be inundated with emails, calls, and exciting offers. If you have felt held back, or stuck waiting for decisions, you will soon have positive news. All your projects grow wings, moving swiftly forward. Just be prepared for the shift; fast, frantic events will energize you, but you will also need to prioritize any offers. Don\\'t feel you have to say yes to everything. Choose wisely and enjoy this frenetic, exciting influence.\\n\\nIn relationships, the Eight of Wands can bring great news about love, particularly if you have been separated from a partner recently or are waiting to hear\\tfrom\\ta\\tpotential\\tpartner.\\tYou\\tmay\\tbe\\ttraveling\\tsoon\\tto\\tsee\\tone\\tanother. Additionally,\\tthe\\tcard\\thas\\toften\\tcome\\tup\\tin\\treadings\\tto\\tshow\\tthe\\tprofessions of\\tcarpentry\\tand\\tscaffolding—work\\tthat\\tinvolves\\tusing\\tor\\tbuilding\\ta\\tframework\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the simple meaning of the card is delay. You may have lots of pending work to finish and may be waiting for a particular decision that will unblock other ambitions, but just for now, you\\'ll need to be patient. It\\'s also important to be discreet about any grievances you have just now.\\n\\nIn relationships, you may be finding it hard to communicate and as a result be drawn into petty arguments. If you have hopes for a new love, you may be feeling disappointed by the person\\'s lack of contact. Look to the surrounding cards for indictors as to what this means; negative cards such as the Three or Ten of Swords or The Lovers reversed (see pages 180, 194, and 54) suggest that this potential relationship may not get off the ground. More positive cards, such as the upright Lovers or the Ace, Two, Six, Nine, or Ten of Cups (see pages 54, 120, 122, 136, and 138), say that there is still hope you\\'ll connect again.\\n\\nAn additional meaning of the reversed card is jealousy.\\n\\n# NINE OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Fire\\nAstrological Association: Moon in Sagittarius\\nNumber: 9\\nTree of Life Position: Yesod, the sphere of foundation and the unconscious mind\\nKey Meanings: Defense and strength\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE NINE OF WANDS\\n\\nA wounded man is on the lookout. Among eight protective wands, symbols of his resources and responsibilities, he holds a ninth tightly with both hands, like a weapon. The other eight wands are orderly, as if standing at attention, ready for any eventuality. He has positioned himself on a man-made platform, which relates to his Tree of Life sphere, Yesod, or foundation. He has a solid base from which to operate. The platform also sets our would-be warrior away from the green hills behind him; he needs to be a little detached from society so he can better see the approach of potential opponents. And physically, this defender is not to be taken lightly. With his powerful build, he symbolizes strength and endurance; from experience, he has learned to expect challenges to his position, and his past battles are symbolized by the bandage worn around his head. This injury doesn\\'t deter him, and he almost wears it like a bandana, with pride.\\n\\nThe card\\'s astrological association, Moon in Sagittarius, shows great resilience and strength of character—it combines the sensitive mind, the Moon, with the Sagittarian qualities of directness, perception, and the willingness to take risks. This combination may also reveal a need to explore hidden factors, to dig deep to get to the truth.\\n\\nThe card\\'s number is nine, comprising three sets of three. Three is a dynamic number, and when multiplied by itself, symbolizes intense productivity. It also holds the threes as a symbol of the integration of mind, body, and spirit. In the Nine of Wands, all the wands of the previous suit cards accumulate. This reflects the wisdom of experience, but also the responsibility of accrued demands and pressure that is expressed in card Ten, \"the burden.\" By keeping his wands in order in the Nine, the inevitable buildup of untenable demands expressed in the Ten can be avoided.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright Nine of Wands shows that you are in a very strong position. You have fought long and hard to get where you are, and have endured heavy challenges, particularly in work. Being constantly vigilant and ingenious can be exhausting, however, so use your energy wisely; plan all activities meticulously and don\\'t overexert yourself, and you will have all the resources you need to see you through. Thankfully, as with all minor arcana cards, this influence will not last forever. You won\\'t always need to defend yourself to this degree, or make so many sacrifices. This card also highlights the fine balance between being adequately defended and being defensive. While it\\'s appropriate to establish and protect your boundaries, defensiveness keeps you in a negative mind-set; the Nine often comes up in a reading to show a person who is fearful that his or her idea or other work will be stolen—but this is just a perception rather than reality. It can also show an unwillingness to hand in an assignment or to make your work public in some other way due to fear of rejection or criticism. If so, it\\'s time to let go—you have worked hard, and your efforts will meet with appreciation and support.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Nine of Wands is reversed, you endure strong opposition, which seems unfair. You put in hard work—but receive little thanks in return. You give your all, but it still doesn\\'t seem to be enough, so you may be at the mercy of an unreasonable boss or demanding children, friends, or clients. This situation is demotivating, so you become fixed on getting through tasks without enjoying the aspects of your work that used to be satisfying. Equally, you could be the one who is obstinate and inflexible in your attitude.\\n\\nThe reversed card can also show issues with boundaries. Someone may be invading your territory. In relationships, you may be dealing with an individual who is acting defensively because you are veering into uncomfortable territory for them.\\n\\n# TEN OF WANDS\\n\\n!Image of a tarot card with a person carrying a bundle of wands\\n\\nElement: Fire\\nAstrological Association: Saturn in Sagittarius\\nNumber: 10\\nTree of Life Position: Malkuth, the Kingdom, the sphere of experience\\nKey Meanings: Responsibilities and a burden\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE TEN OF WANDS\\n\\nA blond man is striding toward a house he can\\'t see. He knows it is there—perhaps he has visited before, which might explain his confident step. There\\'s an element of desperation here, too: Why would he choose to be so uncomfortable and sightless on his journey? He even chooses to hold his wands so his right hand is in front of his eyes, further blocking the view. Perhaps he sees himself as less than human, a blind beast desperate to release its burden. The man\\'s determination to arrive at his destination is symbolized by his orange tunic, representing his suit\\'s element of Fire, for passion and energy. And the destination looks worthwhile: We see fertile lands, with rolling hills, trees, and a field ploughed and ready for planting—maybe his ten wands will grow there into strong trees. To the right is a manor house, symbolizing that hard work now will pay off in the future if our laborer can endure the load and keep going. This links with the card\\'s astrological association of Saturn in Sagittarius; Sagittarius\\'s need for freedom and travel is eclipsed by the dour taskmaster planet, Saturn. In this sense, the Ten of Wands suggests the struggle between grinding work and keeping our dreams alive.\\n\\nIn numerology, the number ten represents completeness and perfection. In the Ten of Wands, however, the impact of ten wands of Fire is exhausting, both emotionally and financially. The individual sphere associated with this card is Malkuth, for kingdom—so the Ten of Wands in this sense suggests taking on the whole kingdom, or world, which can be both a burden and a burning ambition.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright Ten of Wands reveals that you are carrying too much on your shoulders just now. You may have become so used to being overloaded that you\\'ve lost sight of the reason you\\'re doing the work. It\\'s a common card for homemakers and entrepreneurs, those of you who must multitask and constantly respond to a wide range of demands. Consider saying no to any future requests and decide which projects or jobs you can stop or hand over to someone else. There\\'s a real need here for delegation and support from others. No one expects you to carry this on your own, and this goes for emotional burdens, too—they need to be shared. The card can also suggest that you may be carrying issues from the past. On a more positive note, the card reveals that you can be successful, albeit with careful management of time and resources.  This card can show up in a reading to reveal that you may need to look for less demanding work, but you feel too drained by your present job to spend time searching. This puts you in a catch-22: The situation can\\'t change until you pull back from current responsibilities and invest what energy you possess into changing your circumstances. The Ten of Wands can also show that relationships are neglected because all your attention is on work. Also note that if the Ten of Wands comes up as the you/situation card in a reading, you or the person you are reading for may not be receptive to the reading simply because too much is going on. Lay the cards again or wait three days.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the card\\'s meaning is very similar to that of the upright card, except that some of the burdens may be more perceived than real. This may be a sign of ongoing stress, where every task gets framed as a potential problem. The message here is to try to lighten up a little and take some of the pressure off yourself—you don\\'t need to be perfect. Obstinacy is one of the card\\'s meanings, so do ask yourself if you have created too much self-pressure, fixating on impossible goals.\\n\\nThe reversed card can also show you being caught in an exhausting grind between work and domestic commitments because you are trying to keep everyone happy. Make a vow to make some space for your own needs—you need to please yourself, too. When you can do this, you\\'ll see the way ahead more clearly.\\n\\n# PAGE OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Earth of the suit of Fire\\nKey Meanings: Good news and communication\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE PAGE OF WANDS\\n\\nThe Page of Wands is looking upward toward the top of his wand, out of which are growing tiny leaf buds. The red plume on his hat looks like a flame, linking with the element of his suit—he is burning with ambition. The Page\\'s tall wand is higher than him, showing that his ideas are greater than his experience, but he is inspired to overcome any shortfall in his knowledge with enthusiasm. His passion will propel him forward as he sees the potential in everything.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Earth of Fire, which is the most grounded aspect of the passionate Fire element of this suit. The Earth and Fire elements combine in the pyramids, to the right of the picture—they comprise a square base (the square is an Earth symbol) and triangular sides (the triangle is a symbol of Fire). The pyramids also signify grand design, establishment, and wisdom—to which our ingénue Page aspires. He wears orange hose, the color of his Fire element, and a tunic decorated with black salamanders, creatures with legendary fireproof skin. The yellow background of the tunic fabric and the trim of the Page\\'s boots echo the yellow tunic of the Fool (see page 30), who too aims to set the world alight. The Page\\'s wand, with its five buds, echoes nature and growth. He may be in an arid desert land, but he has the resources to succeed.\\n\\nPages and Knights in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Page in a reading by working with the card\\'s imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As an influence:** The Page of Wands in a reading brings good news about projects and any situation that requires negotiation. Messages, urgent emails, and phone calls keep you busy and may be demanding, but cool the fire a little and take a measured view before you react and assess just how much work you need to do. The atmosphere overall, however, is one of trust, and you can rely upon information you receive. Pages, with their youth, suggest young, or new, situations, from relationships to work.\\n\\nThe Page of Wands can bring a creative enterprise or job offer—and, while the status of the job may not be as high as you might expect, the overall package may appeal, at least in theory. Do, however, check the details and practicalities before you agree to anything.\\n\\nAs a person: A talkative, entertaining individual, the Page of Wands often turns up in reading to denote a writer. His wand is his pen, his way to express himself in the world at large. Equally, he may be a marketing executive, salesperson, actor, or team manager—any role that relies on personality and great communication skills. This Page is a hard worker, dedicated and enthusiastic, and charming company. He can influence others—just be aware that he can get bored easily and move on to whatever attracts him next (so if you see him as a potential lover, note his actions as well as his words). An additional interpretation of the Page is a reunion with a friend or old colleague with whom you will enjoy chatting and reminiscing.\\n\\n# As the \"you\" card in a reading:\\n\\nExpress yourself.\\n\\n# As an influence:\\n\\nIf two or more Pages fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Pages: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed\\n* Three Pages: Lots of social activities\\n* Four Pages: A social group of young people\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Page of Wands brings delays. Emails and other messages go astray and communication gets complicated. As a person, the Page reversed talks much like his upright counterpart, but the theme of the conversation is negative and rather relentless. As the upright Page holds fast to his goals, so the reversed Page won\\'t let a morose subject drop. The card can also show stubbornness and an inability to listen to others\\' opinions.  This Page is fickle and does not follow through what he initiates. Eventually, his enthusiasm or obsessions burn out, he becomes easily bored or distracted, and he leaves you to deal with any fallout. An additional meaning is problems with literacy and can apply to a child or young person struggling with written communication or speech.\\n\\n# KNIGHT OF WANDS\\n\\nElement: Fire of Fire\\nAstrological Associations: Scorpio and Sagittarius\\nKey Meaning: A proposal\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE KNIGHT OF WANDS\\n\\nA horse appears to be dancing in the desert, near some pyramids. There\\'s a flamboyant rider, full of verve and vigor; holding a wand, this Knight is on a mission to deliver a message.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Fire of the suit of Fire. Fire doubled is a hot mix of passion, ambition, and desire, expressed in many of the card\\'s motifs. The horse\\'s mane and the Knight\\'s red plume, sleeve, and saddle resemble flames; the three pyramids on the left of the card, with their triangular sides, link with the Fire element; and the Knight\\'s tunic has a pattern of black salamanders, the creatures with legendary fireproof skin (see the Page of Wands, page 224). The wand itself can be seen as a torch, the carrier of a flame. The yellow tunic stands for the light of the sun, or the mind and conscious illumination.\\n\\nAlthough the card\\'s imagery speaks of fiery ambition and desire, there\\'s no sense of chaos, danger, or imminent battle. The horse\\'s reins are short and tight, which at first glance gives the impression that the horse is dancing or performing dressage. The Knight has control over the primal urges of the animal and knows when to give free rein and when to hold back.\\n\\nThe wand has no flame, but it is living wood, sprouting five buds, symbols of news and ideas. The number five in the tarot\\'s minor arcana suits also indicates tests—with the Knight of Wands, the test is to control fiery impulses and manage our energy and talent to achieve success, much like the charioteer of card VII, The Chariot (see page 58). The three, the number of pyramids on the card, is a dynamic number, for creativity and production (see also card III, The Empress, page 42).\\n\\nKnights and Pages in tarot are generally regarded as people or influences, whereas the other court cards (the Queens and Kings) are assumed to be people. Let your intuition guide you toward the most appropriate meaning for the Knight in a reading by working with the card\\'s imagery first, then the written interpretations here (see also the Introduction, page 8).\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As an influence:** Events speed up. Any blocks to progress will be lifted, so this is a welcome card if you have been waiting for decisions or have generally been feeling stuck. You can now have the conversations and action you need to move your projects on; follow your intuition and push forward. This card is particularly auspicious for moving house, finding new work, and making progress on personal and professional projects. In readings, this Knight often appears to predict a successful writing project. In other creative pursuits, you attract acknowledgment and support, both emotionally and financially. An additional meaning of the card is travel and emigration.\\n\\n## As a person:\\n\\nCreative and dynamic, the Knight of Wands is an innovator and likes to do things his way. He inspires those around him and is excellent at networking to promote his ideas. He may be a traveler or visitor, and he will have had many experiences and stories to tell. He is, however, impatient to get things done and can make snap judgments about people based on first impressions. As a potential partner, he can show a charismatic, talkative individual who may take things a little too fast at first.\\n\\n## As the \"you\" card in a reading:\\n\\nFire up your ambition.\\n\\n## As an influence:\\n\\nIf two or more Knights fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Knights: Friendship if upright; rivalry if one or both cards are reversed\\n* Three Knights: Men meeting up\\n* Four Knights: Lots of action; events speed up\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nIn general, the reversed Knight of Wands reveals a creative block or miscommunication—so emails go astray and other messages are not delivered. The reversed Knight also indicates delays and deferred decisions; you may feel frustrated at the lack of progress. Know that this influence is temporary and will pass. In the meantime, hold fast to your plans and your self-belief.  As a person, the reversed Knight is egotistical. He thrives on status but is generally unwilling to do any hard work to deserve it; regardless, he will step up to take the credit. Insincere and attention-seeking, he acts out of self-interest.\\n\\n# QUEEN OF WANDS\\n\\n**Element:** Water of the suit of Fire\\n**Astrological Associations:** Pisces and Aries\\n**Chakras:** Sacral, throat, and third eye, for creativity, communication and insight\\n**Key Meanings:** Creativity and focus\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE QUEEN OF WANDS\\n\\nThe Queen of Wands is an aspect of card III, The Empress, or mother archetype. She is the soul aspect of the mother, just as The Queen of Cups is the heart aspect and the Queen of Swords, the mind (see pages 144, 200, and The Empress, page 42).\\n\\nThe most vital of the four Queens, the Queen of Wands sits directly facing us, holding a tall wand, her suit symbol of creativity and purpose. Like the Magician (see page 34), she manifests her ideas to follow her soul\\'s path. The wood of the wand is alive with green shoots; it is the Queen\\'s job to see them thrive. In her left hand is a sunflower, a solar symbol for energy, growth, and illumination. Three tiny buds shoot from the upper part of the wand. Three is a dynamic number of creation, and also the number of her ancestor card, the Empress.\\n\\nThe red-haired Queen\\'s suit element is Fire, shown in many motifs on her card. Robed in gold, her throne is decorated with sunflowers and heraldic lions in orange, the color of flames. Low pyramids appear to her left. The triangle shape of the pyramids is a symbol for Fire in alchemy, and these ancient structures also offer a metaphor for this Queen\\'s strong foundation in the world.\\n\\nAlong with Fire, her suit element, the Queen also takes Water, the element of all the Queens. The combination of Fire and Water reveals the careful balancing of emotion and ideas to create conditions for success. Both practical and cerebral, she is highly resourceful, knowing when to draw upon her Fire energy to take action or attune to her Water emotions to show sensitivity to her environment and others\\' needs.\\n\\nIn esoteric tarot, the Queen of Wands is associated with the leopard, but in the Rider-Waite deck, she is shown with a black cat, a sign of magic—the witch\\'s familiar. The statuary lions on each side of her throne symbolize Sekhmet, an ancient Egyptian lioness deity associated with Bastet, depicted originally as a lioness and later as a cat. The Queen of Wands wears a red cat brooch at her heart, a Bastet amulet, which symbolizes power, protection, and pleasure.\\n\\nQueens and Kings in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the Queen as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As a person:** This Queen is often the card of the artisan, entrepreneur, counselor, organizer, or leader—the writer, producer, marketer, or business administrator: whatever relies upon spark and communication for success. Sociable and supportive, she is intensely loyal, just like her associated sign of Aries. This self-aware Queen is also in touch with her intuition, so she makes good choices in relationships. The Queen of Wands often loves nature and animals, too.\\n\\n## As an influence:\\nIdeas flourish, and you can now show others what you can do. This is no time for reticence; fire up your enthusiasm and express yourself. Reflect, also, on how you are managing your life just now, to make sure you have the time to make space for the opportunities coming your way. Overall, though, the Queen of Wands shows you will have the strength you need, and your relationships, too, are energized—romance, friendships, family ties, and professional contacts.\\n\\n## As the \"you\" card in a reading:\\nStep in to your power.\\n\\n## As an influence:\\nIf two or more Queens fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Queens: Rivalry\\n* Three Queens: Helpful friends\\n* Four Queens: Women meeting up\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nYou may feel controlled when the Queen of Wands reverses due to others\\' pointless interference. There is a great need for organization—but disorder rules. This may be because you, or someone close, has taken on too much and cannot admit it. Consider if this is a pattern—a way of avoiding being who you are, due to fear of rejection.\\n\\nAs a person, the reversed Queen of Wands breaks promises. She can be envious and does not want anyone around her to shine more brightly.\\n\\n# KING OF WANDS\\n\\n**Element:** Air of the suit of Fire\\n**Astrological Associations:** Cancer and Leo\\n**Chakras:** The sacral, throat, and third eye, for creativity, communication, and insight\\n**Key Meaning:** An honorable man\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE KING OF WANDS\\n\\nThe King of Wands is an aspect of card IV, The Emperor, or father archetype, who brings structure, order, and authority. The King of Wands is the father-aspect of the Emperor who offers inspiration and communication.\\n\\nThe King\\'s robe and the back of his throne are decorated with black salamanders, the creatures who have legendary fireproof skin (see also the Knight and Page of Wands, pages 226 and 224). A live salamander appears to the right of the card to reinforce its importance as a symbol of the King\\'s suit element of Fire. Lions also decorate the throne, and the King wears a lion-head amulet around his neck, a symbol of strength and protection linking with one of his zodiac signs, Leo the Lion.\\n\\nHis wand has four buds, which relate to the number of his ancestor card IV, The Emperor, and also symbolizes the four elements. His crown, cuffs, and cape have flame motifs, and he wears a fiery orange robe and cloak. His cap is red—at first glance, it would appear he has red hair, but this is actually called a \"cap of maintenance,\" worn by nobility and the other three minor arcana Kings (see pages 146, 176, and 198), that fits under a crown. Red and orange denote passion in the real world—or fiery ambition.\\n\\nThe card\\'s element is Air of Fire, which can be interpreted as fire that breathes. The more air a fire has to burn, the brighter the fire and higher the flames. This also reveals the King\\'s challenge: to keep feeding his desires without burning himself out. The green of his cowl and shoes symbolizes nature and wood, which feeds a fire, so he is mindful that to thrive, he needs to be in a productive, supportive environment.\\n\\nKings and Queens in tarot are traditionally regarded as people in your life or people about to come into your orbit. However, you can also read the King as a general influence, so this interpretation is included last.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\n**As a person:** This King of Wands is a man of the world, and it\\'s likely that he has traveled widely, experiencing many cultures and countries. Talkative and energetic, his ideal vocations include business and management, communications and marketing, the travel industry, acting, and other roles that depend on self-motivation and individuality. He may be self-employed, running a business or acting as a freelance consultant. His has wisdom, very high standards that he applies to himself and those around him, and strong integrity. Courteous and considerate, he stays true to his values and acts according to his moral code. He is open and self-aware and does not judge other people on their backgrounds or beliefs; he often learns by listening to people talk about their experiences. As a free spirit, he respects others who don\\'t conform. As a potential partner, he is passionate and communicative.\\n\\n## As an influence:\\nThis is the right time to express your ideas and be the individual you are. Summon your entrepreneurial spirit, make a plan, and what you propose will be well received. The practical support you need will be there, but you need to be the initiator. What you do now reflects your truth. Don\\'t let perfectionism get in the way of your creativity—what you do is more than good enough.\\n\\n## As the \"you\" card in a reading:\\nBe a free spirit.\\n\\n## As an influence:\\nIf two or more Kings fall close together in a reading, the meanings are as follows:\\n\\n* Two Kings: A good partnership\\n* Three Kings: Influential men\\n* Four Kings: A power battle\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThis card reversed indicates a time of restriction when you can\\'t get others to see your point of view. Equally, check that you\\'re not going against your intuition if you feel you\\'re not following the right path—drop the self-pressure and be open to alternative routes.\\n\\nBullying, selfish, and opinionated, the reversed King as a person is narrow-minded and obsessive about rules. He can be an overbearing manager or a strict parental figure. He does not want to listen to anyone who doesn\\'t agree with him, and full of self-interest, he is determined to get his own way.\\n\\n'),\n",

With a head full of hope, he is idealistic rather than practical; he is certainly not dressed for travel. The little dog at his heels tries to warn him of impending peril, but the Fool is blissfully ignorant of the risk he takes in stepping off a cliff. He is about to encounter danger, but how else can he make his way in the world?\\n\\nWe all begin life as a zero, a tiny egg of potential. The Fool is the cosmic egg, symbolized by the shape of his number, 0. As he journeys through the major arcana sequence, he is a part of every card, but he also stands outside the sequence, without a formal value. An absolute beginner, he is about to explore the world, gain experience, and leave behind his status as a zero, a no-being. He will travel lightly, without the baggage of commitment. The Fool is the dreamer, lead only by his needs and desires.\\n\\nUsually depicted as a youth, the Fool must grow to become a man in the next card in the tarot sequence: the Magician—an individual who knows life and has identified what he needs to succeed in it. The Fool on his journey will collect, in his bag, the four symbols of the minor arcana suits (the Cup, Sword, Pentacle, and Wand): These items are the essence of his survival—the Cup to drink from; the Sword to defend himself; the Pentacle, a coin, for victuals; and the Wand to connect him with his higher self. At this stage of his journey, he is yet to discover the power and meaning of these objects; when he fully understands their purpose, he may progress to the next stage of life, ready to morph into card I, the Magician. Even though his number is zero, his preceding card is the World, card XXI. Some tarotists even assign him number XXII/0, to show that the Fool is both the end and the beginning of the card sequence.\\n\\n# THE FOOL\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Fool\\'s element is Air, which is fitting, given he is about to step off a precipice into the ether and on his travels will go wherever the wind blows. While the Fool is not linked with a zodiac sign, he does have a planet, Uranus, which symbolizes independence and a free spirit.\\n\\n# THE FOOL AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Fool\\'s letter is Aleph, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It has no sound\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright fool signifies calculated risk. It\\'s never too late to begin anew and follow your heart\\'s desire. The journey ahead is not without danger, but it is time to take a leap of faith. This card augers well for those embarking on new enterprises and educational courses, provided sensible planning is in place; this is a time for optimism and a fresh perspective.\\n\\nThe Fool brings an opportunity to start over and feel young again or excited at the prospect of a new way of living; the Fool is an embodiment of your spirit, whether male or female, ready to explore and discover. Whatever you start now will go well, provided you do look before you leap—but once the decision is made, it\\'s time to push forward and not look back; have courage, commit to your path, and be fully in the moment. The Fool\\'s appearance in a reading can bring a sigh of relief, in that there is now a way ahead. Welcome in the new and travel lightly.\\n\\nHere are some insights the Fool can offer in particular areas of life:\\n\\n* **Home:** The Fool can show a young person leaving home for the first time. Also, surprise visitors could call. You may also have younger guests in your home.\\n* **Relationships:** A new relationship—go with the flow at this point.\\n* **Career and money:** You may have sabbatical or a new opportunity in your current job or a new career or enterprise. Prioritizing your workload is also the key to moving ahead swiftly.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nIs what you\\'re proposing—or a situation offered to you—a leap too far? The Fool reversed brings out his irresponsible side, as his mouth works ahead of his brain. Without thinking through the downsides, the Fool makes decisions that are not wise. The reversed Fool leaps without awareness and so becomes the  literal\\tidiot,\\tsabotaging\\this\\tchances\\tdue\\tto\\tdesperation\\tand\\tirrationality.\\tThink carefully\\tbefore\\tagreeing\\ta\\tnew\\tapproach\\tto\\twork\\tand\\thold\\tback\\tfrom\\temotional commitments\\tuntil\\tyou\\tare\\tsure\\tof\\tyour\\tground.\\n\\n# HIS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nLeap, but look first.\\n\\n# THE FOOL\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Fool appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The dog represents instinct and self-preservation. The animal tries to warn the Fool that he is about to walk off a cliff, but the Fool is oblivious to his warning.\\nSee this symbol on card XVIII, The Moon.\\n\\n* The white rose or butterfly: The white rose stands for purity and innocence. Some cards show the Fool with a butterfly, a symbol of dreams and spirit.\\nSee the white rose symbol on card XIII, Death.\\n\\n* The bundle: The Fool carries little in his bundle—just his essentials and four talismans, the symbols of the minor arcana.\\n\\n* The white sun: This is a symbol of consciousness, of the workings of the mind that are directly expressed. As the sun rises, it illuminates the Fool\\'s world, showing it all in the best possible light. The sun is white, which links with the Fool\\'s chakra of the crown and has purity of spirit.\\nSee the golden sun on card VI, The Lovers; XIV, Temperance; XIII, Death; XVIII, The Moon; and XIX, The Sun.\\n\\n* The red feather: The red feather in the Fool\\'s cap denotes his life force.\\nSee this symbol on card XIX, The Sun, and XIII, Death.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL FOOL: IDIOT AND JOKER\\n\\nIn the earliest tarots, the Visconti-Sforza, the Fool looks very different from the jester-boy we see on twentieth-century decks. With feathers in his hair and his breeches down to his knees, the historical Fool is a figure of ridicule—the village idiot, without dignity—yet the overarching theme of the Fool of Renaissance Europe was as a signifier of Lent. The seven chicken feathers in his hair and his traveler\\'s bundle represent a poor man. He is not a court jester but rather a symbol of poverty, a temporary reminder that worldly goods are not everything; what is in our hearts is more important.\\n\\nThe Fool archetype was part of the Roman festival of Saturnalia (see page 11) in which the major arcana characters paraded in chariots while the Fool ran around to tease and torment them. This is another reason why he is unnumbered—he had no official place in the procession. The Fool survives today as the Joker in the standard fifty-two pack of playing cards.\\n\\n# THE FOOL\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nThe beginner aspect of the Fool is held in the minor arcana\\'s four Aces: the Ace of Cups (new love), the Ace of Pentacles (new money), the Ace of Wands (new initiatives), and the Ace of Swords (new success); see pages 120, 148, 204, and 176. He is also reflected in the Three of Wands, for travel, and the Eight of Wands, for movement, messages, and activity.\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE FOOL\\n\\nTake the Fool from your deck and set him before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan the cards out facedown. Choose five cards with your left hand and lay them out, as shown. You could ask, \"What do I need to do to follow my path in life?\" or \"Is this risk worth taking?\"\\n\\n* Card 1: You and your situation\\n* Card 2: The risks\\n\\n# Card 3: The potential rewards Card 4: What you can gain Card 5: Advice and likely outcome\\n\\n```\\n     [2]     [3]\\n   The Fool   [5]\\n     [1]     [4]\\n\\n```\\n| Card # | Position                    | Meaning                                                             |\\n| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Fool   | **Significator**            | Represents the querent\\'s leap, new path, or spiritual beginning     |\\n| 1      | **You and Your Situation**  | Where you are now, the starting point, your mindset                 |\\n| 2      | **The Risks**               | Challenges, dangers, or what you must be cautious about             |\\n| 3      | **The Potential Rewards**   | What success or positive outcomes might result from taking the leap |\\n| 4      | **What You Can Gain**       | Personal growth, skills, insights, or support you\\'ll collect        |\\n| 5      | **Advice & Likely Outcome** | Guidance for navigating the path and where things may lead          |\\n---\\n\\n# I THE MAGICIAN\\n\\n**Alternative Names:** The Magus, The Juggler, The Mountebank\\n**Number:** I\\n**Numerology Links:** X, The Wheel of Fortune, and XIX, The Sun\\n**Astrological Sign or Planet:** Mercury\\n**Element:** Air; also ether, the quintessence\\n**Hebrew Letter:** Beth (Beit)\\n**Symbol:** House\\n**Meaning:** Creativity\\n**Tree of Life Pathway:** Second, between Kether and Binah\\n**Chakra:** The palm chakras, for manifesting\\n**Key Meanings:** Action, creativity, and success\\n\\n# I\\nTHE MAGICIAN.\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE MAGICIAN\\n\\nHere we have a Magician in action, complete with magic wand and the implements of his trade on the table before him: the suit symbols of the Pentacle or coin, Cup, Sword, and Wand, representing the four elements of earth, water, air, and fire, respectively. With these base materials, he sets an intention to transmute them to create the fifth element of ether, or the quintessence—the mythological \"breath of the gods.\" The Magician, who once journeyed as the Fool, is now ready to manifest his desires by aligning spirit and matter. As the conduit between earth and heaven, the Magician stands for decisions and creativity. The roses and lilies growing above and below him tell us that life can be beautiful when we commit to our passions.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the Magician comes after 0, The Fool, although the Magician can also be seen as the first card of the cycle, as some tarotists place the Fool after the World card as XXII. The Magician is the natural successor to the Fool as we move from 0, the cosmic egg, to I, the individual: The Fool\\'s bundle contains the Magician\\'s four symbols, ready to be activated. After the singular purpose of the Magician we meet II, The High Priestess, who introduces us to the duality of life—the now and the hereafter.\\n\\nThe Magician\\'s number, I, is the first prime number, which stands for primal energy, the individual, and oneness with the divine spirit or God. The card is related to X, The Wheel of Fortune (10 reduces to 1), and XIX, or 19, The Sun, which reduces to 10 then 1, the Magician\\'s number. Both these cards link with an awareness of realms beyond the earthly plane.\\n\\n# THE MAGICIAN\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Magician\\'s ruling planet is Mercury, also the Roman god of magic—and the Greek Hermes, god of communication, linked with the Egyptian god Thoth. In alchemy, mercury\\'s form as quicksilver was associated with transformation or the fifth element of ether. The element could also be signified by the symbol of a snake, shown on the Magician\\'s serpent-girdle (see The Magician\\'s Symbols).\\n\\n# THE MAGICIAN AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Hebrew letter of the Magician is Beth, symbolized by a house, meaning creativity. On the Tree of Life pathway, the Magician is placed on the second pathway between the spheres of Kether and Binah. Kether stands for unity, echoing the card\\'s number, I, while Binah is the sphere of experience—indicating practical magic and singular direction.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nIt\\'s time for action—for communicating and expressing your ideas and desires. This is the card of the inventor, the traveler, the self-employed, and the entrepreneur, as it beckons you to broaden your horizons. You will have the drive to spur your plans forward, and, perhaps, to take new, creative approaches: to think laterally, ask questions, trust your internal guidance, and let go of procrastination.\\n\\nBlessed with a magic wand, you have the ability to transform whatever you choose, and in this way, the Magician is a very positive card in a reading. He directs you to make the most of your skills and talents and step into your power; focus on your projects and capitalize on your personal strengths. Spiritually, the Magician shows you connecting with your higher, or true, self and acting with pure intention.\\n\\nThis card can also show a significant journey.\\n\\nHere are some other possibilities:\\n\\n* **Home:** A house sale is completed, or you decide it is time to move forward with remodeling plans. This is a sociable time, with lots of visitors and entertaining.\\n\\n* **Relationships:** If you are single and want love, it is coming. If you are in a relationship, the Magician shows love in action, so you will begin to see commitment. Communication between you is excellent and you reach an even deeper understanding of each other\\'s needs. The card can also show you acting as one, so a joint project may be on the horizon, too.\\n\\n* **Career and money:** There will be a new beginning, either finding new employment or a new direction in your existing work. This card can also show inspired leadership from a grounded and enthusiastic individual.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the good Magician is reversed, he turns trickster, so this card can show you being mislead by a charming manipulator. What you see is not what you get and\\tit’s\\tall\\tshow,\\tnot\\ttruth.\\tIn\\tyour\\tprojects,\\tthe\\tMagician\\treversed\\tcan\\tshow\\ta creative\\tblock\\tas\\tyou\\tfeel\\ttorn\\tbetween\\ttwo\\tpaths\\tor\\tchoices\\tthat\\tget\\tin\\tthe\\tway of\\tprogress.\\tIt’s\\ttime\\tto\\tchoose\\tone\\toption\\tand\\tcommit\\tto\\tit\\tfully.\\tThe\\treversed card\\tcan\\talso\\treveal\\tdelays\\tto\\ttravel\\tplans\\tand\\tmiscommunication\\tin\\tgeneral.\\n\\n# HIS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nManifest your desires.\\n\\n# THE MAGICIAN\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Magician appears with the following magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The lemniscate or infinity symbol: balance, activity, and renewal\\nSee this symbol on card VIII, Strength.\\n\\n* The magic wand: The wand is double-ended and reflects the Hermetic concept \"As above, so below,\" or heaven and earth as mirrors. The wand\\'s symbolism reflects that of the Magician\\'s pose (see below).\\nSee this symbol on cards VII, The Chariot, and XXI, The World.\\n\\n* The four suit symbols: These are the Magician\\'s resources. He draws upon the four elements of the suits to create the quintessence, the fifth element.\\n\\n* The red cloak: energy and action; practicality; and being grounded in the material world\\nSee this symbol on IV, The Emperor; V, the Hierophant; and XI, Justice.\\n\\n* The headband: The mind and the intention to manifest desires\\n\\n* The Magician and his pose: The Magician is the conduit of energy between earth, which he draws from with his downward left hand, and heaven, symbolized by his raised hand and wand.\\n\\n* The serpent-girdle: The belt around the Magician\\'s waist is a serpent, a symbol of the element of Mercury, the Magician\\'s ruling planet (see The Magician\\'s Astrology). To function as a belt, the serpent or snake must hold\\n\\nIts tail in its mouth. This is the alchemical symbol of the ouroborus, which like the lemniscate stands for infinity and constant renewal—just as the snake continually sheds its skin.\\n\\n* The roses and lilies: The red roses symbolize love and the lilies, truth of purpose. The Magician acts with pure intention. See red roses on the gown in card III, The Empress, and on the gown of the supplicant on the left on card V, The Hierophant; roses are also around the waist of the maiden on VIII, Strength.\\n* Yellow background: consciousness, clear sight and support See this on III, The Empress; VII, The Chariot; VIII, Strength; and XI, Justice.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL MAGICIAN: MAN AND GOD\\n\\nHistorically, the Magician has had many guises. In the fifteenth-century Visconti-Sforza tarots, he was a wealthy merchant seated at a table. By the nineteenth century, the Dotti tarot of Milan assigned him as a cobbler—Il Bagatto. By the twentieth century, he had transformed into a magus, then a god.\\n\\nMost early tarots show the Magician seated at a table, while a standing pose appears to have been generally accepted by the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as seen in Marseilles-style tarots. But in our Rider-Waite deck, the standing Magician takes on a spiritual dimension, pointing to heaven and earth. Aleister Crowley takes the Magician a step further in his Thoth deck, showing his Magus card as the winged messenger-god Hermes, or Mercury, also the ruling planet of the card. Hermes as a god represented wisdom and was believed to be the architect of the pyramids and the creator of mathematics, astrology, and other arts. The Magician today embodies this spirit of invention, enterprise, and expression.\\n\\n# THE MAGICIAN\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nBecause the Magician has all four suits represented on his table—Cup, Pentacle, Sword, and Wand—he can be seen as the ruler of the entire minor arcana. His appearance in a reading can ask you to pay particular attention to the minors—note which suits or elements they represent, as this will give you an instant overview of which life area is important now.\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE MAGICIAN: THE MAGIC WAND\\n\\nTake the Magician from your deck and lay him before you, as shown. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. \\n\\nChoose four cards with your left hand and place them around the Magician in the positions below. You could ask, \"What can I manifest?\" or \"What do I need to do to make my idea work?\"\\n\\n* Card 1: Your situation\\n* Card 2: Emotional strengths\\n* Card 3: Practical skills and resources\\n* Card 4: The outcome\\n\\n```\\n[4] — The Outcome\\n[3] — Practical Skills & Resources\\n[2] — Emotional Strengths\\n[1] — Your Situation\\n[The Magician] — Significator\\n```\\n| Card #   | Position                         | Meaning                                                             |\\n| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Magician | **Significator**                 | Represents your power to act, initiate, and channel creative energy |\\n| 1        | **Your Situation**               | Current state of your goal or the idea you want to manifest         |\\n| 2        | **Emotional Strengths**          | Inner courage, resilience, or motivation you can draw on            |\\n| 3        | **Practical Skills & Resources** | Tangible assets, knowledge, or people who can support your goal     |\\n| 4        | **The Outcome**                  | Likely result of the manifestation effort if you follow through     |\\n---\\n\\n# II THE HIGH PRIESTESS\\n\\n**Alternative Name:** The Papess\\n**Number:** II\\n**Numerology Links:** XI, Justice, and XX, Judgment\\n**Astrological Sign or Planet:** The Moon\\n**Element:** Water\\n**Hebrew Letter:** Gimel\\n**Symbol:** Camel\\n**Meaning:** Wisdom\\n**Tree of Life Pathway:** Third, between Kether and Tiphareth\\n**Chakra:** Fifth eye, also known as the angelic or soma chakra, for psychic activation\\n**Key Meanings:** Secrets, wisdom, and the spiritual world\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE HIGH PRIESTESS\\n\\nThe High Priestess stands in an enclosed chamber or temple between two great pillars labeled B and J. Behind her is a veil decorated with pomegranates and date fruit; she wears a horned moon headdress like the Egyptian goddess Hathor, and at her feet lies a crescent moon. She holds a scroll that is partly hidden, bearing the letters t, o, r, and a, indicating the Torah, the Jewish sacred text. She represents the principle of the divine feminine; historically, she is the female Pope, a virgin priestess, signified by her blue-and-white robes. Today, she might be the psychic, astrologer, or spiritual teacher. Her spiritual path is above material values and earthly relationships. Her gift is wisdom; and knowledge of the world beyond the veil, the realms of gods, guides, and angels.\\n\\nThe number of the High Priestess is II, echoed in the two pillars of the temple of Solomon (see The High Priestess\\'s Symbols). Her counterpart in the major arcana sequence is card V, The Hierophant or High Priest. Like the High Priestess, he is a mentor, but he works in public office—the High Priestess, however, tends her inner garden of the spirit in secret, walking between the earth plane and the celestial realms beyond, separated by the pomegranate veil. She lives a dual life. She comes after I, The Magician, card of unity and outward expression, and before card III, The Empress. The High Priestess reveals that we need superconsciousness and awareness of the self before we can wholly engage in abundant relationships with others, which are embodied by the mother-goddess Empress.\\n\\nShe is numerologically linked with cards XI, Justice (11; 1 + 1 = 2), and XX, Judgment (2 + 0 = 2). Both these cards illuminate the need for discernment, wisdom, and discretion.\\n\\n# THE HIGH PRIESTESS\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe High Priestess\\'s element is Water, the element of the emotions, and her planet is the moon. The moon relates to intuition, the feminine cycles, and the rhythms of nature. She wears a crown showing the moon\\'s waxing, waning, and full phases (see The High Priestess\\'s Symbols).\\n\\n# THE HIGH PRIESTESS AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe High Priestess\\'s kabbalistic letter is Gimel, the third letter of the Hebrew alphabet,\\twhich\\tliterally\\tmeans\\tcamel,\\tbut\\talso\\tsuggests\\twisdom.\\tOn\\tthe\\tTree\\tof Life,\\tshe\\tis\\tplaced\\ton\\tthe\\tthird\\tpathway,\\tbetween\\tthe\\tspheres\\tof\\tKether\\tand Tiphareth,\\tor\\toneness\\twith\\tGod\\tand\\tharmony/rebirth—a\\tjourney\\tto\\tinner\\tpeace\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nHidden knowledge, intuition, psychic experience, and significant dreams are the gifts of the High Priestess. This is a time for incubation and privacy, to go inward, deepening your relationship with your higher self and trusting your internal knowing. In your everyday life, confidentiality is key. If you have a secret, or a project you are nurturing, it is better to keep your own counsel. \\nOn your spiritual path, the High Priestess predicts learning and a mentor. As the card of psychic gifts (along with card X, The Wheel of Fortune), her arrival in your reading can be a sign to follow your intuition and connect with your guides. If the High Priestess shows up in one of your first tarot readings, this is often a sign that tarot is part of your spiritual journey. Here are some other signs she can reveal:\\n\\n* **Home:** It\\'s a quiet time. Relations between family members may be calm but a little distant; you may be buried in your separate lives just now.\\n* **Relationships:** This can mean being single for a time or, if you are in a relationship, you or your partner choosing to keep a part of your life separate, or secret.\\n* **Career and money:** Success is coming, but contracts and new work are taking time to nurture. You can only be patient.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the High Priestess can show an inappropriate mentor or choosing a temporarily wrong path. You might be listening to bad advice or someone might try to persuade you to go against your intuition. It can also indicate secrets that need to be out in the open; knowledge locked up too long may be potentially harmful.\\n\\n# HER WISDOM MESSAGE\\nExplore\\tyour\\tspiritual\\tside.\\n\\n# THE HIGH PRIESTESS\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the High Priestess appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The two pillars: The initials B and J refer to Boaz and Jachin, names on pillars in the Temple of Solomon in the Old Testament, which were decorated with pomegranate designs (see pomegranate below). Boaz represents the elements of Water and Earth, and Jachin, Fire and Air. The pillars are black and white, to show duality—male and female, darkness and light, and the earthly and heavenly dimensions that the High Priestess inhabits. The pillars form a portal to otherworldly experience and a deeper experience of the self. See this symbol on cards V, The Hierophant, and XI, Justice, to symbolize balance.\\n\\n* The scroll: The High Priestess holds the Sefer Torah, a hand-written scroll central to the study of Kabbala. It symbolizes the High Priestess\\'s spiritual knowledge. See the book as a symbol on card X, The Wheel of Fortune.\\n\\n* The pomegranate: On the High Priestess\\'s veil, the pomegranate denotes female fertility, linking with her aspect as the Egyptian goddess Hathor (see the moon below). The pomegranate can also be a symbol of the Jewish sacred text—it has been taught that the fruit has 613 seeds, echoing the Torah\\'s 613 biblical commandments.\\n\\n* The veil: The veil symbolizes the otherworld beyond the material world.\\n\\n* The date: Masculinity, complementing the female pomegranate\\n\\n* The moon: This is a symbol of the subconscious and the emotions that lie beneath the solar or external persona. The moon is shown in three phases as a crown to echo Hathor/Isis, the Egyptian goddess of life and fertility who gave birth to Ra, god of the sun. See this symbol on card XVIII, The Moon.\\n\\n* The blue-and-white robes: White is for purity, relating to the traditional virginity of the nun. Blue is for truth, as in \"true blue.\"\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL HIGH PRIESTESS: FEMALE POPES\\n\\nIn the Visconti-Sforza tarots (see page 10), the High Priestess bears the likeness of Maria Visconti, a relative of the Duke of Milan, who commissioned some of the earliest tarot cards. Maria was a nun and a member of the Guglielmite sect, which believed that Christ would return to earth in 1300 and a female pope would rule. Maria, also known as Sister Manfreda, was chosen to become the first female pope—hence the card\\'s alternative name, The Papess. Before her ambition could be realized, she was burned at the stake as a heretic in 1300.\\n\\nThe High Priestess as the Papess also links with the legend of St. Joan, chronicled in the thirteenth century by the Dominican monk Stephen of Bourbon. His myth tells of a ninth-century Englishwoman named Joan who eloped with a Benedictine monk. To disguise herself, she dressed as a man and named herself John of England. Her lover died, but she traveled to Rome, became a highly respected educator, and eventually was elected Pope. However, during the coronation procession she collapsed with labor pains, and her true identity as a woman was exposed. How she died varies according to different accounts—from instant demise after the birth, to being stoned to death, to being deposed and punished. Her child survived, and in the legend he was identified as the Bishop of Ostia, one of the diocese of Rome.\\n\\nIn Marseilles-style tarots of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the High Priestess wears a papal crown, but otherwise this learned woman is very much as we see her in the Rider-Waite card, seated and robed, holding a holy book.\\n\\n# THE HIGH PRIESTESS\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\n* The Queen of Swords, for strength of will and following your path\\n* The Eight of Pentacles, for study, knowledge, and reward\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE HIGH PRIESTESS: THE ORACLE\\n\\nTake the High Priestess from your deck and lay her before you on your left-hand side.

She bears the symbol of Venus on her shield, relating to her planet, Venus, and the Roman goddess of love. In pre-Roman times, Venus was much more than the ruler of relationships: She was the earth mother, nature herself. She is seated in an earthly paradise, where corn grows at her feet. A river meanders then flows into a waterfall, forming an abundant pool. All the trees are in full leaf. This is summer, a time of harvest and plenty. The Empress leans slightly back, supported by a cushion and bolster, as if she has transplanted herself from indoors to her garden. While living in the material world, she stays connected to her roots and goes with the flow of life. Her pose and lose gown may suggest she is pregnant, and some decks show an obviously pregnant Empress. While the High Priestess is lunar and virginal, incubating herself spiritually to connect with the twilight realms beyond, the Empress manifests her femininity. She is the solar, earthly, and fertile aspect of womanhood, also indicated by the rich yellows, reds, oranges, and green colors of her card. Her number, III, is dynamic and creative and stands for the triad of mother, father, and child. In early decks such as the Visconti-Sforza tarots, she is shown with a black eagle, matching the insignia of card IV, The Emperor—she is clearly an empress rather than a queen; the four Queens are her aspects (see The Empress\\'s Reflections). As the consort of card IV, The Emperor, the Empress also represents the wife and traditional relationships. She is numerologically connected with XII, The Hanged Man—time suspended, presumably during pregnancy—and XXI, The World, expressing the joy of birth or creation.\\n\\n# THE EMPRESS\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Empress is linked with Venus, planet of love, and with warmth, relationships, light, and abundance.\\n\\n# THE EMPRESS AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Empress\\'s Hebrew letter is Daleth, or door, and attainment. As a mother, she represents the gateway to new life. This also complements the Hebrew letter of her tarot partner, the Emperor, which is Hei, the window: two aspects of the house of the soul.\\n\\nOn the Tree of Life, she is placed on the fourth pathway between the spheres of Binah and Chockmah. Binah is female intelligence, while Chockmah is male wisdom. The seeds of male and female within the Empress conceive new life.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe gifts of the Empress are abundance and material comfort, sensuality and security, and emotional support. This is an auspicious card for children and families, showing harmony at home; if you are hoping to begin a family, the Empress symbolizes fertility and femininity. Your creative projects thrive and you prosper financially now, too. The Empress is resourceful, so when she appears in your reading, you can feel assured that your needs will be met. This card, therefore, shows the influence of a nurturing mother figure who supports you. As the you/your situation card in a reading, it reveals you are a good mother to others—and to yourself.\\n\\nHere are some additional possibilities:\\n\\n* **Home:** renovation and extensions, home improvements; considering a move to a larger home; tending a garden\\n* **Relationships:** Happiness—If single, this indicates a good time to begin a relationship. Harmonious relationships exist within the family.\\n* **Career and money:** Security; money flows—In work, you are resourceful, able to support others, and come up with inventive ways to manage your projects.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Empress shows financial issues and domestic strife. This may take the form of a controlling and disruptive influence at home. She can also show a creative block in your projects and someone who is needy and takes too much from you. The result of these challenges and demands is stressful, and there may be an impact on fertility if this is an issue for you now—literally in terms of conceiving a child or figuratively in terms of finding the time and peace of mind to grow an idea.\\n\\n# HER WISDOM MESSAGE\\nLife\\tis\\tabundant.\\n\\n# THE EMPRESS\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Empress appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The starry crown: The half-crown, or diadem, holds twelve stars, a common emblem on paintings of the Virgin Mary; the Book of Revelation 12:1-2 mentions a woman, interpreted as Mary, as, \"Clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.\" The twelve stars may signify the twelve tribes of Israel, and some tarotists associate them with the twelve astrological signs. The number twelve signifies unity.\\n\\n* The laurel wreath: The wreath the Empress wears just below her crown shows peace and success. See this victory symbol on the Six of Wands, the Two of Cups, and the Seven of Cups.\\n\\n* Pomegranates: The pomegranate design on the Empress\\'s dress denotes fertility, death, and rebirth and relates to the myth of the Greek goddess of the harvest, Demeter. The fate of her daughter, Persephone, was determined by Persephone eating the seeds of the pomegranate in the underworld (see The Historical Empress). See this symbol on card II, The High Priestess.\\n\\n* The pearl necklace: The seven pearls, meaning wisdom, also represent the seven major chakras in harmony—base, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, and crown (see page 235). The seven pearls also link with the seven classical planets.\\n\\n* The shield with the sign of Venus: The Venus sign—the circle with the cross beneath—is associated with the goddess Venus, for love, beauty, and creativity. It embodies the sun and the earth.\\n\\n* The scepter: This is an emblem of state. The Empress is ruler of her own land and is secure in her authority. The orb atop it and the Empress\\'s hand position echoes the shape of the sign of Venus. (See Venus above.)\\n\\n* The corn: The ripe corn, ready for harvest, stands for rewards, fertility, and abundance. (See The Historical Empress.)\\n\\nYellow background: consciousness, clear sight, and support\\nSee this on the I, The Magician; VII, The Chariot; VIII, Strength; and XI, Justice.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL EMPRESS: ROOTS OF THE GODDESS\\n\\nThe Empress is the great mother goddess at the heart of many ancient beliefs: the Roman Venus and Diana; the Sumerian Innana, Queen of Heaven; the Celtic goddess Brigid; the Egyptian deities Hathor and Isis; the Virgin Mary; the Nordic goddesses Freyja and Frigg; the Greek Aphrodite and Gaia; and the Hindu Parvati. The ripe corn shown in the foreground of the card also associates the Empress with Demeter, the \"grain mother,\" Greek goddess of the harvest and the cycles of nature. When Demeter\\'s daughter, Persephone, was abducted by Hades, Demeter bargained to get her back by threatening to withhold the grain harvest. It was agreed that Persephone could return to her mother, but only if she had not eaten anything when with Hades. Alas, Persephone had eaten six seeds of the pomegranate (the fruit depicted on the dress of the Empress). And so Persephone was allowed to return to her mother and the earth for six months of the year, through spring and summer, but cursed to spend the other six months of fall and winter in the darkness that was Hades—a metaphor for the rhythms of the seasons that the mother-goddess Empress embodies.\\n\\n# THE EMPRESS\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\n* The Queen of Cups, for love and nurturing—the heart aspect\\n* The Queen of Pentacles, for generosity and security—the physical body\\n* The Queen of Swords, for the intellect—the mind aspect\\n* The Queen of Wands, for creativity and communication—the soul aspect\\n* Nine of Pentacles, for money, luxury, and self-authority\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE EMPRESS: GROWING CREATIVITY AND ABUNDANCE\\n\\nTake the Empress from your deck and lay her before you. Now shuffle all the remaining cards and then cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose three with your left hand and place them around the Empress as shown.

His beard shows he is a man of maturity and wisdom, a forerunner of the Hermit, the other bearded man of the tarot, whom the Emperor will become in later years. Yet at this time of his existence, he is still full of vigor and ready to take action to defend his realm, as we see from the battle armor showing beneath his robes of state.\\n\\nHis number is IV, for the four compass points and for stability and order. The Emperor is sure of his position, and he sits squarely in place on his throne of stone, high-backed and secure in a landscape that appears to be little more than barren rock. Yet the mountains, almost equal in height on each side, seem to protect him, and his throne, higher than the peaks of the rocks, suggests he is in control of this strange environment. A tiny river runs behind him, perceptible at the base of the mountains—a sign of the potential for growth and cultivation of the land as he directs. The Emperor is a pioneer and a true Aries, shown by the rams\\' heads on his throne; his will drives him forward.\\n\\nAnd as the Emperor knows the boundaries of his territory, he is realistic about the sphere of his influence. He also maintains and defends his boundaries appropriately, through rational negotiation rather than force.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the Emperor comes after his consort card III, The Empress, and before card V, The Hierophant. In traditional societies, this sequence reflected power status, from mother under father and priest at the top, being closest to God. The Emperor corresponds in numerology with card XIII, Death, perhaps linking with the Emperor\\'s warrior aspects in that physical death would have been very much part of life as a feudal ruler. The Emperor and Death are the only two major arcana cards that show figures with visible leg armor.\\n\\n# THE EMPEROR\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Emperor\\'s astrological sign is Aries, the Ram the first sign of the zodiac (March 21-April 20). He has fire and determination, the qualities of leadership. Aries is ruled by Mars, planet of war, indicated by the Emperor\\'s armor. It is known as the fiery planet, echoed in the color orange in the landscape behind the Emperor\\'s throne and his red robes, which are also a sign of his sovereignty.\\n\\n# THE EMPEROR AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Emperor\\'s Hebrew letter is Hei, which means progress. Another meaning of Hei is window, or portal, through which streams the light of consciousness. He is fully aware of who he is and of his place in the world. Placed on the fifth Tree of Life pathway between the spheres of Tiphareth, for beauty and rebirth, and Chockmah, male principle.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nIn a reading, the Emperor can denote a powerful man, and the traditional male aspects of rulership and ambition. As the consort of card III, The Empress, he signifies the husband or other intimate partner who is constant and trustworthy. He is in control of his emotions, and comfortable with who he is. Less appealing, depending on your perspective, is his need for conformity. Although he may have ambition, tradition is essential to his happiness. As a general influence or symbol of the self he brings balance, security, and conventional values. He reveals mastery of life and control over territory, and predicts that problems can be overcome with careful planning and single-mindedness. He shows a return to order, so his arrival in your reading is a welcome sign of improvement in your circumstances. You may also be offered protection from someone you trust; you can also trust yourself to make the right decisions.\\n\\nIt\\'s time to live in the here and now, and use what practical resources you possess—wisdom, determination, and the skills of others—to realize your next steps. Be the leader.\\n\\nHere\\'s what he represents in specific areas of your life:\\n\\n* **Home:** Order and smooth running. However, it is also important to set boundaries and protect what is yours.\\n* **Relationships:** A new partner, or focusing on practical matters and future planning in established partnerships. Loyalty in love.\\n* **Career and money:** Finances get organized and you plan how to balance expenditures. You can expect to have fairness at work and to be sure of your goals; you will either enjoy this new structure or feel it stifles your creativity.\\n\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Emperor is power-hungry and excessive in his demands, and represents the negative traits associated with traditional masculinity, such as being domineering, controlling, and even cruel. Greed is another aspect of the Emperor reversed. Whereas the upright Emperor knows his boundaries, the reversed Emperor does not know where to draw the line and may use excessive force or persuasion to get what he wants. This card therefore shows issues with authority figures and other potentially domineering individuals who are run by their egos.\\n\\n# HIS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nTake control; you are protected.\\n\\n# THE EMPEROR\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Emperor appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The rams\\' heads: There are four ram\\'s heads on the card, echoing his number IV: two forward-facing on the front of his throne and two in profile on the top corners. They are the symbol of the Emperor\\'s sign, Aries the Ram. In Egyptian mythology, Khnum, an aspect of the sun god, Ra, was depicted with the head of a ram. Khnum was a god of creation, also known as the Divine Potter, who molded children from the clay of the Nile.\\n* The golden apple and ankh: The stylized ankh, the Egyptian symbol for life and reproduction, stands for masculine virility. The Emperor holds the ankh in his right hand—the hand associated with giving. In his left hand, he shows what he receives: the golden apple, symbol of love and sexuality associated with the Roman goddess Venus. Venus\\'s symbol appears on the Empress, the Emperor\\'s partner. In this way the ankh and apple denote their relationship and the male and female archetypes.\\n* Armour: The armour is a symbol of strength, defense, and action in the world. Battle is a quality of the planet Mars, ruler of the Emperor\\'s sign of Aries. See this symbol on card VII, The Chariot.\\n\\n* The red cloak: energy and action; being in the material world. See this symbol on card I, The Magician; V, The Hierophant; and XI, Justice.\\n\\n* The crown: A power symbol, the Emperor\\'s crown sits on the crown chakra of the head, the connection point with the higher self. It shows autonomy and self-direction. The crown is closed, showing the Emperor\\'s self-containment and self-reliance. See variants of the crown on II, The High Priestess; III, The Empress; V, The Hierophant; VII, The Chariot; VIII, Strength; XI, Justice; XVI, The Tower; the Six of Wands; the Ace of Swords; the Four of Pentacles; and the Kings and Queens of the minor arcana suits.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL EMPEROR: WENCESLAS AND CHARLEMAGNE\\n\\nOne of The Emperor\\'s historical emblems is the black eagle, which appears on his hat in the Visconti-Sforza tarots (see page 10)—the bird was an insignia of the Visconti family and the Holy Roman Empire, which gave the family official permission to bear it. The historical Emperor may be Wenceslas of Bohemia (1205–1253), who married into the family of Roman Emperor Frederick I; other sources suggest the original Emperor may be Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor (c. 742-814). The Marseilles tarot (1701-1715) shows the Emperor side-on, just as we would see the profile of kings and other dignitaries on coins and playing cards.\\n\\n# THE EMPEROR\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Emperor in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Four of Pentacles, for for financial stability\\n* The King of Cups, for love and intuition—the heart aspect\\n* The King of Pentacles, for generosity and security—the physical body\\n* The King of Swords, for the intellect—the mind aspect\\n* The King Wands, for creativity and communication—the soul aspect\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE EMPEROR: KNOWING YOUR BOUNDARIES\\n\\nTake the Emperor from your deck and lay him before you in the center of the spread, as shown. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan the cards out facedown. Choose four cards with your left hand and place them around the Emperor, as shown. You could ask, \"Should I consider moving house?\" or \"How can I feel more secure?\"\\n\\n* **Card 1:** You/your situation\\n* **Card 2:** Past issues\\n* **Card 3:** Hopes or fears\\n* **Card 4:** Outcome\\n\\n```\\n     [3]     [4]\\n       Emperor\\n     [1]     [2]\\n\\n```\\n| Card #  | Position                 | Meaning                                                                   |\\n| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Emperor | **Significator**         | Represents structure, stability, authority, and personal boundaries       |\\n| 1       | **You / Your Situation** | Current context; how you perceive or experience your situation            |\\n| 2       | **Past Issues**          | History or past patterns influencing your need for boundaries or security |\\n| 3       | **Hopes or Fears**       | Inner desires or worries about stability, power, or control               |\\n| 4       | **Outcome**              | Probable result if current path or mindset continues                      |\\n---\\n\\n# V THE HIEROPHANT\\n\\nAlternative Names: The High Priest, The Pope\\nNumber: V\\nNumerology Link: IV, Temperance\\nAstrological Sign or Planet: Taurus the Bull\\nElement: Earth\\nHebrew Letter: Vau (Vav, Wav)\\nSymbol: Nail or connector\\nMeaning: Kindness\\nTree of Life Pathway: Sixth, Chesed and Chockmah\\nChakra: Causal, or fourth eye, for spiritual connection\\nKey Meanings: Education, unity, spiritual and direction\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE HIEROPHANT\\n\\nThe Hierophant appears as a figure of religious orthodoxy. Wearing the papal crown and holding the scepter, he makes the hand gesture of blessing to two supplicants kneeling before him. He is the leader of the Catholic faith and symbolizes unity. One of his titles, Pontifex Maximus, means \"The Great Bridge-Builder\"; he is the bridge between heaven and earth. He shows us the potential for integrating our internal and external worlds, bringing together body and soul, as well as our male and female self-aspects. As the priest, he officiates at weddings, joining two people together in physical and spiritual union.\\n\\nThe Hierophant is also a symbol of education. Also know as the Priest or the Pope, in the Rider-Waite tarot, he is named Hierophant after the *hierophantes*, or priests who guarded the Eleusinian Mysteries (see The Historical Hierophant). Through him, we may find and follow a higher path through learning. He may be a lecturer or inspiring leader, priest or magus, shaman or established esoteric teacher.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the Hierophant appears between card IV, The Emperor, and VI, The Lovers. We are moving from the Emperor\\'s worldly domain to an encounter with the spiritual through a teacher-priest. After the Hierophant, we meet the Lovers and see God\\'s messenger, Archangel Raphael, and then—through the sequence of these three cards—sense a progression from the earth realm to a glimpse of the divine.\\n\\nThe Hierophant\\'s number is the indivisible V, the number of mankind, which indicates that he is the communicator between man and God, which is also shown by his hand gesture, symbolizing heaven and earth (see The Hierophant\\'s Symbols). He is numerologically linked with card XIV, Temperance (14; 1 + 4 = 5, or V). The Angel of Temperance and the Hierophant are both channels for the message of God.\\n\\n# THE HIEROPHANT\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Hierophant\\'s sign is Taurus, the Bull the second sign of the zodiac (April 21-May 21), ruled by sensuous planet Venus and the element of Earth, which is also represented by his red robes (see The Hierophant\\'s Symbols). This fixed sign of the zodiac has the attributes of commitment and loyalty, groundedness, and practicality.\\n\\n# THE HIEROPHANT AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Hierophant\\'s kabbalistic letter is Vau, meaning nail or connector—the Hebrew letter resembles an I with a pen stroke to the left. Vau\\'s esoteric meaning is kindness. On the Tree of Life, he is placed on the sixth pathway between the spheres of Chesed, meaning mercy and divine love, and Chockmah, or wisdom and the male principle. Chockmah is also known as the Father of Fathers and points to the Hierophant as the eternal father-god, spiritual counterpart to the mother-goddess embodied in card III, The Empress.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nIn the upright position, the Hierophant shows support, self-realization, and expansion. This is a time to develop emotionally and spiritually—to commit to relationships; to think and philosophize; and to become more spiritually aware. In this way, the Hierophant offers an opportunity to integrate mind and spirit and ascend to a higher plane of awareness. Day to day, this means nurturing your talents through learning and heeding good advice. While the Hierophant offers wise counsel, he does represent institutions and traditional values—which may be a comfort to you or a test of how much you are willing to conform. Even if his conventions are not for you, the Hierophant offers an opportunity to question and define your values. As a spiritual leader, the Hierophant shows you the path to follow in a community, such as joining a study group or class through which you may learn a new skill. He also represents good judgment and fairness: The Hierophant asks you to tune your moral compass, so if you have been questioning a decision, it is time to do what is right.\\n\\nHere\\'s what else the Hierophant can symbolize:\\n\\n* **Home:** Expanding your current property; inviting people into your home to share your interests\\n* **Relationships:** Committed partnerships; marriage; celebrating the sacred in your relationship\\n* **Career and money:** Progress in your organization; direction and decisions; inspired leadership and growth\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, the Hierophant shows poor leadership. You may be mislead by an incompetent or egotistic individual at work or on your spiritual path. This is the card of the bad guru—the judgmental teacher who is more interested in furthering his ambitions than supporting you in yours. In work, the Hierophant reversed can also show institutions that need restructuring: poor advice, mistrust, and wrong decisions with moral repercussions. It is better to seek your own path than to stay with a mentor or plan that doesn\\'t suit your needs. Be a free spirit.\\n\\n# HIS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nMake the most of your gifts.\\n\\n# THE HIEROPHANT\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Hierophant appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The papal crown: The triple crown is the symbol of papal authority. Its three layers stand for the holy trinity.\\n* The papal staff, or crosier: The three crosses on the Hierophant\\'s staff stand for the Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; earth, heaven, and the spirit world; and the self, higher self, and the Christ/fully actualized self. We also see the three crosses on the Hierophant\\'s papal robes, which are red, for earth, while the crosier is gold, for heaven.\\n* The crossed keys: The golden crossed keys represent the keys to the kingdom of heaven given by Jesus to St. Peter. Jesus said to Peter, \"Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.\" Heaven and earth are as one, a reminder of the Hierophant\\'s key meaning of unity.\\n* The hand gesture of blessing: The blessing shows two fingers bent and two extended, representing what is seen and what is hidden from view—our visible earthly existence and the invisible heaven. The fingers are part of the same hand and, like the crossed keys, illustrate how our known and unknown worlds unite.\\n\\n* The red cloak: Energy and action; being in the material world. See this symbol on cards I, The Magician; IV, The Emperor; and XI, Justice.\\n\\n* The roses and lilies: The red roses symbolize love and the white lilies, purity. See this symbol on cards I, The Magician; the roses around the waist of the maiden on VIII, Strength; and red roses on the gown of card III, The Empress.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL HIEROPHANT: SECRET RITES\\n\\nThe Hierophant was named in the Rider-Waite tarot after *hierophant*, a general term meaning someone who introduced others to holiness—*hierophant* in Greek was *ta hiera* and *phainen*, meaning to show. Hierophantes was also the title of the High Priests of the Greek religion of Eleusis, who officiated at the Eleusinian Mysteries. This was a famous initiation ceremony and festival that took place at Eleusis, near Athens. The rites were secret, but involved the afterlife and the retelling of the story of Demeter the grain mother and her daughter, Persephone, who was abducted by Hades (see the Empress, page 42). The Hierophant was always chosen from a family named Eumolpidae, who had a mythical ancestor, Eumolpus, whose parents were the gods Poseidon and Chione. The Hierophant was the keeper of sacred mysteries, and he was renowned for his beautiful and hypnotic voice—which perhaps explains the emphasis on listening in many Hierophant card interpretations.\\n\\nIn early tarot cards, the Hierophant card was the Pope. The card\\'s title changed in some seventeenth- and eighteenth-century decks in response to religious sensitivity. For example, Jupiter replaced the Pope in the Tarot de Besancon of 1818, and Bacchus, god of wine, is the Pope of the Belgian tarot of 1770.\\n\\n# THE HIEROPHANT\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of The Hierophant in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Nine of Wands, for defending your faith at any cost; protecting what is known\\n* The Six of Cups, for familiarity, harmony, and the past\\n* The Two of Cups, for love partnerships\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE HIEROPHANT: FINDING A MENTOR OR SOUL MATE\\n\\n\\nTake the Hierophant from your deck and lay him before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose three cards with your left hand and place them around the Hierophant as shown. You could ask, \"Will I find a mentor at this time?\" or \"Will I have a soul connection with this person?\" Interpret card 3, the outcome, using the yes/no list of major arcana cards on page 23.\\n\\n* **Card 1:** Your situation\\n* **Card 2:** The mentor you need or the person in question\\n* **Card 3:** The outcome\\n\\n```\\n[CARD 1]   [The Hierophant]   [CARD 2]\\n               |\\n            [CARD 3]\\n\\n```\\n| Card #         | Position                    | Meaning                                                          |\\n| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| The Hierophant | **Significator**            | Represents guidance, wisdom, institutional or spiritual support  |\\n| 1              | **Your Situation**          | Where you are now in your quest for guidance or connection       |\\n| 2              | **The Mentor or Soul Mate** | The person or type of energy that may serve as a mentor/partner  |\\n| 3              | **The Outcome**             | The likely result or answer—useful for **yes/no** interpretation |\\n\\n---\\n\\n# VI THE LOVERS\\n\\nAlternative Names: The Lover, Love\\nNumber: VI\\nNumerology Link: XV, The Devil\\nAstrological Sign or Planet: Gemini the Twins\\nElement: Air\\nHebrew Letter: Zain\\nSymbol: Sword\\nMeaning: Soulfulness\\nTree of Life Pathway: Seventh, between Tiphareth and Binah\\nChakra: Heart chakra, for love and healing\\nKey Meanings: Love and relationships, maturity, and decisions\\n\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE LOVERS\\n\\nTwo Lovers arrive in a magical garden where strange flowers bloom and snakes talk. The full sun beams behind a luminous Archangel Raphael, angel of love and healing, who presides over their union. The Lovers stand in the Garden of Eden together, yet the woman, Eve, is gazing up at Archangel Raphael, who is holding up his right hand, explaining to them that they will be cast out of the garden if they eat the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Their innocent paradise will end—a metaphor for the seeming perfection of a new relationship before we must negotiate the practicalities. The man, Adam—who could also be the Fool on his journey through the tarot—gazes directly at Eve. They may be called the Lovers, but they are not Lovers yet: See the clouds between them? The clouds predict the Fall and the hurdles they will overcome as their relationship becomes grounded in reality. All looks perfect in Eden, but Eve and Adam are only just about to recognize each other and know love. From this point onward, we know the snake will tempt Eve to eat the fruit, and their relationship will change forever. In the major arcana sequence, the Lovers arrive after card V, The Hierophant. One of his meanings is marriage and the integration of male and female aspects. After the Lovers comes card VII, The Chariot—we have made our love decision, and the tension released drives us forward. The Lovers\\' number is VI, the number of harmony, love, and growth. It is also associated with healing and so links with the healing Archangel Raphael. The card\\'s numerological link is XV, The Devil, who stands for the shadow side of love, when issues of control and possessiveness take hold.\\n\\n# THE LOVERS\\' ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Lovers\\' sign is Gemini, the Twins (May 22–June 21), or the dual aspects of male and female, light and shadow. Loving our whole selves, in all our aspects, raises our consciousness to love God/the universe/the Great Spirit as the creator of the divine spark within. Eve is also Adam\\'s twin, as she was created from him.\\n\\n# THE LOVERS AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Lovers\\' Hebrew letter is Zain, or sword—it can also connote the penis. As swords are the suit of Air in the tarot and symbolize clear thought and action, this relates to the card\\'s meaning of decisions. The tarotist Jonathan Dee also comments, \"It is also interesting to note that Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden [of Eden] by an angel with a sword.\" Zain can also mean soulfulness or living with an awareness of our higher selves. The Lovers is placed on the seventh pathway on the Tree of Life between the spheres of Tiphareth, for beauty, rebirth, and ascending consciousness, and Binah, for understanding, the goddess, and the female principle.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEAING\\nThe Lovers show relationships and a decision. The card can predict meeting a new partner or a career opportunity, and your choice now will have a significant effect on your future. In the upright position, the person coming into your orbit now has a positive influence and offers true love—provided you follow the guidance of your heart rather than your head. If you are willing to take a risk rather than stay with a safe choice, you may soon discover your own Garden of Eden, which is fertile and rich with possibility. If you are already in a relationship, a decision whether to take your partnership to a deeper level will be made. The issue that the Lovers card raises is your ability to make a decision based on your long-term future rather than short-term gains. In this way, you are being asked to make a mature decision that supports your true needs—respect, intimacy, love, and trust—and to connect with a partner who is emotionally available to you. Whatever your situation, the message is to follow your heart\\'s desire. An additional meaning of the Lovers card is a young person leaving home and making independent decisions.\\n\\n* **Home:** If you\\'re not living in your dream home, now is the time to work toward a property and location that will support your dreams and desires.\\n* **Relationships:** A love decision—Look at your patterns in previous relationships and see what your current love, or prospective new partner, can offer you that is different and ultimately more fulfilling. If you are single, love yourself first to manifest the right relationship when the time comes.\\n* **Career and money:** Career choices—One option may seem easier, but look carefully to ensure you are making the best decision in the long term. Look beyond money to your future development and ambitions.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Lovers card reverses, relationships go out of balance and the shadow side of your personalities enters the equation. A relationship is in crisis, and you may question your initial attraction as the values you once held as a couple feel corrupted. There may be inequality, betrayal, and dishonesty. The Lovers reversed is also an aspect of card XV, The Devil, which reveals lust, materialism, and addiction to negative patterns.\\n\\n# THEIR WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nFollow the wisdom of your heart.\\n\\n# THE LOVERS\\' SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Lovers appear with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* Archangel Raphael: The archangel of love and healing symbolizes spiritual wisdom and the healing power of love. Following the heart and committing to love as a life purpose heals us and heals others. See other Archangels on XIV Temperance (Archangel Michael), and XX Judgment (Archangel Gabriel).\\n\\n* The Tree of Life: Find this on the right of the card, behind the man; it stands for the male principle. It has twelve fruits representing the twelve signs of the zodiac.\\n\\n* The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil: You can see this on the left of the card, behind the woman; it stands for the female principle. The tree\\'s fruit is sexual experience.\\n\\n* The snake: Risk and wisdom—In Christianity, it is the Fall of Man: Adam and Eve\\'s banishment from Eden when they ate the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL LOVERS: WEDDINGS AND AFFAIRS\\n\\nIn Renaissance Italy, the Visconti family commissioned an artist to paint a set of tarot cards to commemorate the marriage of Bianca Maria Visconti and Francesco Sforza, and the joining together of two of the most powerful families in Northern Italy. Married in 1441, portraits of Bianca and Francesco were painted on the Lovers card, in which they are shown holding hands under a canopy decorated with heraldic shields and symbols with a blind cupid hovering above. The Visconti-Sforza tarots were almost a family album, featuring not only Bianca Maria and Francesco, but Bianca Maria again on the Chariot and Sister Manfreda, believed to be a relative of the Visconti family, as the High Priestess (see page 40).\\n\\nIn the Marseilles tarots, which may date from the fifteenth century, we see three people—two women and a man in the center. Cupid, who is not blindfolded, is about to shoot love\\'s arrow at the couple on the right—indicating that the man will have to choose one of the women as his partner. In the tarots of Court de Gébelin (Antoine Court, 1725-1784), which appeared in his book *Le Monde Primitif* (1781), cupid favors the couple on the left of the card. The French occultist Etteilla (Jean-Baptiste Alliette, 1738-1791) created a deck with a different structure to that of traditional tarot, but with a card equivalent to the Lovers numbered 13 and named \"Mariage,\" or marriage. Here, the central figure is a priest conducting a wedding ceremony. A. E. Waite\\'s card holds this structure of three people, but transformed the priest or cupid into the angel and draws upon the Lovers\\' biblical lineage as Adam and Eve.\\n\\n# THE LOVERS\\' REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Lovers in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Ace of Cups, for love\\n* The Two of Cups, for a new partnership\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE LOVERS: THE LOVE DECISION\\n\\nTake the Lovers card from your deck and lay the card before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose six cards with your left hand and place them around the Lovers, as shown. You could ask, \"What are my choices, and how do I choose?\"\\n\\n* **Card 1:** The question\\n* **Card 2:** Background to the present situation\\n* **Cards 3 and 4:** The choices\\n* **Card 5:** The best action to take\\n* **Card 6:** The outcome\\n\\n```\\n        [6] ← Outcome\\n     [3]   [4] ← The choices\\n  [2] The Lovers [5] ← Best action to take\\n        [1] ← The question\\n```\\n| Card # | Position                        | Meaning                                                             |\\n| ------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Lovers | **Significator**                | Central focus: love, harmony, values, or romantic/ethical decisions |\\n| 1      | **The Question**                | What you’re truly asking or exploring; the core concern             |\\n| 2      | **Background to the Situation** | Past influences or context shaping the present relationship dynamic |\\n| 3 & 4  | **The Choices**                 | Two options, paths, or people—what each represents                  |\\n| 5      | **The Best Action to Take**     | Advice or insight into how to proceed with clarity                  |\\n| 6      | **The Outcome**                 | Likely result or emotional/relationship consequence of your choice  |\\n---\\n\\n# VII THE CHARIOT\\n\\nAlternative Name: Victory\\nNumber: VII\\nNumerological Link: XVI, The Tower\\nAstrological Sign or Planet: Cancer the Crab\\nElement: Water\\nHebrew Letter: Heth (Chet, Cheth)\\nSymbol: Fence or enclosure\\nMeaning: Guidance\\nTree of Life Pathway: Eighth, between Geburah and Binah\\nChakra: Throat, for truth\\nKey Meanings: Determination, victory, and a journey\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE CHARIOT\\n\\nThe Chariot—or the charioteer—is the traveler, standing strong in his carriage of stone and flanked by two resting sphinxes. With the city and its river behind him, he is about to move on; with determination and self-control, he will keep his vehicle on the road and be successful in his quest. At this point, his concerns are practical and material rather than mystical, yet he is aware of the heavenly realms above him, shown by his canopy of stars and the astrological symbols on his belt.\\n\\nThe Chariot is a culmination of the cards that precede him, and some symbols from cards 0 to VI are included on the card as evidence. About to embark on a journey, the Chariot echoes the youth aspect of the Fool. On the Chariot’s shoulder armor are crescent moons, for II, The High Priestess. His starry crown is like that of III, The Empress. The stone chariot resembles the Emperor’s throne, and its pillars those of the Hierophant’s chamber. The landscape evokes the Garden of Eden, home to card VI, The Lovers. The charioteer will soon find his karmic life path. To stay on it, he needs to draw together all his past experiences.\\n\\nIndivisible by any other number, VII is a number of unification, mirrored in the seven days of the week, the days of the creation of the universe, and, in classical wisdom, the then-seven planets of the solar system. Seven is also the sum of three and four, which tells us that the Chariot is the child of cards III and IV, the Empress and Emperor, wearing his mother’s crown and standing astride his father’s throne. His numerological correspondence is card XVI, The Tower. The shadow side of the Chariot is ego—which leads to destruction, or the Tower.\\n\\n# THE CHARIOT\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Chariot’s astrological sign is Cancer the Crab (June 22-July 23), ruled by the moon. The crab has a shell, a protective vehicle for the body, like the chariot itself. The Charioteer’s gauntlets have a shell-like frill at the forearms.\\n\\nThe card also indicates the four fixed signs of Aquarius, Scorpio, Leo, and Taurus and their elements, which are symbolized by the sphinx.\\n\\n# THE CHARIOT AND KABBALA\\n\\n\\nThe Chariot\\'s Hebrew letter is Chet, for fence or enclosure, a descriptor of the vehicle itself. The symbol of the square on the charioteer\\'s breastplate may also reference the square form of the Hebrew letter Mem, which, in the ancient kabbalistic text the *Sefer Yetzirah*, means King over Water and Formed Earth in the Universe—suggesting the Chariot\\'s crossing of the river and reaching dry land, from where he commences his journey. In the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the Chariot is positioned on the eighth pathway between the spheres of Geburah, power and destruction, and Binah, meaning understanding and the female principle or creation.\\n\\n## UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Upright Chariot signifies success and a major departure. This is a time for determination and focus as you travel in a new direction. A decision is made, and now you can begin to experience real progress in your affairs. Ready to take control and navigate your path, you are poised to learn as your horizons rapidly expand. Just as the charioteer has his wand to drive him onward, you will need willpower to fuel your desires. The Chariot can indicate a move or an important journey, and, on a mundane level, it shows you driving a car on your travels or getting a new vehicle. Following are some other possibilities:\\n\\n* **Home:** Travel away from home is the focus now, rather than on extending or improving your home. You may also welcome travelers from other states or countries. Any disagreements with those you live with will be quickly overcome.\\n* **Relationships:** A relationship progresses at a pace; if the cards around the Chariot show endings, you may be moving on alone—but this is your rightful path.\\n* **Career and money:** Swift progress in business affairs—the opportunity coming your way will be challenging and exciting. Financially, you are on the road to success.\\n\\n## REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, there is arrogance and self-indulgence. This can show a person or event spiraling out of control. Ego is at work and selfish needs come before  the\\tgreater\\tgood,\\tso\\tthe\\tChariot\\treversed\\tcan\\tindicate\\trecklessness\\tand\\tpoor leadership.\\tWhen\\tthe\\tChariot\\treverses\\tand\\tis\\ttipped\\toff\\tthe\\troad,\\ttravel\\tplans\\tand house\\tmoves\\tare\\tdisrupted\\tor\\tdelayed.\\n\\n# HIS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nTake charge and reach for the stars.\\n\\n# THE CHARIOT\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Chariot appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The chariot: The vehicle for the personality and self-expression; protection and progress\\n* The black and white sphinxes: The sphinx is a symbol of unity in diversity because it embodies a human face, eagle wings, the body of a lion, and the tail of a bull, which relate also to the four elements, the four suits of the minor arcana, and the four fixed signs of the zodiac (see The Chariot\\'s Astrology). See this symbol on card X, The Wheel of Fortune.\\n* The armor and breastplate: The charioteer\\'s armor symbolizes protection on his journey. On his breastplate, the alchemical symbol of the square signifies the four corners of the earth. The moon faces on the shoulder armor represent the divination stones, urmin and thummin, which in the Old Testament were used to divine God\\'s will; it is suggested that the stones were cast to answer to a serious matter, such the decision to go to war.\\n* The robes: The written characters on the charioteer\\'s robe are protective talismans. On the belt are some undefined symbols, believed to be signs of the zodiac.\\n* The crown: This is a symbol of authority. This crown has an eight-pointed star—this is the star from card XVII, The Star, a symbol of hope (see page 98). A laurel wreath is worn underneath it, symbolizing victory. See this symbol on III, The Empress, and XVII, The Star.\\n* The winged sun disk: The winged sun belonged to the Egyptian god Horus and later to the sun god, Ra; the symbol may also relate to the Greek sun god, Helios, who rode the skies in his sun chariot. In this card, the symbol denotes solar power and the conscious mind.\\n\\n* Yoni-lingham: This Hindu symbol, under the wing emblem on the front of the chariot, shows the feminine organ, the yoni, and the male lingam, pictured joined to symbolize the harmonious union of male and female aspects.\\n\\n* The canopy of stars: This is a symbol of hope and direction and a link with the celestial realms, seen also on the zodiac symbols on the charioteer\\'s belt. See this symbol on card XVII, The Star.\\n\\n* The magic wand: Power, creativity, and initiative See this symbol on card I, The Magician, and XXI, The World.\\n\\n* Yellow background: Consciousness, clear sight, and support See this symbol on card I, The Magician; III, The Empress; VIII, Strength; and XI, Justice.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL CHARIOT: THE PROCESSION OF TRIUMPHS\\n\\nThe Chariot dates back to the victory parades of ancient Rome, when victors processed through the streets in their triumphal chariot—triumph, from which the word trump (_trionfi_) is derived, also another term for the major arcana cards of the tarot. The charioteer of this parade of heroes was probably recognized by the Roman spectators as their sun god, Sol, shown by the bright yellow sunlight on the Rider-Waite card. The people of Renaissance Italy continued this tradition, known as the procession of triumphs, during which allegorical figures appeared in triumphal carts to represent all the major arcana cards. The Visconti-Sforza tarot of the fifteenth century shows a chariot pulled by two white winged horses and in it a queen resembling Bianca Maria Visconti, the woman in the Lovers card (see The Historical Lovers, page 56).\\n\\n# THE CHARIOT\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Chariot in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Three of Wands, for broadening horizons and travel\\n* The Eight of Wands, for travel and communication\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE CHARIOT: MOVING ON\\n\\nTake the Chariot from your deck and lay the card in the center of the spread, as shown. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose seven cards with your left hand and place them around the Chariot, as shown.

She stays in control by holding her position, symbolized by the infinity symbol above her head. The lion signifies passion and base instincts, and the woman, civility. Although her position is precarious, she does not show fear. She communicates with the lion through her calm presence; she is not denying his power. In this way, one of the card\\'s messages is having the courage to listen to and accept our shadow voices, our own emotional turmoil, without the fear that it will eat us up. Yet Strength personified does more than hold on: She transmutes the beast\\'s fierce energy to a higher purpose. As one of the four cardinal virtue cards of the major arcana sequence (see page 75), Strength implies a moral victory.\\n\\nAs a mediator of opposite qualities, Strength is not dissimilar to card II, The High Priestess, who stands between earth and the spirit world; V, The Hierophant, who intercedes between heaven and earth; and VII, The Chariot, who precedes her in the major arcana sequence, in which the charioteer reins in the light and dark aspects of the self. Although apparent rivals, these opposites derive from one source and, like the yin-yang symbol, are in essence each other. Armed with Strength\\'s experience, card IX, The Hermit, is bold enough to go into the wilderness alone to find himself intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.\\n\\nStrength\\'s number, VIII, stands for stability and renewal and was first assigned to the card by the Golden Dawn card correspondences. In earlier tarots, she was numbered XI, or the digits 11, for duality, and so links to II, The High Priestess. Strength as VIII is numerologically linked with card XVII, The Star (17, as 1 + 7 = 8). This too is a card of hope and high intention.\\n\\n# STRENGTH\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nStrength\\'s zodiac sign is Leo the Lion (July 24-August 23), a natural alignment as the lion is shown on the card. The card\\'s element is dynamic Fire, linked with energy and enterprise.\\n\\n# STRENGTH AND KABBALA\\n\\nStrength\\'s kabbalistic letter is Teth, meaning courage, as well as serpent or snake, referencing the wisdom of experience. The astrological glyph for Strength\\'s sign of Leo resembles a snake. On the Tree of Life, Strength is placed on the ninth pathway between the spheres of Geburah and Chesed, meaning power linked with universal love and order. In Strength, we maintain order, despite the potential for chaos.\\n\\n## UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nStrength shows that you turn to your higher self for self-guidance; she also demonstrates strength of character when dealing with pressure. Courage, determination, and patience are needed now, as it is time to get a situation—or individual—under control. You will need to act with grace and sensitivity, however, rather than using brute force. This is a good card for leadership, as it signifies you are ready to take on a challenge and stand firm; others may resist, but be consistent in your actions and results will come. In creative projects, Strength shows you taking a raw idea and developing it. You refine it without sacrificing its spirit or depleting your energy. This concept may take physical form as a document, piece of artwork, or prototype.\\n\\nOn a psychological level, Strength shows the integration of masculine and feminine traits and finding balance between the two. In terms of health, Strength shows resilience and vitality, recovery from illness, and the willpower to break bad habits.\\n\\nHere are some specifics:\\n\\n* **Home:** There\\'s a need to support and direct those with strong opinions. You may need to take the role of mediator.\\n* **Relationships:** The need for balance—there is a danger that physical attraction masks emotional or other commitment issues that need to be addressed. This card is also a message of hope if your relationship has been tested, as the situation will soon improve.\\n* **Career and money:** Tension at work—Resolution comes gently and without force.\\n\\n## REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, Strength turns to weakness of will and avoidance of risk, conflicts, and decision-making. This can refer to you ignoring your instincts  altogether\\tor\\tallowing\\tfear\\tof\\tconflict\\tto\\tstop\\tyou\\tfrom\\ttaking\\taction.\\tThis avoidance\\tis\\tholding\\tback\\tyour\\tpersonal\\tgrowth;\\tin\\tthis\\tsituation,\\tyou\\tcan\\tonly learn\\tthrough\\texperience.\\tWhatever\\tyou\\tresist\\tpersists,\\tso\\ttake\\tcharge\\tand\\ttake on\\tthe\\tchallenge.

Some of them reappear in other cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The lemniscate, or infinity symbol: Balance, activity, and renewal—The flow of this never-ending symbol also suggests consistency and patience. The eight-shape mirrors VIII, Strength\\'s number.\\nSee this symbol on card I, The Magician.\\n\\n* The lion: The lion is a universal symbol of power, courage, majesty, and leadership.

Some are stories of healing, such as the fairytale beauty and the beast. Another example is the classical fable of Androcles, a fugitive slave who heals the paw of a wounded lion. Androcles is later recaptured and condemned to public death by mauling by a lion. Yet the lion Androcles faces in the stadium is his old friend, who recognizes Androcles and refuses to kill him. The slave is given his freedom by the Emperor of Rome, and man and lion parade the streets together in celebration. Flowers are strewn upon them—echoed, perhaps, in the rose garlands shown on our Rider-Waite Strength card.\\n\\nIn other myths, taking on the lion shows our power over nature. The huntress Cyrene, the \"girl lionkiller\" according to Greek poet Nonnus, killed many a beast to protect her father\\'s cattle; her exploits caught the attention of the god Apollo, who fell in love with her. The Visconti-Sforza tarots of the Renaissance show Hercules with a raised club, defeating the terrifying lion of Nemea. He brought the animal\\'s skin back to King Eurystheus, and with this trophy proved he had succeeded in his first labor.\\n\\nThe Griggoneur tarot cards of the mid-fifteenth century include an unusual Strength card: a courtly lady sitting comfortably holding a broken pillar. It\\'s unclear if she is supporting the two pieces, stopping them from falling, or actually breaking the pillar. This image may relate to Samson\\'s destruction of the temple of the Philistines or the legend of the Pillars of Hercules, which, according to Plato, guarded the entry to the mysterious lost world of Atlantis. This was the border of civilization, so this lady and her pillar may symbolize the defense of boundaries. She is literally a pillar of strength.\\n\\nIn the Tarot of Marseilles (1701–1715), we see a woman restraining the lion\\'s jaws and wearing a wide floppy hat—the brim makes the shape of the leminscate, or infinity symbol, shown also on the Rider-Waite card (see Strength\\'s Symbols).\\n\\n# STRENGTH\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of Strength in these minor arcana cards:\\n* The Seven of Wands, for endurance\\n* The Nine of Wands, for relentless effort\\n* The Ace of Swords, for decisiveness\\n* The Eight of Pentacles, for commitment\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH STRENGTH: A TEST OF COURAGE\\n\\nTake Strength from your deck and lay the card before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose five cards with your left hand and place them around Strength, as shown.

Inside his lantern is a glowing star, a symbol of guidance that lights his way ahead. The Hermit needs privacy, time for silence and discretion, so he can think and plan. He may be in the wilderness, but this space is essential to him. In this way, the Hermit tells us it is time to go it alone, to break with convention and find our soul\\'s path.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the Hermit appears after VIII, Strength, and before X, The Wheel of Fortune. Having learned the lessons of Strength, he takes time out to contemplate his experiences. The Hermit can be seen as the Fool grown, the youth now as an old man, and his arrival marks the near-end of the first half of the tarot journey marked by X, The Wheel of Fortune. In the second half of the major arcana cycle, the material world fades and the spiritual quest beckons.\\n\\nThe Hermit\\'s number is IX, or three groups of dynamic three. The Hermit needs time to integrate his experience in mind, body, and soul. Nine is also the last single-digit number in the major arcana sequence and a pause in activity before he aligns with fate, symbolized by the Wheel of Fortune. The Hermit is numerologically linked with card XVIII, The Moon (18; 1 + 8 = 9)—a card of imagination and self-reflection.\\n\\n# THE HERMIT\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Hermit\\'s zodiac sign is Virgo the Virgin. It suggests the Hermit has this attribute—perhaps he is a chaste monk. The Hermit\\'s number, IX, gives us the ninth month of the year, September, and the sign of Virgo (August 23–September 22).\\n\\n# THE HERMIT AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe kabbalistic letter of the Hermit is Yod, which means hand and also prudence. Yod is the foundation of all other letters in the Hebrew alphabet, just as the Hermit\\'s retreat helps him establish his priorities.\\n\\nOn the Tree of Life, the Hermit is placed on the tenth pathway between Chesed and Tiphareth, or love and beauty aligned with salvation.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThere\\'s an opportunity to take time away from routine to consider your options or advance a personal project. This card can show you enjoying solitude, as you need space to process your thoughts and feelings. The Hermit can show a physical journey, but more commonly he represents a state of mind in which you wisely withdraw and keep your own counsel. It can show breaking with tradition and finding a unique approach to a challenge. You may appreciate a mentor, and when you are ready, as the saying goes, the teacher will appear. Until that time, you have yourself to rely upon, and you do have the answers; all you need is the mental space to connect with your inner wisdom. If you are under pressure to make a decision, the Hermit shows you need more time.\\n\\nThere is also a healing aspect to the Hermit, and the card can appear in a reading to show self-healing and healing others. You may need to guide others and show them the way forward. Even if you are not entirely sure you can help, you are equipped to do so.\\n\\nThe Hermit can also indicate the following:\\n\\n* **Home:** Consider all your options carefully and avoid making big decisions at present. Prioritize your tasks and focus on planning rather than immediate action.\\n* **Relationships:** Take time to invest in your current relationship or to work on your relationship with yourself. The card can also show a period of being single.\\n* **Career and money:** Take a different approach and stand back. You may be drawn to research and professional development courses now. A mentor may guide you.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen reversed, you may be feeling alone and unsupported. However, this is more an attitude than reality, so it\\'s worth asking yourself if you are avoiding help. The card can also show accepting a role—perhaps victim or martyr—that you find hard to let go of due to habit or stubbornness. Alternatively, the card can show a time when you are cut off from your usual support systems or have been unfriended by those you trusted. If this chimes for you, go with the upright card meaning and withdraw for a while, relying on your own guidance.\\n\\n# HIS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nLive quietly for a time.\\n\\n# THE HERMIT\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Hermit appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The staff: The staff symbolizes self-support. In some decks, the staff is entwined by a snake, making a single spiral to form the Rod of Asclepius, a signifier for the Greek deity of healing.\\n* The lantern: A sign of the divine light within that illuminates our life path\\n* The six-pointed star: The star is a mark of hope and guidance. Its six points comprise two triangles—heaven and earth, or man and God, in unity. It is also a symbol of Saturn, god of agriculture and time, the Hermit\\'s ancestor (see The Historical Hermit). See this symbol on card XVII, The Star, and III, The Empress.\\n* The old man: The archetype of wisdom, the old man\\'s beard, hood, and downward gaze symbolize retreat and discretion.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL HERMIT: FATHER TIME\\n\\nOn the Renaissance Visconti-Sforza tarots, the Hermit is entitled \"The Old Man.\" On these and similar cards of that era, the hermit holds an hourglass in the traditional shape of the infinity symbol or lemniscate, illustrating the Hermit\\'s alternate name, Time. By the eighteenth century, however, the Hermit\\'s hourglass had become a lantern—a possible misinterpretation by later artists.\\n\\nThe Hermit is depicted differently in many cards. He is shown in cards of the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as an old man on crutches. In the Tarocchi of Mitelli (c. 1664) he has angel wings, suggesting he is facing death. On eighteenth-century minchiate cards, he is on crutches by a tomb with an hourglass, pierced by time\\'s arrow. Beside him is a stag, a Christ symbol. And later, by the twentieth century, we see the Hermit\\'s staff entwined with a snake in the shape of the Rod of Ascelpius, a symbol of the Greek god of healing.\\n\\nThere is also evidence that the Hermit was associated with the Roman god Saturn (rather than Mercury, ruler of his sign of Virgo). Saturn was an aspect of the Titan god Chronos, who ate his own children because he believed the prophesy that one of them would overthrow him—a grisly way to stop the passage of time. In the Tarocchi of Mantegna (c. 1470), card 47 is Saturno, a bearded man with a staff, just like our traditional Hermit.\\n\\nThe Hermit may also embody the tarot\\'s hidden virtue card of Prudence. It seems most likely that Prudence survived in modern decks as Justice (see page 79) or possibly the Hanged Man (page 78), but the Hermit may have first crept into the tarot in the Prudence card of the Tarocchi of Mantegna, a deck of fifty instructional cards that may be Florentine or Venetian in origin and date from around 1470. Prudence shows both an old bearded man and a young woman with a mirror and a dragon (which may have morphed into the snake shown on the Hermit on contemporary decks). The virtue of Prudence has survived in the meaning of the Hermit in his Hebrew letter, Yod, and in his meaning of discretion and careful planning.\\n\\n# THE HERMIT\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Hermit in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Seven of Wands, for standing alone and advocating your beliefs\\n* The Nine of Wands, for the need for protection\\n* The Nine of Pentacles, for independence and resourcefulness\\n* The Queen of Swords, for independence\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE HERMIT: THE HOURGLASS\\n\\nTake the Hermit from your deck and lay him before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose eight cards with your left hand and place them around the Hermit as shown. You could ask, \"What or whom do I need time out from?\" or \"What can I learn on my journey?\"\\n\\n* **Card 1:** Past events\\n* **Card 2:** The impact of the past\\n* **Card 3:** Your emotions\\n* **Card 4:** Your ambition\\n* **Card 5:** What holds you back\\n* **Card 6:** What will help you go forward\\n* **Card 7:** Hopes and dreams\\n* **Card 8:** Outcome\\n\\n```\\n   [7]     [8]       ← Hopes/Dreams & Outcome\\n [5]       [6]       ← What holds you back / What helps you forward\\n   [The Hermit]      ← Significator\\n [3]       [4]       ← Your emotions / Your ambition\\n   [1]     [2]       ← Past events / Their impact\\n\\n```\\n| Card #     | Position                   | Meaning                                                                |\\n| ---------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| The Hermit | **Significator**           | Inner wisdom, withdrawal, solitude, or spiritual reflection            |\\n| 1          | **Past Events**            | A key moment or situation in your past that shaped the current journey |\\n| 2          | **Impact of the Past**     | How that past event continues to affect you now                        |\\n| 3          | **Your Emotions**          | Your inner emotional state, conscious or subconscious                  |\\n| 4          | **Your Ambition**          | What you\\'re striving for or what motivates you                         |\\n| 5          | **What Holds You Back**    | Fears, doubts, or external obstacles limiting growth                   |\\n| 6          | **What Helps You Forward** | Strengths, allies, or circumstances that support progress              |\\n| 7          | **Hopes and Dreams**       | Ideal outcome, spiritual longing, or emotional desire                  |\\n| 8          | **Outcome**                | Where the journey may lead, or the result of reflection and effort     |\\n---\\n\\n\\n# X THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE\\n\\nAlternative Names: Fate, Destiny, The Wheel\\nNumber: X\\nNumerology Links: I, The Magician, and XIX, The Sun\\nAstrological Sign or Planet: Jupiter\\nElement: Fire\\nHebrew Letter: Kaph\\nSymbol: The palms of the hand, or cup\\nMeaning: Destiny\\nTree of Life Pathway: Eleventh, between Chesed and Netzach\\nChakra: Soul star, for soul connection\\nKey Meanings: Fate, change, intuition\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE\\n\\nFlanked by three animals and a winged figure, the Wheel appears between the clouds in blue sky, symbolizing hope, clarity, and a breakthrough on a spiritual path. With The Wheel in motion is destiny at work: Divine law rules.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the Wheel of Fortune as card X marks the halfway point in our tarot journey. We now turn from the outward-looking phase, which focuses on our relationship with the external world, to another phase that begins our inner, spiritual journey. We learn the lesson of Justice, are transformed by Death, meet the Angel of Temperance, and then encounter the Devil and the Tower of destruction. After all this, we ascend to the cosmos with the Star, Moon, and Sun, look back on our lives with Judgment, and celebrate our achievements with the World before returning to begin all over again with card 0, The Fool.\\n\\nThe Wheel has a numerological link with card I, The Magician (10 reduces to 1), and card XIX, The Sun, (19; 1 + 9 = 10). Read together, these three cards assume the ritual of a spell or cosmic order: We set a singular intention with the Magician, align our wishes with the Wheel of Fortune, and enjoy the outcome with the Sun.\\n\\n# THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Wheel corresponds to Jupiter, planet of luck, which rules religions and ideology, research and exploration. The angel and three animals around the wheel, embodied in the sphinx, can also be connected with the four elements and the fixed zodiac signs of Aquarius (the angel, element of Air), Taurus (bull, Earth), Scorpio (eagle, Water), and Leo (lion, Fire): They are shown on the Wheel as the primal elements of life.\\n\\n# THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Hebrew letter of the Wheel is Kaph, which means the palms of the hand and also destiny. On early tarot cards, a youth at the top of the Wheel is shown with one cupped hand.\\n\\nOn the Tree of Life, the Wheel is placed on the eleventh pathway between the spheres of Chesed, for law and love, and Netzach, for the forces of nature.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Wheel is upright, anything is possible—and usually positive. Chance meetings, unexpected offers, and news arrive in force. If life has been difficult recently, the Wheel shows a turn for the better. Under this influence, your intuitive powers heighten, and you may find yourself tuning in to people from the past—who magically reappear. This is also an auspicious card for communication with family and friends who live some distance away. Additionally, the Wheel reveals psychic ability, either within you or someone close, and a chance to discover all your hidden aspects—both light and dark. You can use the Wheel\\'s positive message wisely now to listen to your intuition and also to manifest your wishes, as your energy aligns with your guides, angels, and other spirit helpers who help you on your path. Your quest for knowledge is heightened now and, while you cannot control the forces of the universe, you can certainly come to a better understanding of your role within the universe.\\n\\nThe Wheel also suggests the following:\\n\\n* **Home:** An unexpected change in your living arrangements will happen; it will be surprising but beneficial in the long term.\\n* **Relationships:** An ex-partner or love interest comes back, but you will need to decide if this time your relationship will succeed. Don\\'t try to make it work; if it is right, love will go smoothly.\\n* **Career and money:** News is coming that will improve your situation. However, you will need to prioritize the demands upon yourself and quickly adapt to new challenges.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Wheel is reversed, you may suffer some bad luck, but thankfully this marks the end of a run of challenges. In this way, the simple interpretation of the reversed Wheel is closure. The benefits of the upright Wheel will come—it will just take a little longer to gather momentum and move you forward. On a spiritual level, this card can also show a lack of confidence in your intuitive messages or a false start when choosing a way to spiritually develop. Vow to adapt, begin again, and keep on working toward your goal.\\n\\n# ITS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nSurrender to fate.\\n\\n# THE WHEEL\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Wheel of Fortune appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The wheel and its inscription: In ancient Egypt, the wheel was a symbol of the sun. The wheel is inscribed with the letters t, a, r, and o, which can be arranged as rota, Latin for wheel. The t, a, r, and o can also be arranged as Tora, the visible letters on the scroll of the High Priestess. See this inscription on card II, The High Priestess.\\n\\n* The wheel\\'s alchemical symbols: The four symbols on the wheel spokes are Mercury, at the top, sulfur on the right, water below, and salt to the left. Mercury, sulfur, and salt were believed to be the secret ingredients used to create the mystical philosopher\\'s stone.\\n\\n* The wheel\\'s Hebrew letters: These form the tetragrammaton: the four letters Y, H, V, H, or Yahweh—the name of God in Judaism.\\n\\n* The sphinx: Meaning unity in diversity, the creature is traditionally composed of a human face (the angel), the body of a lion, the tail of a bull, and the wings of an eagle (the eagle is represented on the sphinx with a sword rather than wings). The four beings the sphinx embodies are illustrated around the Wheel, which also relate to the four fixed zodiac signs (see The Wheel of Fortune\\'s Astrology). See this symbol on card VII, The Chariot.\\n\\n* The snake: According to A. E. Waite, the snake is the legendary serpent-monster Typhon. He appears on the card with his head downward to show the negative aspect of fate. See this symbol on card I, The Magician, and VI, The Lovers.\\n\\n* The god Anubis: Anubis is the jackal-headed Egyptian god of the afterlife and overseer of the rites of mummification. Placed on the lower right-hand side of the wheel with his head upright, we sense he travels all the way around the wheel, through life, death, and rebirth, echoing his role as protector of the dead.\\n\\nThe angel and three animals: The angel, the lion, the bull, and the eagle are the symbols of the four evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—associated with the Four Gospels of the New Testament. They also symbolize the four elements and, by association, the four suits of the minor arcana. See these symbols on card XXI, The World.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL WHEEL OF FORTUNE: THE FOOL AND THE HERMIT\\n\\nThe Wheel of Fortune was a common motif of fickle fate in medieval times. The *Carmina Burana*, a manuscript of 254 poems dating from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, later set to music by Carl Orff, contains an illustration of a wheel almost identical in composition to that shown in the very first tarot cards of the Renaissance era.\\n\\nOn the Visconti-Sforza card\\'s Wheel of Fortune, a regal youth sits on a platform above the wheel. The youth has ass\\'s ears, like early renditions of the Fool (see page 30). A bearded old man—the Hermit—is crouched under the Wheel. As with the *Carmina Burana*\\'s wheel, there is annotation for each of the four figures around the wheel. Words appear on the Visconti-Sforza card that translate as \"I shall reign,\" \"I am reigning,\" \"I have reigned,\" and \"I am without reign.\"\\n\\n# THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Wheel of Fortune in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Six of Swords, for moving on\\n* The Nine of Cups, for a wish come true\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE WHEEL: THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF FORTUNE\\n\\nThis reading uses just the minor arcana cards to reveal how best to harness your potential on four different levels.

A female figure is seated between two pillars on a ceremonial podium. This is the judge, or the virtue Justice personified, holding the traditional symbols of the law—an upright sword in her right hand and the scales in her left. Clad in the red robes of office, her right foot is forward and her pose is alert, as if she is about to pronounce judgment in court. Unlike traditional justice figures, tarot\\'s Justice is not blindfolded. Her vision is clear.\\n\\nThe card favors those who are deserving (shown by the scales of mercy), but seeks retribution for past wrongs (symbolized by the sword of retribution). Justice is delivered through logical procedures and is focused on the mind rather than the emotions—just like the suit of Swords in the minor arcana (see page 176). However, there is, perhaps, more to Justice than meets the eye. Although Justice wears red, symbolizing the material world she lives in, the card\\'s background is yellow, for enlightenment, suggesting the guidance of a higher, divine power. The card design, with a central figure between two pillars, is intentionally similar to those of V, The Hierophant, and II, The High Priestess, suggesting duality and knowledge.\\n\\nJustice is one of the four cardinal, or essential, virtue cards of the tarot. The others are Strength, Temperance, and Prudence. The original Prudence card of early tarots has disappeared, but its meaning may be preserved in Justice. An old interpretation of prudence is wisdom, rather than caution—for example, in the conjunct word jurisprudence, the theory and study of law.\\n\\nThe number of Justice is XI. If XI is expressed as 11, we have two numbers with the same value, symbolizing balance and fairness. II is also the number of the High Priestess, Justice\\'s numerological partner.\\n\\nIn traditional decks of the nineteenth century and earlier, Justice usually swapped places with Strength, number VIII. The VIII also suggests balance, as it comprises two sets of four, which is the number of stability.\\n\\n# JUSTICE\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nJustice takes the sign of Libra the Scales (September 22–October 23), which begins at the autumn equinox when the hours of daylight and darkness are equal, reflected in Libra\\'s symbol, the scales. Justice\\'s element, Air, also reminds us of the scales, which hang midair.\\n\\n# JUSTICE AND KABBALA\\n\\nLamed is the twelfth letter of the Hebrew alphabet and falls halfway within the sequence of twenty-two letters. Lamed means to whip or to goad—to assert authority; its esoteric meaning is fairness. On the Tree of Life, Justice is placed on the thirtieth pathway between the spheres of Tiphareth, for beauty and consciousness, and Geburah, or power. In this way, the card\\'s kabbalistic association suggests power, perfectly wielded.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThere will be a positive outcome. This is a time when past errors or imbalances can be redressed. You benefit from a fair system, provided you are accountable, honest, and deserving. Equally, you may be the judge in your own life, using your perspective and integrity to make good decisions that will safeguard your future. You may take a moral stand on an issue that affects you and those around you. In legal matters, a decision is made or a ruling given, which goes in your favor; justice will be done and order restored. On a spiritual level, Justice shows the working out of karma, or actions and consequences.\\n\\nJustice shows a logical, considered influence. It is a welcome arrival in your reading if life has felt chaotic. It is a card of empowerment, advising you to take a left-brain approach to take control. Influential people favor you now, and your projects get support. Listen to advice from people around you whom you respect. Justice can also indicate the following:\\n\\n* **Home:** Legal issues concerning property are resolved. Contracts are signed and you can make progress.\\n* **Relationships:** While balance and practical issues are important now, take care that your emotional needs are met. Find the right balance between work and relationships.\\n* **Career and money:** At work you may be tested, but the outcome is positive; job interviews and negotiations are successful. Financially, you are coming to the end of a frugal period—money matters are set to improve.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nLife goes out of balance as work relationships and money issues spiral out of  control.\\tA\\tdecision\\tmay\\tgo\\tagainst\\tyou,\\tso\\tthere\\tmay\\tbe\\tdishonesty\\tor\\ta miscarriage\\tof\\tjustice.\\tYou\\tare\\ttreated\\tunfairly,\\twhich\\tis\\tcompounded\\tby\\tbad advice\\tfrom\\ta\\ttrusted\\tindividual.\\tYou\\tare\\tnot\\table\\tto\\tspeak\\tyour\\ttruth\\tand\\tfeel overruled\\tby\\tthose\\twho\\tdon’t\\tunderstand\\tyour\\tpredicament.\\tIt\\tis\\timportant\\tto find\\tyour\\tvoice\\tand\\tstay\\tstrong\\tto\\tyour\\tvalues—if\\tyou\\tare\\tin\\tthe\\tright\\n\\n# HER WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nWith the right values, reward comes.\\n\\n# JUSTICE\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, Justice appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The stone pillars: Boundaries and permanence—Justice\\'s ruling is given within the boundaries of the law.\\nSee this symbol on card II, The High Priestess; V, The Hierophant; and VII, The Chariot.\\n\\n* The sword: The sword shows the action that results from judgment. Like the Ace of Swords, it is held upright (see page 176) and signifies success.\\nSee this symbol on the Suit of Swords; X, The Wheel of Fortune; and I, The Magician.\\n\\n* The scales: The scales represent the thought process involved in making a judgment—in that both sides of a story must be weighed up. The weight in the center of the scales resembles a ring through a sword, an ancient Celtic symbol of justice.\\n\\n* The crown: An authority symbol, Justice\\'s crown is known as a mural crown. Crenelated like castle walls, it suggests that justice is part of a civilized society. The square jewel in its center represents order.\\n\\n* The veil: This appears to be a darkish red on the Rider-Waite card and is often shown as violet in later Rider interpretations. Some say this violet symbolizes spirituality, but consider it first as a soft boundary between the judge\\'s court and the everyday world—when a ruling has been given, the veil is dropped and words become action.\\n\\nSee this symbol on card II, The High Priestess, as a sign of the spirit world beyond her chamber.\\n\\nYellow background: Consciousness, clear sight, and support\\n\\nSee this symbol on I, The Magician; III, The Empress; VII, The Chariot; and VIII, Strength.\\n\\n# HISTORICAL JUSTICE: THE WISDOM OF ASTREA AND MA\\'AT\\n\\nThe figure of justice so familiar to the courthouse derives from the ancient Greek goddess Astrea (the Roman Justitia), daughter of Themis. Both Astea and Themis were personifications of justice in the classical world. In statues depicting them, they raise the scales of justice and point the sword downward, and the goddesses were usually shown without blindfolds. Historically, there are few variations on the card design. The Visconti-Sforza Justice cards, painted in fifteenth-and sixteenth-century Italy, show the likely figure of Maria Bianca Visconti (see page 40) with her scales and upright sword. However, a knight in black armor on a white charger is jumping over the throne, perhaps implying the result or action of her ruling; there may be a resonance with the horseman in the Death card (see page 82). In the Classic Tarot, a reproduction of a Milanese tarot from around 1835, Justice has wings, echoing Ma\\'at, the ancient Egyptian goddess of cosmic wisdom and one of the earliest winged figures we have evidence of in art. Ma\\'at\\'s influence is also suggested in card XX, Judgment. As Ma\\'at weighed the souls of the dead, in Judgment we evaluate our own soul (see page 110).\\n\\n# JUSTICE\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of Justice in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Ace of Swords, for clarity of thought and success\\n* The Two of Swords, which shows two swords, means a stalemate; a pending decision\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH JUSTICE: THE BALANCE OF POWER\\n\\nTake Justice from your deck and lay the card before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose four cards with your left hand and place them around Justice, as shown. You could ask, \"How do I make this decision?\" or, as a prediction, \"Will a decision go in my favor?\"\\n\\nCard 1: Present situation\\nCard 3: The sword: What action to take/what events will occur\\nCard 2: The scales: What needs to be weighed up\\nCard 4: The outcome\\n\\n```\\n   [Justice]\\n   Significator\\n\\n[2]   [1]   [3]\\n      [4]\\n\\n```\\n| Card #  | Position              | Meaning                                                             |\\n| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Justice | **Significator**      | Represents fairness, truth, balance, or legal/spiritual justice     |\\n| 1       | **Present Situation** | The core issue or state of the matter in question                   |\\n| 2       | **The Scales**        | What needs to be weighed or balanced; the two sides of the argument |\\n| 3       | **The Sword**         | The action to take or what events will unfold; truth revealed       |\\n| 4       | **The Outcome**       | The likely result or conclusion if justice is followed              |\\n---\\n\\n\\n# XII THE HANGED MAN\\n\\nAlternative Name: The Traitor\\nNumber: XII\\nNumerology Link: III, The Empress\\nAstrological Sign or Planet: Neptune\\nElement: Water\\nHebrew Letter: Mem\\nSymbol: Water and the oceans\\nMeaning: Transition\\nTree of Life Pathway: Thirteenth, between Hod and Geburah\\nChakra: Third eye, for intuition\\nKey Meanings: Waiting, sacrifice, and enlightenment\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE HANGED MAN\\n\\nThis card, with its strange image of a man suspended from a tree, seems deadly by name. Yet when we examine the man\\'s face, he appears perfectly calm—content, even, regardless of his precarious situation. He hangs by one leg yet his expression is beatific, and he has been given a halo. What exactly is going on?\\n\\nThe Hanged Man is on a tree rather than a hangman\\'s scaffold, and the tree is the Tree of Life, symbol of the world at an esoteric level. This tree is in bud and alive with future possibility. The Hanged Man also appears safely tethered, and it\\'s as if he knows he cannot fall. Suspended in midair, he is content to wait out his fate.\\n\\nThe Hanged Man has numerous possible identities (see The Historical Hanged Man); he may even be Christ himself—we have a halo and a kind of cross, after all. In the Paris Eadwine Psalter, which dates from the twelfth century, Christ is shown upside down on a cross, attended to by angels and two men binding his wrists. This may relate one of the card\\'s meanings, which is sacrifice. The T-shaped cross is also a symbol of salvation and indicated those who suffered through the crucifixion of Christ. It is natural to connect at first with the otherworldly situation of the Hanged Man in his happy suspension, rather than his identity. The Hanged Man is not about to die. Rather, he is hanging around until his circumstances change.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the Hanged Man falls after XI, Justice, and before XIII, Death. We had our values on trial in Justice, and now we must hold on until Death, when we can figuratively let go. Death brings transformation, while the Hanged Man prepares to make the sacrifice Death needs so he can move on. This may sound rather grim, but Death is ongoing change and transformation, and any big shift requires preparation—and in some cases, the waiting time that the Hanged Man represents.\\n\\nThe Hanged Man\\'s number, XII, comprises 1 and 2, adding up to III for the Empress. Both cards are about incubation: The Hanged Man\\'s waiting is a spiritual incubation, relating to the legend of Odin (see The Hanged Man\\'s Symbols), whereas the Empress\\'s equivalent is the gestation time for her babies (see III, The Empress, page 42).\\n\\n# THE HANGED MAN\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nNeptune is the planet of the Hanged Man. Ruler of the oceans, Neptune links with the element of the card, Water. Also associated with mystical states and the  imagination,\\tNeptune\\tindicates\\tthe\\tdifferent\\tfacets\\tof\\tthe\\tcard\\twhen\\treversed— the\\taspect\\tof\\tfantasy\\tand\\tthe\\traised\\tstate\\tof\\tconsciousness\\tthat\\ta\\tperiod\\tof reflection\\tcan\\tbring\\n\\n# THE HANGED MAN AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Hebrew letter of the Hanged Man is Mem, which means the oceans as well as transition. On the Tree of Life, the Hanged Man is placed on the thirteenth pathway between the spheres of Hod and Geburah, or the logical mind versus power. Hod is also concerned with creativity and insight while Geburah has a violent, destructive aspect. The hanged man is suspended between these two energies, and perhaps he must use his clever mind to balance his frustration as he exists in limbo.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe obvious meaning of the card at first glance is hanging around: Events are not moving with speed, but all you can do is wait patiently in the knowledge that the universe has its own plan. The card can also indicate that you may have made sacrifices just now and are eager to see rewards. Unfortunately, you cannot force an outcome that fits with your timetable. There are many other factors about which you can have no knowledge or influence. Therefore, you may also expect delays to travel plans and projects. On a creative level, this card can appear frequently when a person is feeling frustrated with their progress. However, the message of the Hanged Man is incubation—your project needs time to evolve. Use this time to develop perspective on your work and your ambitions.\\n\\nAnother message from the Hanged Man is to try to see things from a new angle. If your approach isn\\'t working, ask yourself if you can think laterally or find a way to turn a situation around.\\n\\nThe Hanged Man can also suggest the following:\\n\\n* **Home:** Waiting and delays may affect remodeling or house moves. Try to invest your time wisely while you wait—there may be a creative solution.\\n* **Relationships:** You are unable to get the commitment you need from a partner, or you may be the one unwilling to commit. Traditionally, it can also show\\thanging\\taround\\tfor\\ta\\tlover\\tto\\tacknowledge\\tyou\\tas\\ta\\tpartner\\trather\\tthan friend.\\tIf\\tyou’re\\twaiting\\ttoo\\tlong,\\tyou\\tmay\\tdecide\\tit’s\\tnot\\tworth\\tthe emotional\\tinvestment.\\n* Career\\tand\\tmoney:\\tHold\\tback\\ton\\tsigning\\tcontracts\\tor\\tdealing\\twith\\tlegal matters\\tjust\\tnow.\\tWith\\twork,\\tdecisions\\tmay\\tbe\\tgoing\\ton\\tthat\\twill\\taffect\\tyour position,\\tbut\\tyou\\tare\\tprotected.\\tIf\\tyou\\tare\\tlooking\\tfor\\twork,\\tthere\\tmay\\tbe delays\\tand\\tfrustration.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nThe Hanged Man reversed can be a sign of rigid thinking and martyrdom. You may need to revise your expectations; what you think you want may not be possible. In the position, the card asks you if you are hanging on to a fantasy that may make you a victim rather than a victor. Take another view and liberate yourself from a contract or other obligation that cannot offer you what you want.\\n\\n# HIS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nUse your time wisely.\\n\\n# THE HANGED MAN\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Hanged Man appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The Tree: This represents the World Tree that the Norse god Odin hung from and the Tree of Life, central motif of the Kabbala, the Judaic mystical belief system.\\n* The Tree as the Tau Cross: Tau is the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet and refers to the shape of a cross, a T-shape, upon which Christ was crucified.\\n* The figure: According to A. E. Waite, the figure\\'s right bent leg suggests part of the shape of the fylfot cross, an early Christian symbol.\\n* The halo: A symbol of enlightenment and a spiritual signifier, around the Hanged Man, the halo is also a symbol of protection.\\n\\nSee this Symbol on card XIV, Temperance, crowning Archangel Michael.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL HANGED MAN: SOLDIER OF FORTUNE\\n\\nThe historical Hanged Man may be Muzio Attendolo Sforza, an Italian condottiere or mercenary connected with the Visconti family, who commissioned the early tarot decks (see page 10). Attendolo killed the tyrant Ottobuono Terzo, an opponent of the Pope, but claimed that Pope John had not paid him for his services, so he defected to fight for King Ladislaus of Naples. According to scholar Geoffrey Trease, the Pope was so incensed by Attendolo\\'s turnabout that he commissioned a satirical illustration showing him as a traitorous hanged man, which the tarot illustration references.\\n\\nAnother possible inspiration for the Hanged Man is the Norse God Odin, who hung from the World Ash tree for nine days and nights and at the end of his ordeal was granted the gift of prophecy. The eighteenth-century occultist Court de Gébelin suggested that the Hanged Man may actually be a printer\\'s error, and that the card was intended to be the other way up. Upright, it resembles a French tarot of around 1720 with a Prudence card showing the Hanged Man\\'s pose, upright with one knee bent. However, given the earliest Hanged Man cards were hand-painted, it\\'s more likely that the figure is correctly positioned—and that the original Hanged Man was actually Muzio Attendolo Sforza.\\n\\n# THE HANGED MAN\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Hanged Man in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Eight of Wands reversed, for delay with moving and communication\\n* The Two of Wands reversed, for delays to plans\\n* The Three of Wands reversed, for delays to travel\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE HANGED MAN: AN ALTERED PERSPECTIVE\\n\\n\\nTake the Hanged Man from your deck and lay him before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose five cards with your left hand and place them as shown. You could ask, \"What am I waiting for?\" or \"What supports me at this time?\"\\n\\n* **Card 1:** Your situation\\n* **Card 2:** What supports you emotionally\\n* **Card 3:** What supports you practically\\n* **Card 4:** An alternative view of the situation\\n* **Card 5:** Outcome\\n\\n```\\n           [5]\\n        (Outcome)\\n\\n[2]   [HANGED MAN]   [3]\\n (Emotional)       (Practical)\\n\\n           [1]\\n       (Your situation)\\n\\n           [4]\\n (Alternative perspective)\\n\\n```\\n| Card #     | Position                    | Meaning                                                               |\\n| ---------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Hanged Man | **Significator**            | The central theme of waiting, letting go, and gaining new insight     |\\n| 1          | **Your Situation**          | The current state you’re in or the issue you’re contemplating         |\\n| 2          | **Emotional Support**       | What emotionally sustains or nourishes you                            |\\n| 3          | **Practical Support**       | External resources, people, or situations that support you materially |\\n| 4          | **Alternative Perspective** | What you’re not seeing yet; a shift in mindset or viewpoint           |\\n| 5          | **Outcome**                 | The likely resolution or lesson once surrender or shift occurs        |\\n----\\n\\n\\n# XIII DEATH\\n\\n!DEATH.\\n\\n**Alternative Names:** Mortality, Transformation, Thirteen; sometimes unnamed\\n**Number:** XIII\\n**Numerology Link:** IV, The Emperor\\n**Astrological Sign or Planet:** Scorpio the Scorpion\\n**Element:** Water\\n**Hebrew Letter:** Nun\\n**Symbol:** The fish\\n**Meaning:** Decline and rebirth\\n**Tree of Life Pathway:** Fourteenth, between Netzach and Tiphareth\\n**Chakra:** Alta Major, for the past and past lives\\n**Key Meanings:** Transformation and change\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING DEATH\\n\\nDeath\\'s image is unmistakable. Unlike the Hanged Man—a common motif in the fifteenth century but a puzzle to us today—Death\\'s grim reaper is eternally understood as an immutable part of our earthly existence. Triumphant with his scythe and hood, sometimes riding a horse, skeletal Death is a reminder of our human frailty. Yet Death is also the bringer of necessary change and is not a sign of the physical death of a person in the present or future. He heralds the end of an era, when what is not needed is taken so the next phase can begin. Without him, we could have no clear sight of what might be possible. Death as the reaper brings in the harvest, which is shown by the five ears of corn on his standard, or flag. Whatever is worth having will be saved, but what is irrelevant will be taken. On the Rider-Waite card, Death\\'s influence affects all people regardless of status, shown by the people on the card at various stages of death or surrender, from the bishop to the child, the king to the maiden. This is the medieval Dance of Death, a common subject in paintings of that era. His black armor and pale horse follow the description of Death, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse described in the New Testament\\'s Book of Revelation.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, Death arrives after card XII, The Hanged Man, a logical progression in that death must be the consequence of hanging, but this is spiritual death and rebirth after a time of contemplation. The card that follows Death is Temperance, when we begin to assimilate our past, present, and future to come to a greater understanding of our potential.\\n\\nDeath\\'s number, XIII, is traditionally unlucky, but in numerology it reduces to 4 (1 + 3 = 4)—or IV, The Emperor, which promises that a new order will come after Death has cleared the way. A sun silhouettes the city: This is both sunset and sunrise, or simultaneous endings and beginnings.\\n\\n# DEATH\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nScorpio is named after the scorpion, which kills with a swift sting—and, unsurprisingly, it is the astrological sign associated with Death. Its dates (October 23-November 22) mark the period after the harvest when leaves fall and we stock up for the winter. Scorpio is associated with death and sex, dying and creation, just as Death brings an ending before fertile new life with the spring.\\n\\n# DEATH AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Hebrew letter associated with Death is Nun, which means fish, a symbol of sexuality and sperm; in climax this is le petit mort, the Little Death, which leads us to Nun\\'s connotations of decline and rebirth. On the Tree of Life, Death is placed on the fourteenth pathway, between the spheres of Netzach and Tiphareth, or the cycles of nature—rebirth and growth.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nDeath brings endings and beginnings—sometimes all at once. This a time of fast and deep transformation and an opportunity to let go of whatever you no longer need. Unlike card XX, Judgment, which signals a process of self-examination, Death\\'s impact is sudden and may be shocking. You have little control over external events when Death looms, but in time you will be able to see this sharp change in circumstances as a blessing. A break with the past—from relationships and friendships to work that is no longer satisfying—is the only way forward. In this sense, Death can be a release and a relief. Death, after all, is the ultimate reality check, and he leaves you with the bare bones, the truth.\\n\\nIn certain areas of life, Death can signify the following:\\n\\n* **Home:** You need to find a new home; the place you are living no longer meets your needs. New circumstances may offer an opportunity to relocate.\\n* **Relationships:** A relationship ends or there is a period of necessary separation. In friendships, there will be an opportunity to reconnect when the time is right.\\n* **Career and money:** Signifying a career change or the ending of business partnerships or ways of bringing in an income, Death also suggests new opportunities are on the horizon. Financially, this is a tough time, but money matters will improve, so hold tight.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nDeath reversed has virtually the same meaning as the card in the upright position, but the difference is in your reaction. You may feel anxious and stressed, unable to comprehend what is happening, rather than being accepting. When Death is reversed, the universe is telling you that there is no way back—a relationship\\tcannot\\tbe\\tmended,\\tor\\tan\\temployer\\twon’t\\tchange\\ttheir\\tmind.\\tIf\\tyou do\\ta\\tsecond\\treading\\tand\\task\\tthe\\tquestion\\tagain,\\tthis\\tcard\\tcan\\tappear\\tafter\\tyou have\\talready\\thad\\tDeath\\tupright,\\tas\\ta\\tfinal\\tconfirmation\\tof\\tyour\\tquestion\\n\\n# ITS WISDOM MESSAGE\\nSwift change brings new beginnings.\\n\\n# DEATH\\'S SYMBOLS\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, Death appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The standard: The standard, or flag, shows a white rose and five ears of corn. The rose symbolizes renewal and the corn, the harvest. Death takes his harvest of souls and leaves the grain—the truth of his decision.\\nSee the flag of St. George on card XX, Judgment.\\n\\n* The black armor: Black symbolizes loss and endings. Death is protected by his armor, whereas his chosen ones have no protection from his scythe.\\n\\n* The pale horse: The pale horse of Death, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, links the Death card with Judgment: The four horsemen bring an apocalypse upon the world before the Last Judgment.\\n\\n* The red feather: Symbolizing the life force, here it is shown wilted and dying. See this symbol as a positive on cards 0, The Fool, and XIX, The Sun.\\n\\n* The bishop and child: The innocent child and godly bishop are both shown in yellow to symbolize their piety. They look directly at the figure of Death, their purity protecting them from fear, while the other victims turn away.\\n\\n* The city gates: Death\\'s rampage takes place outside the city walls because, traditionally, burial grounds were established away from cities for hygiene reasons. On the card, the city gates represent the gates of heaven. The sun rising and/or setting shows the dawn of a new era and the closing of a present era.\\nSee this symbol on card XVIII, The Moon.\\n\\n* The ship: The boat or ship is a signifier in many ancient beliefs for the journey the soul takes to the afterlife. The riverbed is marshlike and suggests the Styx, the mythological Greek river over which the souls of the dead were carried to the underworld; this also links to Death\\'s element of Water. In Christianity, the boat is an old symbol for Christ and the church.\\n\\n# HISTORICAL DEATH: DANSE MACABRE\\n\\nThe Visconti di Modrone tarot (1441–1447) shows Death on horseback with a bandage around his head, wielding a huge scythe—very like our Rider-Waite card, as it too shows a bishop or king and children, all about to succumb. In the Visconti-Sforza tarots, Death is a skeletal archer who holds a vertebra in the shape of an archer\\'s bow. The clear message is that death, just like love, strikes at random. The Black Death, famine, and the Hundred Years War in Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries made death a very common part of life in medieval times, and paintings showing Death were a common reminder of our frailty: Painter and printmaker Pieter Bruegel the Elder\\'s 1562 *The Triumph of Death* depicts a Dance of Death, or Danse Macabre, showing Death as an animated skeleton slaying people from all walks of life, again, like the randomness shown in the Rider-Waite card. Later, Death\\'s dance became a subject for satire, and Death became an almost comic figure, leading unwilling and random citizens to their demise.\\n\\n# DEATH\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Death card in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Ten of Swords, for endings\\n* The Four Aces, for beginnings\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH DEATH: LOOKING AT TRANSFORMATION\\n\\nIf you are uncomfortable with the Death card, focus on the meaning of transition and change—and get comfortable with the image. Take Death from your deck and lay him before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards, and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose two cards with your left hand and place them as shown. You could ask, \"What needs to go?\" or \"What will be transformed?\"\\n\\n* Card 1: Past issues: what is to be released\\n* Card 2: The outcome\\n\\n```\\n[CARD 1]   [DEATH]   [CARD 2]\\n\\n```\\n| Card # | Position            | Meaning                                                    |\\n| ------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Death  | **Significator**    | Central energy of transformation, release, rebirth         |\\n| 1      | **What to Release** | A habit, attachment, situation, or belief that must end    |\\n| 2      | **The Outcome**     | What will emerge or transform once the release is accepted |\\n\\n---\\n\\n# XIV TEMPERANCE\\n\\n!TEMPERANCE.\\n\\nAlternative Name: Art\\nNumber: XIV\\nNumerology Link: V, The Hierophant\\nAstrological Sign or Planet: Sagittarius the Archer\\nElement: Fire\\nHebrew Letter: Samekh\\nSymbol: Support or crutch\\nMeaning: Patience\\nTree of Life Pathway: Fifteenth, between Yesod and Tiphareth\\nChakra: Solar plexus, for personal power\\nKey Meanings: Moderation, reconciliation, healing, and angelic guidance\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING TEMPERANCE\\n\\nAn angel holds two cups flowing with water. He has one foot on a rock and the other in the pool of water, showing the present, conscious mind (the rock, or earth), and the past, emotions and the unconscious mind (water). A clear path runs from the pool through two mountains and toward a potential future: a luminous rising sun. A new horizon or perspective is in sight. The riverbank is lush and verdant, and two yellow irises bloom there, symbols of hope. The angel, by moderating the flow of water in his cups, creates a harmonious flow, a new reality.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the angel of Temperance sits between card XIII, Death, and XV, The Devil; it is the antithesis of Death\\'s loss and the Devil\\'s enslavement to materialism and base urges. The angel is Archangel Michael, the protector warrior-angel, who offers us spiritual help and guidance while we strive to pacify or temper volatile forces. If we look closely, we see that the water from Michael\\'s cups could be running upward or downward. Alchemy is at work, suggesting that a little magic may be needed if we are to reconcile all the demands upon us.\\n\\nTemperance is one of the tarot\\'s four virtues. Numerically between VI, The Lovers, and XX, Judgment, Temperance is also the second angel card in the major arcana sequence; it\\'s a call to spiritual connection and service. This is shown by the symbol of the sun on Archangel Michael\\'s forehead and the amulet on his chest (see Temperance\\'s Symbols). Angels in the tarot are also connected with time. With Temperance, we are dealing with issues of the past, present, and future. With the Lovers, Archangel Raphael calls time on a present decision with future impact; with Judgment, Archangel Gabriel calls time on the past.\\n\\nTemperance\\'s number is XIV, the double of prime number 7, the magical number of creation. In numerology, the sum of XIV (14; 1+4=5) gives 5, or V, The Hierophant. The Hierophant\\'s and Temperance\\'s Archangel Michael is a divine meditator.\\n\\n# TEMPERANCE\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nSagittarius the Archer (November 23–December 21) is Temperance\\'s sign. The archer is sometimes known as the centaur—half-man, half-beast—showing the blending of opposites. The glyph for Sagittarius is the crossed arrow, like that of the archer. It is a symbol of precision, just as Archangel Michael pours the water between\\tgoblets\\tat\\ta\\tprecise\\tangle\\tso\\tno\\tliquid\\tis\\tspilled. Temperance’s\\telement is\\tFire,\\tfor\\taction\\tand\\tenergy\\n\\n# TEMPERANCE AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Hebrew letter associated with Temperance is Samekh, meaning support and patience. Temperance is placed on the Tree of Life on the fifteenth pathway, between the spheres of Yesod and Tiphareth, linking together the qualities of change and salvation.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nTemperance shows you dealing with a potentially volatile situation, and you need to temper your thoughts and actions to find balance and harmony. This means choosing neither one nor the other, but blending two opposing forces to create an inspired solution. The card also asks you not to resist, but to accept both sides of a situation and be guided by what feels most natural to you. It is time to reconcile any area of your life that is out of kilter. Be hands-on; you can analyze what you might do for eons, but what matters now is action.\\n\\nTemperance also shows you are connecting with your guides and angels. You may be given a sign, such as advice from a friend or even a stranger whom the angels have sent to help you. This may also be the beginning of a spiritual journey for you. In your projects, what you imagine you can create. You may also be inspired by an invention or work of art from the past.\\n\\nHere are some other interpretations:\\n\\n* **Home:** Running a household and dealing with demanding children or partners is a fine balancing act, but you have the financial and emotional resources to succeed.\\n* **Relationships:** This is a stage in a relationship when you can reach a new level of trust. If you are single, you may be guided toward a new partner; it\\'s an emotionally intense time.\\n* **Career and money:** You may be dealing with difficult or highly sensitive individuals. Be the diplomat, and you can work a miracle. In money terms, pay extra attention to your income and outgoings.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nTemperance reversed shows imbalance and unfairness in relationships and problems with money; what you pour into your relationships and work isn\\'t rewarded. This card can also show you struggling with change, and the past dominating your present and future. In this position, difficult old memories can resurface and you feel held back. Try to look at what you need now, in the present.\\n\\n# ITS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nYou are guided to find peace.\\n\\n# TEMPERANCE\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, Temperance appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The triangle and square: The triangle within the square denotes the element of Fire (the upward-pointing triangle) and the Earth (the square). This, said A. E. Waite, is the symbol of the septenary—the seven principles of man according to nineteenth-century Theosophists. The seven principles are the physical body, the astral body, the breath, desire, thought, the spirit, and \"I am.\" Above this amulet are the four Hebrew letters Y, H, V, and H, the tetragrammaton for the Lord or, when spoken, Yahweh.\\n* The cups: A cup represents the vessel of our experience. In Temperance, one cup is for the past and one is for the present, and the water running between the two symbolizes the present—what we create from the past and our future expectations. The cups also show focus on the task in hand.\\n* The sun symbol: The dotted circle on the archangel\\'s head is the astrological symbol for the sun and spiritual illumination. It is also the alchemical symbol for gold.\\n\\nSee this symbol on card XIX, The Sun; 0, The Fool; and VI, The Lovers; as a halo, see card XII, The Hanged Man.\\n\\n* Archangel Michael: Archangel Michael is the protector-archangel who deals\\n\\n# with cutting through fear and letting go of the past.\\n\\nSee the Archangels Raphael and Gabriel on card VI, The Lovers, and XX, Judgment.\\n\\n* The irises: The irises refer to Iris, the Greek goddess of rainbows and hope.\\n* The water-pool: The water symbolizes purification and regeneration in cultural practice and is also a signifier of the flow of emotions and unconscious mind.\\n\\nSee this symbol on card XVII, The Star, and XVIII, The Moon.\\n\\n* Rising sun over mountain/volcano: Symbolizing renewal, it\\'s a new dawn after a period of stress, shown by the mountains.\\n\\nSee the sun rising over the city on card XIII, Death.\\n\\n# HISTORICAL TEMPERANCE: FINDING CHARITY\\n\\nTemperance has few variations in its card design throughout history. Early tarot cards of the Renaissance show a woman without wings, and after the 1700s, the woman becomes an angel; the two cups, however, have always been present.\\n\\nIt\\'s likely that Temperance embodies more than just one virtue. Prudence, Faith, Hope, and Charity are the \"lost\" cards of the tarot, which once appeared in variations of the Visconti-Sforza tarots of fifteenth-century Italy as well as earlier tarots. It\\'s likely that Temperance became a natural home for Charity, as the Catholic catechism states, “The virtue of chastity comes under the cardinal virtue of Temperance, which seeks to permeate the passions and appetites of the senses with reason.\"\\n\\n# TEMPERANCE\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of Temperance in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Two of Coins, for weighing up a decision, or money flow\\n* The Six of Cups, for harmony\\n* The Page of Cups, for magical thinking\\n* The Queen of Cups, for nurturing a situation\\n* The Six of Pentacles, for fairness and generosity\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH TEMPERANCE: MAKING PEACE\\n\\nTake Temperance from your deck and lay the card at the top of the spread as shown. Now split the deck into the minor and major arcana and shuffle each pile. Choose the first two cards from the minor arcana pile and lay them out as shown, then choose cards 3, 4, and 5 from the major arcana pile. You could ask, \"What do I need to temper?\" The suit element of the minor cards will show you which life area needs attention. The majors give you a deeper insight into how the situation may be transformed.\\n\\n# Card Reading\\n\\n**Card 1:** What factors are in balance (minor arcana)\\n**Card 2:** What factors are out of balance (minor arcana)\\n**Card 3:** What guidance do I need?

With an inverted pentacle rising from his third eye, he appears to be the epitome of evil, complete with horns, clawed feet, and batlike wings. He is half-man, half-goat, an archetype with roots in many ancient gods. He may be the faun Pan, god of excess; Satan, son of God gone bad; Baphomet, the dark idol the Knights Templar were accused of worshipping; or perhaps Cernunnos, the horned Pagan deity. All are attributed with great virility and sexual power.\\n\\nThe goat-god\\'s abode is black, like a cave. We are in a dark place here, save for his fiery torch. His right hand raised asserts his control over the two small figures that stand before him. The couple is Adam and Eve, who, banished from paradise, find themselves enslaved and corrupted—they are becoming demons, shown by the tiny horns growing from their heads. Yet when we look closely, we can see that the chains around their necks are not at all tight; if they wished, they could walk away from the Devil altogether. The fruit near Eve reminds us of the Garden of Eden and the forbidden fruit. Adam\\'s tail has a devilish fork, showing that these two have certainly given in to temptation.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the Devil falls between XIV, Temperance, and XVI, The Tower. If the lessons of Temperance are not learned, we fall from the grace of Temperance\\'s angel and into the arms of the Devil. When we do finally turn our back on him, the lesson is profound. We must find a whole new way of living as the Tower—the ego—struck by lightning is destroyed.\\n\\nThe Devil\\'s number, XV, reduces to card VI (1 + 5 = 6), or the Lovers. The Devil is the shadow side of the Lovers, fallen to materialism, greed, and lust. The Devil is also a symbol for other negative behavior patterns, such control, dangerous affairs, and addiction.\\n\\n# THE DEVIL\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Devil\\'s zodiac sign is Capricorn the Goat (December 22–January 20), linking with his identities as Pan and Satan. Capricorn\\'s element is Earth, for material needs, and its planet is Saturn. Saturn was the Roman god of time. Time, like the Devil himself, is traditionally the ultimate enemy of man (see The Historical Devil).\\n\\n# THE DEVIL AND KABBALA\\n\\n\\nThe Devil\\'s kabbalistic letter is Ayin, meaning eye, and also clear vision—a clue to be vigilant and all-seeing in the Devil\\'s presence. On the Tree of Life, the card is placed on the sixteenth pathway between the spheres of Hod and Tiphareth. Hod stands for the mind and Tiphareth, beauty and rebirth, which shows us how our insight into a particular situation may just release us from the Devil\\'s grip.\\n\\n## UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nYou may be enslaved to an ideal or a relationship that demands too much. What started positively, or even pleasurably, has reversed, and now you are seeing a situation for what it is. This is a destructive situation, and you may be feeling controlled and under a bad influence. This is a card of greed, temptation, and materialism. Yet to change the situation, you will need to think laterally and use a little cunning. It\\'s never worth confronting the problem, as the negativity is endemic—hence the Devil card often appears to describe situations that are not worth trying to fix or heal. The message is to simply walk away, to escape in the best way you can, regardless of the temptation of staying. The Devil often arrives in a relationship reading to show lust and negative ways of relating, in that one partner is gaining much more that the other. By extension of this, additional meanings of the Devil are addiction—issues with sex, food, substance abuse, and overall negative thinking patterns.\\n\\nSome other specifics include the following:\\n\\n* **Home:** Here, the Devil may indicate living with domineering people or dealing with a difficult landlord. Psychic vampires and generally negative people may drain your energy. You may feel controlled and invaded just now.\\n* **Relationships:** Difficult relationships are indicated here, such as controlling partners, lust-over-love situations, affairs, and codependent patterns. For separated partners, the Devil may show financial dependency or other ongoing money or property issues that keep you tied to the past.\\n* **Career and money:** You\\'re experiencing bad financial contracts, careers that are unsatisfying, domineering bosses, or a toxic work environment—but you stay because you are financially trapped.\\n\\n## REVERSED MEANING\\n\\n\\nWhen reversed, this is one of the few cards whose meaning becomes more hopeful. With the upright Devil, it\\'s time to acknowledge how you may be trapped and to begin to search for the light. When reversed, the Devil suggests the decision you need to make will be easier than you think. When the card is upside down, the chains around the couple are more lax than they appear, so a situation is not quite as drastic as you first thought. Now is the time to make your move.\\n\\nIn terms of health, a difficult cycle is about to end. Addiction and bad habits become easier to manage and eventually banish, and you or those close to you can look forward to recovery.\\n\\n# HIS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nIn one leap, you can be free.\\n\\n# THE DEVIL\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Devil appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The devil: He is a symbol of internal or external oppression. Showing the shadow side of human nature, he suggests base instincts at work rather than the higher self.\\n* The tails: The tails show lower instincts taking shape in our lives. The woman\\'s tail shows fruit, echoing the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden, which she has now eaten. The man\\'s tail is devil-like and appears to be catching the color of the Devil\\'s torch, symbolizing corruption.\\n* The chains: Representing control and dependency, the chains illustrate emotional and material bonds that are habitual but not necessary.\\n* The torch: The torch is not held up to illuminate the scene, or situation; the Devil keeps his knowledge and his power for himself.\\n* The inverted pentagram: The upright pentagram stands for humanity and being humane. When reversed, it is a sign of cruelty and dark forces. The symbol can also be seen as a representation of the Devil\\'s head, with the pointed beard at the lowest point of the pentagram and his ears and horn the middle and upper points.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL DEVIL: DARK ARCHETYPES\\n\\nIn the Visconti-Sforza tarots of the Renaissance, the Devil is a terrifying monster with two heads—one devil, one human—and the Devil\\'s mouth is busy devouring a small naked man. While the man-eating beast was a popular motif in early paintings showing the Last Judgement, myths of devilish gods date back to the Greeks and Romans. The Greek Cronos, god of time, ate his own children. He is associated with aspects of Roman god Saturn, who appears in the fifteenth-century Tarrochi of Mantegna cards as Saturno, a man holding a serpent biting its tail—making the shape of the ouroboros, the alchemical symbol for never-ending time. With his other hand, he is raising a child to his mouth, about to consume it. Four other children await their fate at his feet.\\n\\nIn the mid-fifteenth-century Griggoneur tarots, the Devil is an upright figure with a human body. Goatlike and bearded, with horns and clawed feet, he has a strange devil\\'s face painted on his groin to show the dangers of lust. The devil-in-the-pants motif is also seen in the painting *Devils Waiting for the Last Judgement* (*Livre de la vigne nostre Seigneur*, France 1450–1470). Here, the devil head over the genitals has a big laviscious tongue, making the message of lust and sexual temptation all the more evident.\\n\\nThe Rider-Waite\\'s devil is the traditional Pan or Satan, an embodiment of the Devil archetype across the ages.\\n\\n# THE DEVIL\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Devil in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Two of Swords, for being stuck\\n* The Eight of Swords, for restriction\\n* The Three of Swords, for conflict and betrayal\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE DEVIL: BREAKING THE SPELL\\n\\nTake the Devil card from your deck and lay it before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose four cards with your left hand and place them around the Devil as shown.

A crown, once atop the Tower, is blasted into the darkness as nature asserts her power over Earth. In early French tarots, the card is named la Maison Dieu, the House of God, calling to mind the burning of the Tower of Babel as divine retribution for our sins, a story told in the rabbinic text the Midrash. Genesis offers an alternative story: The Tower and city were abandoned, not burned, when God made the Babylonians speak in incomprehensible languages.\\n\\nAs with the other supposedly dark cards in the major arcana—Death and the Devil—there is always a way forward, provided we can accept a force that is higher than us and adapt to a new way of living and relating to each other. If we\\'ve been cossetting ourselves away in ivory towers, it\\'s time to come back down to earth.\\n\\nThe Tower marks a point of awakening. In the major arcana sequence, it falls after the Devil. If the Devil is pride, ego, and arrogance, then the Tower is a fall from grace. It is a necessary stage of breakdown and rebuilding so our horizons can expand. We must look for a new place to be, physically or spiritually, and engage with new concepts and people if we are to progress to card XVII, The Star, which offers hope and the chance to follow a dream.\\n\\nThe Devil\\'s number, XVI, comprises the mystical number 7 doubled (see VII, The Chariot, page 58). Also, in numerology, XVI reduces to VII (1 + 6 = 7), or the Chariot, which is powered by the charioteer\\'s determination. With the Tower, our willpower has no effect. Only the will of God determines the outcome. In this sense, the Tower, along with the Wheel of Fortune (see page 70), is a card of fate.\\n\\n# THE TOWER\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Tower\\'s planet is Mars, fiery and masculine, forceful and warlike. Although Mars\\'s energy can bring destruction, with this comes a release, a breakthrough.\\n\\n# THE TOWER AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe kabbalistic letter of the Tower is Peh, which means mouth, and also expression, words, and speech, perhaps relating to the Babyloneans\\' speaking in different tongues. Another meaning of Peh is chaos—the impact of the falling Tower.\\n\\nOn the Tree of Life, the Tower is placed on the twenty-seventh pathway between the spheres of Hod and Netzach, or the logical mind and the forces of nature. Whatever we think, we are always subject to higher forces.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Tower hits us with sudden change: the collapse of an ideal, a dream, an organization, or a relationship. This is inevitable and is due to forces beyond your control. The Tower can represent shattered ego, so you may feel vulnerable and confused. Yet you can only surrender to the power of the Tower and work on accepting the huge shift in awareness it offers—although the benefits may not be obvious just yet.\\n\\nThe upside of the Tower is its message of release. The walls come tumbling down, but in the moment of destruction, everything is illuminated. You can see inside the Tower and look at how you built it—how you lived in your psychological tower and what it protected you from. Now, you can experience a flash of deep insight. With the Tower gone, you can begin to sense how the future might evolve. What you build next can have more foundation.\\n\\nSome readers find the Tower an apt descriptor of migraines, with the buildup of pressure and intense pain. The Tower\\'s lightning bolt has also been likened to sexual tension and earth-shattering release.\\n\\nHere are some other possibilities the Tower may signify:\\n\\n* **Home:** The Tower can illustrate an abrupt change to your circumstances. A property you hoped to move into does not materialize, or you encounter delays to building projects, for example.\\n* **Relationships:** A secret comes to light, which may be shocking. It is time to let go of past patterns of relating. Equally, you may experience an intense physical or spiritual attraction, which has a profound impact on your orderly existence.\\n* **Career and money:** Restructuring in businesses, possible redundancies that may mean a move to alternative premises—the Tower signifies change. A person in a position of power makes tough decisions, and a leader may be ousted from their post.\\n\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\nWhen the Tower is reversed, you may find yourself taking responsibility even when you are blameless. It can also show you have held on to a career, project, or relationship that is not strong enough to stand the test of time. If you have clung to the past to protect yourself from reality, your fears may materialize. The Tower\\'s collapse is inevitable, so do not feel responsible for forces outside your control. Its impact is sudden and dramatic, and soon you will know exactly where you stand.\\n\\n# ITS WISDOM MESSAGE\\nSurrender.\\n\\n# THE TOWER\\'S SYMBOLS\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Tower appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The tower: Illustrating society, protection, and the ego, a lone tower can also symbolize the past.\\nSee the symbol of the watchtowers on card XVIII, The Moon.\\n\\n* The falling figures: The figures symbolize humanity at the mercy of God and the power of nature. They also represent the fallout that disaster can bring—emotional, physical, and financial.\\n\\n* Fire: Fire is the element associated with Mars, both the planet and the Roman god of war. It symbolizes change, rebirth, and purification.\\nSee this symbol as a negative aspect in card XV, The Devil, on his torch, and as a positive symbol of growth on card XIX, The Sun.\\n\\n* The golden droplets: On the Rider-Waite card, the flames emit golden droplets in the form of the Hebrew letter J, meaning fire. There are twenty-two, the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet and the number of major arcana cards in a traditional tarot deck.\\nSee this symbol on card XVIII, The Moon.\\n\\n* Lightning bolt: The lightning bolt is a symbol of enlightenment and purification, revealing what has been hidden. In a flash, we are spiritually awakened and cleansed of negative karma.\\n\\nThe falling crown: The crown is a symbol of power and sovereignty. The falling crown shows that worldly power no longer holds—nature is a far greater force. We are not in control or protected by our ego anymore.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL TOWER: PUNISHMENT AND PURIFICATION\\n\\nThroughout the years of tarot history, the Tower has always been burning, although with minor variations. The Visconti-Sforza cards of the Renaissance era show a cross at the bottom of the Tower, a symbol of resurrection after chaos. This may reference attacks on the Catholic faith by heretics, which were common in the fifteenth century. The Tower, a symbol of the power of the Church, is not struck down by God—the flames appear to have been created by the intense heat from two suns, symbols of diverse political forces. On our Rider-Waite card, the burning Tower links with Midrash\\'s account of the fall of the Tower of Babel. It may also be a depiction of God\\'s punishment of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which were burned to the ground in retribution for the people\\'s sins.\\n\\nThe lightning bolt is a magical symbol in many myths and belief systems: A flash of lightning from Zeus impregnated Semele, Princess of Thebes, with her son, Dionysus, the god of wine—thus the lightning bolt is a nod to the shift in consciousness that the Tower brings. Buddhism has its own sacred lightning bolt, a djore (Tibet) or vajra (India), a symbol for the purification of the mind, which, in a flash, releases the negative karma with which we are born.\\n\\n# THE TOWER\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Tower in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Seven of Swords, for loss\\n* The Three of Swords, for sorrow and pain\\n* The Five of Cups, for loss and upset\\n* The Eight of Cups, for emotional upheaval\\n* The Ten of Wands, for overwhelm and burdens\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE TOWER: LETTING GO\\n\\nTake the Tower from your deck and lay it before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose six cards with your left hand and place them around the Tower, as shown.

It is twilight, but we can see clearly a tree and a tiny bird on the right of this serene landscape. At one with the natural world, this woman is a maiden aspect of the earth goddess, or card III, The Empress. Her nakedness under the stars shows purity and truth, and she is connected with the cosmos and the divine. There are eight stars above her, and one of them, a guiding star, is much bigger than the others. The Star card reveals hope and guidance.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the Star comes after XVI, The Tower, and before XVIII, The Moon. After the Tower\\'s destruction, the maiden and her stars are a sign of hope for a new world. The cycles of nature continue, present in the four elements represented on the card: Earth, Air, and Water, with Fire suggested by the yellow guiding star. Pouring calming water onto the earth and into the pool, she heals the past and the present.\\n\\nThe Star\\'s number, XVII, comprises 7 and 1, adding up to 8, or VIII, Strength. Strength shows a clothed woman holding the jaws of a lion, in a bid to control dangerous instincts. In the Star, the maiden has ascended to a more conscious state of awareness. She can let the water flow, trusting that she is on her path. In some decks, this card may show a winged maiden to illustrate angelic guidance.\\n\\n# THE STAR\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Star\\'s sign is Aquarius the Water Carrier (January 21-February 19), and the element of the card is Air. Water represents insight, consciousness, and healing and Air, thought and idealism, suggesting the social conscience with which Aquarians are so often attributed.\\n\\n# THE STAR AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Hebrew letter of the Star is *Tzaddi*, meaning the fishhook; it also takes the meaning of hope. On the Tree of Life, the Star is placed on the eighteenth pathway, between the spheres of Yesod and Netzach. Yesod is the sphere of magic and the moon, while Yesod stands for sensual passion and instinct. The Star is therefore the result of both these aspects, bringing together the qualities of\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Star offers hope and guidance, so if things have felt difficult recently, have faith that your luck is about to change for the better. The Star is a powerful symbol of hope, and you can begin to appreciate everything life has to offer, including better physical and spiritual well-being. The Star supports beauty, and creativity flows like the star-maiden\\'s water. In your projects and relationships, you can be fully expressed, sharing your love, gifts, and talents. The Star allows you to shine and show your Star quality, so your efforts are appreciated. You may also feel more intuitive and insightful under the Star\\'s influence and have more trust in messages from your angels and guides. The Star also shows good health. It is the card of the healer and is traditionally associated with astrology.\\n\\nThe Star can also indicate the following:\\n\\n* **Home:** You feel inspired to create beauty and style in your home, so craft projects and design are especially favored now. If you have your eye on a dream home, it will come to you.\\n* **Relationships:** The Star shows that you are destined to be with someone; it is time to find a soul mate. Other existing relationships are calm and harmonious.\\n* **Career and money:** The Star brings money luck. Work you do begins to pay off, as you have considered your long-term goals and given attention to what matters most. Entrepreneurs may be guided to begin a new business, or you find you have a hidden talent you can put to good use. The Star can also show awards and fame.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nIn the reversed position, the Star can show giving up too easily in your projects and experiencing a creative block. You may be too attached to a fantasy scenario—after all, starlight is bewitching—while overlooking the details. Alternatively, you may feel lulled into a false sense of security in a venture that has no foundation and little chance of success. An additional meaning is feeling alone just now, without the support you need.\\n\\n# ITS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nBe inspired—dreams come true.\\n\\n# THE STAR\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Star appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The eight stars and guiding star: Hope and divine guidance are embodied by the stars. The central yellow star, according to A. E. Waite, is a symbol of Freemasonry called the Flamboyant Star, or Seal of Solomon. (Waite had become a Freemason in 1901.) However, this talisman is usually shown with six rather than eight points, so perhaps this was to be just one aspect of its meaning. The star may also represent Sirius, or Venus (see The Historical Star). The eight stars each have eight points, symbolizing renewal. Eight is also the sum of the Star\\'s number, 17.\\nSee the star crown and canopy of stars on card VII, The Chariot.\\n\\n* The maiden: A symbol of eternal youth and the creative soul, she may be the Greek Aphrodite or the Egyptian deity Isis (see The Historical Star).\\nSee the maiden as a symbol of civilization on card VII, Strength.\\n\\n* The bird: The bird may symbolize the dove of Aphrodite or the ibis of Isis (see History). The ibis may be an intentional link with the card\\'s Hebrew letter Tzaddi, which, according to tarot scholar Jonathan Dee, is \"the perfect fishhook.\" The ibis also links with the Egyptian god Thoth, who was sometimes shown with the head of an ibis, one of his sacred creatures. In general, birds are symbols of freedom and the soul.\\n\\n* Flowing water: This is the water of life, symbolizing resourcefulness and healing. The star-maiden pours water into the pool and onto the earth to nourish it, just as the goddesses Venus and Isis brought fertility to the land.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL STAR: GODDESSES AND ANGELS\\n\\nThe image of the maiden and star has altered little over the centuries, from its simplest form in the Visconti-Sforza tarots—a woman holding a star—to the more illustrative Rider-Waite image, to which is added a pool, tree, and bird.\\n\\nThe star maiden herself may be Greek love and fertility goddess Aphrodite, the Roman Venus, who is often pictured with a dove. If so, the star above her is Venus, the Morning Star. An alternative identity is the Egyptian Isis, queen of magic and fertility, associated with the Ibis bird. If this is so, the big star is her symbol, Sirius, also known as the Star of Isis, fertility omen of the Nile. Legend has it that when Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, appeared, the Nile flooded, watering the crops growing on the silt bed of the delta.\\n\\nIn some decks, the star-maiden is an angel. The card also embodies Faith, one of the “lost” virtue cards of the tarot that existed in early decks. The early Faith cards of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries show a female figure holding in one hand one cup and in the other hand a cross. In this way, perhaps Faith’s cup became subsumed into the two vessels of the Star, and her cross, symbol of religious guidance, went up to the heavens to become one of the eight stars in the sky.\\n\\n# THE STAR\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Star in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\nThe Three of Coins, for creativity The Six of Cups, for harmony The Nine of Cups, for luck and a wish come true Ace of Wands, for creativity and inspiration Six of Wands, for victory and acknowledgment The Ace of Coins, for beginnings and money luck The Nine of Coins, for comfort and contentment\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE STAR: WISH UPON A STAR\\n\\nTake the Star from your deck and lay it before you.

One dog appears domesticated while the other is wild—a wolf, even—representing the dual aspects of internal conflict. The sun-moon above appears to gaze upon the scene below, but the eyes are closed; the solar aspect, the perspective of daylight, is blind under moonlight. The central crayfish appears to struggle halfway between the water toward land. Something very important is about to surface.\\n\\nThe crayfish stands for the fearful self. He can just glimpse the long and winding road that yawns beyond the dogs and the towers. He senses that others have trodden this path before, but can he follow? And if he does, is there reward for taking this risk? Under the light of the sun-moon, what he is seeing may be an illusion, pure fantasy. As A. E. Waite says, “The card represents the life of the imagination apart from the life of the spirit.” This is the dark night of the soul, a lonely time when there is little but moonlight to guide us. We, like the crayfish, will need to make a decision in order to resolve the conflict between staying safe in a place we know and taking on the challenge of the unknown.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, the Moon rises after card XVII, The Star, and before XIX, The Sun. With the Star, we have realized our guidance, the path we must follow, and the Moon shows the hidden impact of this realization, when deep-seated doubts and fears are realized. The Sun is the resolution of this dark night, a sanctuary before we make our final Judgment on our actions before the ending and beginning of our journey with the World. To heal the conflict of the Moon, we need to embody our higher self, our soul wisdom.\\n\\nThe Moon\\'s number, XVIII, or 18, adds up to 9—IX, the number of the Hermit. Both the Moon and the Hermit show being alone and a time for self-reflection.\\n\\n# THE MOON\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe Moon\\'s sign is Pisces, the Fish (February 20–March 20), whose element is emotional Water. In astrology, the Moon in Pisces means compassion and intuition. Pisces the Fish and stands for the soul, as well as sexuality and creativity.\\n\\n# THE MOON AND KABBALA\\n\\n# The Moon\\n\\nThe Hebrew letter of the Moon is Qoph or Kuf, meaning the back of the head and hidden problems. On the Tree of Life, the Moon is on the nineteenth pathway between the spheres of Malkuth and Netzach, or the logical mind and the unseen forces of nature—or what is ruminating under the surface.\\n\\n## UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Moon\\'s traditional meaning is a crisis of faith and a period of emotional vulnerability. It reveals misgivings about a situation, as you cannot be sure if what you are seeing is the truth. Under the light of the Moon, is what you are seeing an illusion? Or does the Moon bring to light the essence of a problem that needs attention? This may be a time of deep emotional conflict, and the struggle is private rather than shared. You have a decision to make, and to choose wisely, you need to rely on your senses rather than logic. Take note of your intuitive messages and dreams now and acknowledge them as valid sources of information that will lead you in the right direction. The Moon can show you being asked to take a risk, to broaden your life experience. The prospect may make you uncomfortable, but the Moon asks you to dive deep and examine the real cause of unrest.\\n\\nThe Moon can also suggest the following:\\n\\n* **Home:** You could be feeling disillusioned about your current living situation or having second thoughts about a move or home improvement project that is proving more costly than anticipated. On a positive note, you may intuitively find an object you thought was lost.\\n* **Relationships:** Confusion and disappointment reign as someone lets you down. A lack of trust that a relationship will work leads you to a love decision.\\n* **Career and money:** You may achieve a goal but ultimately feel it was not worth the effort. With colleagues, emotions run high, and you may need to protect yourself from others\\' negativity. Money matters are stable, but you want more satisfaction from work than just the paycheck.\\n\\n## REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nWhen the Moon is reversed, you may avoid difficult emotions and confrontations, so your needs are not expressed or recognized. A trauma is ignored again rather than explored, so the Moon reversed can show you going back to old ways of coping with the past. The card can also show you feeling stuck in an old emotional pattern that keeps arising—until you give it attention.\\n\\n# ITS WISDOM MESSAGE\\n\\nBe guided by messages from your unconscious.\\n\\n# THE MOON\\'S SYMBOLS\\n\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the Moon appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The crayfish: This creature is a symbol of the primal self, which in this environment is not at peace and is struggling to surface, like subconscious fears.\\n\\n* The wolf and dog: The canines show fear of the unknown. They also are guardians of experience, representing a rite of passage. The wolf is wild instinct and the dog, the tamed self.\\nSee the dog on card 0, The Fool.\\n\\n* The watchtowers or gates: These are the gates of Hades in classical mythology (see The Historical Moon). In a reading, these represent the boundary between the unconscious and conscious self.\\nSee this symbol on card XIII, Death.\\n\\n* The sun-moon: A full moon, crescent moon, and sun are merged. The moon is the subconscious aspect that affects how we behave in the solar world, which dominates the sleeping sun.\\nSee the sun on card XIX, The Sun; VI, The Lovers; and 0, The Fool.\\n\\n* The golden droplets: There are fifteen droplets in the shape of the Hebrew letter J, which means fire. This creates a strong tension with the water below the sun, which in combination symbolize conflict. A. E. Waite calls these droplets \"the dew of thought\" that emanate toward the world of the moon, or intuition and imagination.\\n\\nSee this symbol on card XVI, The Tower.\\n\\nThe path: The unknown—the path is poorly lit and only reflected light may guide us upon it.\\nSee this symbol on card XIV, Temperance.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL MOON: URANIA, DIANA, AND HECATE\\n\\nAs early tarot cards developed, three distinct Moon cards evolved, inspired by lunar goddesses. The Tarocchi of Mantegna has two lunar goddess cards, Luna and Urania. Luna holds a crescent moon while riding her chariot across the skies, while Urania shows a goddess with a blank circle and astronomer\\'s compass. Luna is closely identified with the lunar goddess Diana the huntress (Artemis), often shown in traditional art with a bow and arrow. The Moon card of the Visconti-Sforza tarots shows Luna-Diana: She holds a crescent moon and what appears to be the skein from her bow, loose and useless—a symbol of failure and confusion. The fifteenth-century Griggoneur cards, however, took Urania as their inspiration. Urania, the muse of astronomy, carries a compass and globe in traditional paintings and statuary. On the Griggoneur Moon card, two astrologers stand under a waning moon; one holds his compass up while the other rests his on a book, as if making a calculation.\\n\\nOn the surface, the Rider-Waite card with its strange crayfish has a very different ancestry, dating back to a deck of around 1750 made by Joannes Palegius Mater, and Court de Gébelin\\'s book *Le Monde Primitif* of 1781—yet, like the Moon card itself, a peek beneath the surface shows more than expected. The two towers and dogs are the symbols of Hecate, dark deity of magic—who is a shadow aspect of Luna-Diana. Hecate is the guardian of the gates of Hades, indicated by the card\\'s two towers. The dogs are Hecate\\'s companions—ancient statues of the goddess show her with hounds, and in her form as a triple goddess, she appeared with the head of a dog.\\n\\n# THE MOON\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Moon in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Two of coins, for weighing up your options\\n* The Five of coins, for insecurity The Nine of Swords, for anxiety\\n*  The Seven of Cups, for fantasy and possibility The Three of Swords, for distress—what your heart is telling you The Two of Swords, for indecision\\n\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE MOON: WHAT LIES BENEATH\\n\\n\\nTake the Moon from your deck and lay it before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose four cards with your left hand and place them around the Moon, as shown.

With the Sun, we are seeing the cosmic light. The child on his horse is ready to return home, uniting his spirit with the spirit of the world. He is open-armed and full of joy, and his nakedness shows him as a child of nature. Psychiatrist Carl Jung saw the archetype of the child as an aspect of our developing personality. In this way, the Sun holds echoes of our own childhoods, revealing an opportunity to recapture our early days—an idealized time of innocence and happiness, free for a time from adult, worldly anxieties. In this sense, the Sun is one of the happiest cards of the tarot, offering sanctuary, growth, success, and happiness.\\n\\nThe child is in direct sunlight, in full awareness of himself and his place in the universe. He can see his way ahead—his world so unlike the darker world of the preceding card, the Moon, which can only offer reflected light. In the major arcana sequence, the Sun rises after card XVIII, The Moon, and before card XX, The World. Having faced the fears of the Moon, we, like the child, now see the light of the world and make ready to ride toward it, arriving at card XX, before our reincarnation as 0, The Fool.\\n\\nThe Sun\\'s number, XIX, comprises 1 and 9, adding up to 10, or X for the Wheel of Fortune, which further reduces to I, The Magician. The Sun embodies action and the creative power of the Magician in the earthly realm and the dawning spiritual realization of the Wheel, at which point in our tarot journey we turn toward the higher aspects of life and our spiritual ascension.\\n\\n# THE SUN\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nNaturally, the Sun is the planet of this card. The Sun is concerned with the solar, or outward aspects of the self, and renewed vitality after the dark night of soul encountered under the Moon. In the past, the card has been linked with Gemini the Twins as printed decks such as the Marseilles-style tarots show two children on the card rather than one child, as on the Rider-Waite.\\n\\n# THE SUN AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Hebrew letter of the Sun is Resh, meaning the head and also success. On the Tree of Life, the Sun appears on the twentieth pathway between the spheres of Yesod and Hod. Yesod governs the moon and the unconscious mind, and Hod is the sphere of the rational mind. The Sun integrates these two aspects, suggesting happiness and spiritual growth.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe Sun brings success and achievement and is one of the most positive cards in the major arcana. If you have had a challenging time, the Sun shows that every aspect of your life will improve. You\\'ll also enjoy more energy, and if you or someone close has suffered from health problems, the card predicts recovery and a return to good health. As a card of energy and growth, all your projects benefit now, so the Sun heralds a good time to nurture your creative endeavors, your business, and the relationships you value.\\n\\nThis card is also associated with children and family. It reveals good news about children in general and also about spending happy times with friends who make you smile. You may be reunited with an old friend, partner, or family member. In terms of a state of mind, the Sun shows you feeling carefree and creative, nurturing your inner child.\\n\\nIn a layout with \"negative\" cards, the sun has the power to shed a positive light on the whole reading.\\n\\nHere\\'s some other good news the Sun can predict:\\n\\n* **Home:** You feel comfortable and secure in your home—you may also feel more like entertaining others. In particular, the Sun shows children coming into your home.\\n* **Relationships:** Partnerships bloom under the sun as your relationship grows and you enjoy every minute together. You may also take a trip away to a sunny place to escape everyday pressures.\\n* **Career and money:** The Sun does not specifically predict money but does show success and a position from which you can generate money. The Sun shines on your career, too, as you get the acknowledgment you deserve. Now is the time to bask in your success.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\n\\nIt\\'s virtually impossible to see any negative side to the sun even when reversed.

Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The sun: The sun is a symbol of consciousness, happiness, and self-expression. The solar power of the sun signifies energy and good health. In numerology, the 21 rays of the sun reduce to III, The Empress—perhaps a link to the Empress as the mother of the divine child. See this symbol on XVIIII, The Moon; VI, The Lovers; XIV, Temperance; and 0, The Fool.\\n* The child or children: Simplicity, innocence, purity, and wholeness—These are all elements of the happy inner child. The child appears to have six small flowers in his or her hair in the spirit of celebration.\\n* The sunflowers: Growth, beauty, and strength—The sunflowers grow tall above the level of the wall, reaching upward to see what is beyond the boundaries. The four sunflowers may symbolize the four elements of Air, Water, Fire, and Earth—everything that is needed for life. The sunflower is a symbol of Clytie, a nymph who turns into a sunflower when mourning the loss of her lover, the sun god, Helios (the Greek Apollo). She always faces the sun, hoping to see Apollo\\'s sun-chariot return. The sunflower is also a symbol of the Spiritualist church—as the sunflower when young turns its head to capture the sun throughout the day, so this tells us the search for the light is our true nature.\\n* The walled garden: Boundaries, security, and protection—A. E. Waite calls this \"the walled garden of the sensitive life.\"\\n* The white-gray horse: He represents the vehicle for our soul—the physical body.\\n\\nSee this symbol on card XIII, Death.\\nThe red flag: This illustrates energy and vitality.\\nThe red feather: This familiar image represents the life force. See this symbol on card 0, The Fool; on card XIII, Death, the red feather is withered.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL SUN: SPINNING AND SUNFLOWERS\\n\\nOne of the oldest Sun cards from the Visconti-Sforza tarots shows a male cherub holding aloft a glowing sun-face. The figure has one leg outstretched and the other rests on a deep-blue cloud over a landscape of blue mountains, water, and a grassy plain that ends in a cliff edge. All four traditional elements are present: Water, Earth, Fire (the sun), and Air, represented by the cherub\\'s cloud. The fifteenth-century Griggoneur cards show a version of the Renaissance Moon card (see The Historical Moon in XVIII, The Moon), but his time Artemis-Diana carries an arrow and she is stretching a thread or skein from hand to hand, perhaps part of her bow—or as has been suggested by the tarot scholar Stuart Kaplan, she is spinning yarn. This suggests the Norse deity Frigg, protector of spinning and women, later associated with Artemis. Another interpretation is a connection with the Greek goddesses known as the Fates, who spin the thread of life, measure it, and cut it when life is over: the story of birth, lifetime, and death. Seventeenth-and eighteenth-century cards in the Marseilles style show two children in the garden, rather than one child, with a wall behind them. Flowers begin to appear in the nineteenth century, in the Fanciful Tarot (1852) and the Gaudais deck (c.1860). However, it appears that the Rider-Waite tarot\\'s Sun card was the first to include prominent sunflowers as symbols of strength, light, and energizing solar power.\\n\\n# THE SUN\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the Sun in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Four of Wands, for happiness and freedom\\n* The Ace of Cups, for love and nurturing\\n* The Three of Cups, for celebration\\n* The Six of Wands, for success\\n* The Six of Cups, for harmony and old friends\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE SUN: FOUR WAYS TO SHINE\\n\\nThis reading takes the four elements of the sunflowers to divine your situation in terms of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.

The figures may be holding up their arms to embrace the moment of resurrection before judgment. Judgment is a personal wake-up call to consider our past actions. How do we judge ourselves? The archangel who blows the trumpet is Gabriel, and his wake-up call is a moment of revelation, when we can discover the truth of our relationship with ourselves. We may also be awakened to a new relationship with God, with our spirit guides, or with the angels—as one of the three Angel cards of the tarot, along with the Lovers and Temperance (see pages 54 and 86), Judgment can be a call to spiritual service.\\n\\nIn the major arcana sequence, Judgment comes after card XIX, The Sun, and before card XXI, The World. We have reached a sanctuary with the Sun, a reminder of the paradise of Adam and Eve of the Lovers card, but before we can complete our cycle, we must make some decisions and gain some acceptance about the past. When this is done, we can evolve to a state of completion and rebirth, offered by the World, before we return to card 0, The Fool. When the Last Judgment of man is complete, a new world is created—which the Fool will discover when he incarnates once again and his journey begins anew.\\n\\nJudgment\\'s number, XX, is composed of two tens and implies balancing our past actions. It reduces to the number two, or II in the major arcana cards (10 + 10 = 20; 2 + 0 = 2), the number of The High Priestess, who stands between the earth plane and the world of the dead. Judgment also links with card XI, Justice (whose number, XI, also reduces to II). While Justice is an external judgment upon us, Judgment is how we judge ourselves. At this time, we can reflect on the past, assess our actions, and release the experience so we can move forward.\\n\\n# JUDGMENT\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nJudgment is associated with Pluto, who was the Roman god of the dead and the underworld. The planet Pluto is also associated with transformation at a deep level. The element of Judgment is Fire, perhaps a reference to flames of purification and the burning of the physical body in rituals of cremation.\\n\\n# JUDGMENT AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe kabbalistic number of Judgment is Shin, meaning tooth. The letter takes the form of three upright stokes, like a W, which could be interpreted as the three aspects of consciousness highlighted by Judgment—the past, present, and future. Shin also stands for Shaddai, a name for God. One of the meanings of Shin in the sacred ancient text Sefer Yetzirah is head in the soul, a perfect descriptor for Judgment, as we mentally assess our past actions. Shin also comes up in the phrase Sh\\'at haShin (the Shin Hour), which roughly translates as \"the eleventh hour.\" Judgment certainly tells us that the time is now. On the Tree of Life, Judgment is placed on the twenty-first pathway between the spheres of Malkuth, our perceived world, and Hod, wisdom and the mind—just as Judgment asks us to assess our place in the world according to our deeds.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nIt is time to come to a decision about the past. Great changes and opportunities are on the horizon, but before you can decide on your direction, certain past issues need to be addressed. This process is purely about how you judge yourself on your past actions and attitudes. In the upright position, Judgment shows you will feel you have acted with integrity and did the best you could. As you accept yourself fully, you can blow your own trumpet and praise yourself for your achievements. An additional meaning is being in the public eye, hence Fame, the card\\'s alternative title. Judgment also predicts a spiritual awakening, as you feel called to explore your potential. You have learned much about yourself in this most recent phase and are ready to go further, developing your spiritual connection with your guides and angels. As you receive guidance on your path, your confidence and wisdom will grow.\\n\\nHere\\'s more insight:\\n\\n* **Home:** You may be drawn to an old property or consider returning to a place that holds happy memories. You will soon need to make a major property decision.\\n* **Relationships:** Love is assessed and shifts into a new phase. There may be a need for reconciliation, if you deem the relationship worthwhile. If you are single, you may revisit an old relationship and decide if it is worth trying again. An old friend may reappear.\\n\\n# Career and money\\nAcknowledgment for your successes is coming; finances also improve.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\nWhen reversed, you may be stuck in the past or refuse to learn the lessons that are there for you. You may find yourself in old patterns and not yet able to break free. Delays are also indicated, in terms of future plans, and you may be feeling trapped and unable to progress, without really understanding why. You have the ability to judge your actions and attitudes and then move on; the past cannot be changed, only accepted. Have compassion for the person you were then and for the decisions you made. You don\\'t have to live with the results of these choices in the future; you can decide to be free.\\n\\n# ITS WISDOM MESSAGE\\nLook back with pleasure.\\n\\n# JUDGMENT\\'S SYMBOLS\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, Judgment appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The archangel: Symbolizing awakening, the Archangel is Gabriel, but the flag on his trumpet is that of dragon-slaying St. George, patron saint of England, linked with Archangel Michael. Michael\\'s element is Fire, the element of this card, although what we see on the card is Water, the element of Archangel Gabriel. The archangel, therefore, may be an amalgamation of both Michael and Gabriel.\\nSee archangels Raphael and Michael on card VI, The Lovers, and card XIV, Temperance.\\n\\n* The trumpet: The call of the trumpet tells us it is time to resurrect the past and make a decision. Heralds blew on trumpets to announce war, and also the presence of royalty and other dignitaries, explaining the card\\'s alternative title, Fame.\\n\\nThe dead rising: The rising dead are resurrection and rebirth. The six figures are shown in two groups of three that reflect different phases of the past. They are man, woman, and child, asking us to look at our roles and relationships. Naked, they are about to be reborn. The child symbolizes the spirit of the new age.\\n\\nThe open coffins: Transformation is illustrated by the figures rising from the restriction of their coffins into a new consciousness.\\n\\nThe flag of St. George: The flag bears St. George\\'s cross, for England\\'s patron saint. The red and white symbolize the unification of opposites.\\n\\nThe sea and glaciers: The water is a symbol of purification; the past can be forgiven and washed away. The glaciers feel like a paradise, a new world about to be born.\\n\\n# HISTORICAL JUDGMENT: GOD AND GABRIEL\\n\\nThe oldest tarot decks show one or two angels calling the dead from their graves, usually three people at various stages of emergence. In the Visconti-Sforza tarot held at the Carey Collection at Yale University, we see the walls of a city, showing that the dead exist in another territory. Just discernible is a tiny bridge between the two angels and water running under it, perhaps indicating the river of souls or the Styx, which carried the souls of the dead to the otherworld. In some Renaissance tarots, the angels are replaced by God. In most tarot decks, the dead are naked, as if being reborn, to resurrect the past in order to judge it, release it, and allow ourselves to be complete before we encounter the final card in the major arcana sequence, the World, before beginning our journey again with 0, The Fool.\\n\\n# JUDGMENT\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of Judgment in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Six of Cups, for nostalgia and reunions\\n* The Nine of Cups, for contentment in achievement\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH JUDGMENT: THE SPIRITUAL AUDIT\\n\\nTake Judgment from your deck and lay it before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose five cards with your left hand and place them, as shown. You could ask, \"How do I judge myself?\" or \"What past situation can I let go of?\"\\n\\n* Card 1: Present situation\\n* Card 2: The recent past—what to look at and let\\n\\nCard 3: The distant past—what to look at and let go of\\nCard 4: What may be blocking you\\nCard 5: Outcome: what you can learn from this\\n\\n```\\n           [3]\\n     (The Distant Past)\\n\\n[2]     [Judgment]     [4]\\n(Recent Past)     (Block/Challenge)\\n\\n         [1]\\n  (Present Situation)\\n\\n         [5]\\n (Outcome / Learning)\\n\\n```\\n| Card #   | Position                         | Meaning                                                                  |\\n| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\\n| Judgment | **Significator**                 | Central energy of evaluation, clarity, second chances, and release       |\\n| 1        | **Present Situation**            | Your current position in the journey of reflection and healing           |\\n| 2        | **Recent Past**                  | A recent experience or memory that needs to be acknowledged and released |\\n| 3        | **Distant Past**                 | A deeper-rooted pattern or earlier wound tied to the issue               |\\n| 4        | **What May Be Blocking You**     | Guilt, fear, avoidance, or resistance to transformation                  |\\n| 5        | **Outcome / What You Can Learn** | The insight or freedom gained when you accept and move forward           |\\n\\n---\\n\\n# XXI THE WORLD\\n\\n!THE WORLD.\\n\\nAlternative Name: The Universe\\nNumber: XXI\\nNumerology Link: III, The Empress\\nAstrological Sign or Planet: Saturn\\nElement: Earth\\nHebrew Letter: Tav (Tau)\\nSymbol: The cross\\nMeaning: Completion\\nTree of Life Pathway: Twenty-second, between Yesod and Malkuth\\nChakra: Stellar gateway, the cosmic portal\\nKey Meanings: Completion, success, reward, and joy\\n\\n\\n# UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD\\n\\nOne of the most positive cards of the major arcana, the World signals success and completion. In the center of an oval laurel wreath a figure dances, holding a wand in each hand. Protected by four figures from the Wheel of Fortune, who are symbols of the four evangelists of the gospels, the dancer is also the Fool. From his humble beginnings, he has traveled the world in body and spirit and is about to be reborn in his own card, 0. The dancer is obviously female from the waist up, but it is believed that the swathe of fabric conceals the male genitals of the Fool. This hermaphrodite dancer shows the perfect balancing of opposites, the sun and moon (the two previous cards, XVIII and XIX), our male and female aspects, and the conscious and the unconscious minds. With the world at our feet, we are ascending to higher realms of understanding.\\n\\nA. E. Waite explains in his Pictorial Key to the Tarot how the World \"represents also the perfection and end of the Cosmos, the secret which is within it, the rapture of the universe when it understands itself in God. It is further the state of the soul in the consciousness of Divine Vision, reflected from the self-knowing spirit.\" We can see the World as a card of perfection and of peace. We are dancing all over the world, in harmony within ourselves and with all others.\\n\\nThe Wheel of Fortune as card X and the World as XXI mark two key points in the major arcana journey—the Wheel is halfway, when the Fool turns to the second, cosmic phase of his spiritual quest, while the World is the card of completion and renewal. Before the Wheel and the World are two cards of self-reflection—the Hermit and Judgment (see pages 66 and 110). The World\\'s number, XXI, comprises 2 and 1, adding up to III for Mother Earth, the Empress. This fertility aspect is embedded in the World as the seed of new life and the new tarot cycle.\\n\\n# THE WORLD\\'S ASTROLOGY\\n\\nThe taskmaster planet, Saturn, is the ruler of the World. The planet symbolizes decisions and hard work and shows you deserve all your success. The four evangelists on the card (see The World\\'s Symbols) link with the four elements, the four minor arcana suits of Cups, Wands, Pentacles, and Swords, and the four fixed signs of the zodiac—Aquarius (Air, the angel), Taurus (Earth, the bull), Leo (Fire, the lion), and Scorpio (Water, the eagle).\\n\\n# THE WORLD AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe Hebrew letter of the World is Tav, symbolized by a cross, which can represent the four directions and four elements of Fire, Air, Earth, and Water; the meaning of the character is completion, the card\\'s message. On the Tree of Life, the World is placed on the twenty-second pathway between Yesod and Malkuth. Yesod means change and magic and Mulkuth, the earth itself: in combination, the ongoing cycle of birth, life, and rebirth.\\n\\n# UPRIGHT MEANING\\n\\nThe upright card denotes triumph, completion, and reward for your efforts—and for this reason, the World is one of the most welcome cards in a reading. It denotes deep joy and happiness, and now you can really feel your deserved success. Cherished projects fly, as your commitment and dedication pays off. Life feels balanced, too, as work, relationships, finances, and domestic affairs run smoothly. A phase is coming to an end in a positive way, and you will be acknowledged publicly for what you do. Now is the time to enjoy your fame, and you will have the confidence to take center stage. If you have been waiting for a decision or opportunity to manifest, the World will soon turn in your favor. You may also benefit spiritually just now, living more mindfully and from the heart.  This is also a time for celebration, and in a reading, the World often reveals anniversaries, birthdays, and parties, so it is a great card for groups and positive group consciousness. You may also decide to venture out into the world and travel far afield.\\n\\nThe World could also mean the following:\\n\\n* **Home:** A dream-home come true—whatever you have worked toward can be yours now, whether it\\'s successful building work or other remodeling.\\n* **Relationships:** Happiness and joy—you have a relationship that is fulfilling and loving.\\n* **Career and money:** You\\'re achieving your goals. An award at work, a new position and/or promotion—the World shows you rising in status and being given more authority. You may also receive gifts at this time.\\n\\n# REVERSED MEANING\\nWhen reversed, the World shows you are ready to move on but feel blocked or don\\'t feel you are deserving of success. It can also show hanging on to one ambition that eludes you—and if so, it\\'s time to redefine what you want and adjust your expectations, as you may be clinging on to a dream to the exclusion of all else. Alternatively, you may feel eclipsed by another\\'s shining light. Overall, however, the negatives here are minor, and you will get what you deserve; it may just take a little longer to become obvious. In the meantime, keep the faith.\\n\\n# ITS WISDOM MESSAGE\\nEnjoy your success.\\n\\n# THE WORLD\\'S SYMBOLS\\nIn the Rider-Waite tarot, the World appears with these magical symbols. Some of them reappear in other major arcana cards, so learn to recognize them and you\\'ll soon find you can apply your knowledge throughout the deck.\\n\\n* The angel and three creatures: The angel and the lion, bull, and eagle are the symbols of the four evangelists—respectively Matthew, Mark, Luke and John—associated with the Four Gospels of the New Testament. The animals also link with the four elements and four fixed signs of the zodiac (see The World\\'s Astrology).\\n\\nSee these symbols on card XXI, The Wheel of Fortune.\\n\\n* The laurel garland: The laurel symbolizes victory. It is in the shape of the mandorla, an oval, which signifies heaven on earth and appears in religious icons to frame holy figures.\\n\\nSee this symbol on card III, The Empress, and VII, The Chariot.\\n\\n* The garland\\'s ribbons: The two ribbons are tied at the top and bottom of the garland in a figure-eight, or lemniscate, the symbol for infinity, the never-ending cycles of time and rhythms of nature.\\n\\nSee this symbol on card I, The Magician, and VIII, Strength.\\n\\n* The world dancer: The dancer shows joy and celebration, the animus mundi or \"soul of the world\" (see The Historical World).\\n\\nThe wands: The wands symbolize the perfect balance of opposites: complete self-expression and the ability to make magic happen.\\nSee this symbol on card I, The Magician.\\n\\n# THE HISTORICAL WORLD: THE CITY AND THE WORLD SOUL\\n\\nThere are two distinct styles of World card, one in the Renaissance tradition and the other dating from the 1700s—the latter is the influence for the Rider-Waite World and those of many other contemporary decks. In the Renaissance Visconti-Sforza deck, two male cherubs hold aloft what appears to be a circular painting of an idealized city on an island, showing a twilight sky and stars—perfection on earth and in the heavens above. The composition for A. E. Waite\\'s Rider-Waite card comes from the seventeenth-and eighteenth-century Marseilles-style cards, which show a dancer enclosed in a wreath with the four evangelists in each corner. The world dancer, and the belief that the world herself has a soul, is a part of Hermetic, Platonic, and Shamanic belief systems. What unites both styles of World card is the concept of enclosure, from the idealized city as a circular portrait to the mandorla, or laurel garland, around the world dancer—a symbol of completion and return to the beginning, the cosmic egg that is 0, The Fool.\\n\\n# THE WORLD\\'S REFLECTIONS\\n\\nWe can see aspects of the World in these minor arcana cards:\\n\\n* The Ten of Pentacles, for families coming together in love and financial reward\\n* The ten of Cups, for family love\\n* The Nine of Cups, for a dream come true\\n* The Six of Wands, for victory\\n* The Three of Cups, for friends and celebration\\n* The Six of Cups, for reunion and harmony\\n\\n# TRY A READING WITH THE WORLD: ELEMENTS OF SUCCESS\\n\\nTake the World from your deck and lay it before you. Now shuffle the remaining cards and cut the deck or fan out the cards facedown. Choose five cards with your left hand and place them around the World, as shown. You could ask, \"How will I achieve success?\" or \"What reward is coming my way?\"\\n\\nCard 1: The bull: earth—security and possessions\\nCard 2: The angel: air—thought and decisions\\nCard 3: The eagle: water—emotions\\nCard 4: The lion: fire—desires and goals\\nCard 5: Outcome\\n\\n\\n```\\n       [2]       [3]\\n   (Air)     (Water)\\n    \\U0001fabd        🦅\\n\\n[1]    [World]    [4]\\n(Earth)         (Fire)\\n 🐂               🦁\\n\\n        [5]\\n    (Outcome)\\n\\n```\\n| Card # | Symbol   | Element | Meaning                                                                |\\n| ------ | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| World  | —        | —       | **Significator** — Core energy of achievement, unity, and life mastery |\\n| 1      | 🐂 Bull  | Earth   | Security, foundation, possessions, what grounds your success           |\\n| 2      | \\U0001fabd Angel | Air     | Thoughts, ideas, mental clarity, and strategic decision-making         |\\n| 3      | 🦅 Eagle | Water   | Emotional depth, subconscious influence, spiritual connection          |\\n| 4      | 🦁 Lion  | Fire    | Passion, ambition, motivation, and creative power                      |\\n| 5      | —        | —       | The outcome or synthesis: what your success will look like             |\\n\\n---'),\n",

Anyone can learn to work with tarot and can benefit greatly from its insights; all you need is an open mind and a willingness to trust the impressions you sense during a reading. \\n\\nWe begin with the basics—the structure of a tarot deck, and how the cards link with astrology, Kabbala, and numbers (see pages 10 and 19). Next, you\\'ll learn how to lay out the cards for a reading. You can try the traditional spreads on pages 20-28, and the mini-layouts given for each major arcana card—a total of thirty. The mini-layouts are all original to this book, and I invite you to share them and use them as inspiration for devising your own spreads; the aim is to help you be creative with tarot, to experiment and find ways to read the cards that work for you. There\\'s no right or wrong way to lay out cards just the way that\\'s right for you. \\n\\nThe interpretations chapters follow from page 29 on. To begin with, you might like to use the key words for the card meanings shown on pages 29 and 118 as a quick reference. In the detailed major arcana card interpretations, you will see listed the card\\'s alternative names, number, and numerological association—this is the number that the card\\'s number reduces to, which gives additional insight. For example, XXI, The World, reduces as follows: 2 + 1 = 3, or III, The Empress. Also listed is the card\\'s astrological sign or planet, element, Hebrew letter and Tree of Life pathway, chakra, and key meanings. I also highlight and explain the key symbols of each card, along with each major arcana card\\'s \"Reflection\" in the minor arcana, which guides you toward the minor cards that hold similar meanings to the major card. For example, major card IV, The Emperor, is reflected in the four kings of the minor arcana because as kings they reflect the \"father\" aspect of the Emperor. \\n\\nThe minor arcana interpretations are divided by suit and list for cards Ace through Ten each card\\'s suit, element, astrological association, number, and Tree of Life position and key meaning. Page and Knight court cards list just their element and key meaning, while the Queens and Kings also include zodiac signs and associated chakras. You\\'ll find further information on chakras\\' and crystals\\' association with tarot in the Appendicies, along with a glossary of terms.\\n\\nWhen you are reading your cards, or reading about them, you may be drawn to particular aspects, from astrology to Kabbala or numerology to an individual card\\'s fascinating history or symbols. While all these areas are research subjects in themselves, this book aims to give you a foundation from which to begin; if you\\'re a seasoned reader, my hope is that you will find something in these pages that sparks your imagination and offers a new perspective. \\n\\nHowever you work with this book, I invite you to share with me the journey of tarot and benefit from greater insight into yourself and others.\\n\\n# HOW READING TAROT CAN BENEFIT YOU\\n\\nTarot is a system of archetypes, a picture-book of the human condition, reflecting our states of mind and stages of life. Over the past six hundred years, people have consulted the cards for religious instruction, spiritual insight, self-knowledge, and divining the future. The ancient symbols we see on the cards are designed to stimulate our intuition, connecting us with our higher selves or our divine or spiritual aspect.\\n\\nRegular tarot practice has many personal benefits, including the following:\\n\\n* Increased self-awareness: Tarot gives you space to focus on yourself.\\n* Enhanced creativity: A tarot reading can offer a different perspective on a problem and innovative ways forward.\\n* Better-honed intuition and psychic ability: Tarot helps you see probable future events and influences.\\n* The ability to empower others to find their spiritual path\\n\\n# A NOTE ON THE RIDER-WAITE TAROT\\n\\nMyriad versions and styles of tarot decks have been created through the years. The tarot deck shown throughout this book is the Universal Waite, an enhanced Rider-Waite deck.\\n\\nThe original Rider-Waite was devised by A. E. Waite, one of the key members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (see page 10), and published by Rider, London. It is considered the most influential contemporary deck and has inspired many variants. The deck should properly be known as the Rider-Waite Smith, to honor the illustrator, Pamela Colman Smith, a fellow member of the Golden Dawn.\\n\\n# EARLY CARDS: COURT AND CLERGY\\n\\nThe earliest surviving tarot cards date to the fifteenth century, probably created in Northern Italy. (It\\'s likely that the word tarot derives from tarocchi, an Italian card game that preceded tarot.) These cards, known as the Visconti-Sforza tarots, were commissioned by the Duke of Milan, Franceso Visconti, as early as 1415. Although the Church called early cards \"the devil\\'s picture book\"—possibly because some printed versions were used for gaming purposes—these original, hand-painted cards have predominantly Christian themes and imagery. Their sequence tells a story of a youth who symbolically dies and is reborn, embodied in 0, The Fool, and XXI, The World (see pages 30 and 114; for this reason, the sequence of cards known as the major arcana is often referred to as \"The Fool\\'s Journey\"). The cards feature angels, the four virtues, the Devil, and a male and female Pope, along with other characters we would associate more with fairytales than a satanic manifesto: the wise woman, the mother, father, the innocent youth, old man, lovers, kings, queens, knights, and a magician. Yet knowledge of the tarot may have preceded even the Duke, as in 1377 a German monk, brother Johannes von Rheinfield, described a series of painted cards that worked as an allegorical journey of life and the soul. It\\'s also believed that gnostic sects may have used the cards to teach illiterate people about dualism, or the interplay of opposites—which we see in many of the card\\'s meanings. In this way, the cards may have been used to express and possibly teach Christian beliefs.\\n\\n# HIDDEN KNOWLEDGE: ASTROLOGY AND KABBALA\\n\\nThe word occult may have dark connotations, but it actually means hidden knowledge. The tarot\\'s reputation as an occult practice crept in during the eighteenth century, with the French Freemason Antoine Court de Gébelin\\'s treatise *Monde Primitif* (1781) in which he claimed tarot cards were in effect an ancient Egyptian book of wisdom; he named the tarot *The Book of Thoth*, after the Egyptian god of healing, wisdom, and the occult. De Gébelin\\'s beliefs emerged as a part of the occult revival of the late 1800s, when ancient knowledge was popularized by Napoleon\\'s invasion of Egypt in 1798 and tomb artifacts made their way to the West. De Gébelin\\'s work was continued by a Parisian barber, Jean-Baptiste Alliette (know by his pseudonym Etteilla), who developed the tarot\\'s possible links with Kabbala, the esoteric belief system based in Hebrew tradition. The story continues with the French Rosicrucian Eliphas Levi, who made the connection between the twenty-two cards of the major arcana and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which correspond to pathways on the Tree of Life.\\n\\nLevi\\'s research influenced A. E. Waite, the creator of the Rider-Waite cards, who was a leading light of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a British occult society founded in 1888 by freemasons William Wynn Westcott, William Robert Woodman, and Samuel Liddell Mathers. The order brought together kabbalistic, astrological, and Egyptian wisdom, creating a theory of tarot associations that have become generally accepted today (see the Appendicies for a list of these associations for the major and minor arcanas).\\n\\nWhile tarot has collected many occult associations over the years, essentially, these magical cards reflect the beliefs of their creators. Tarot\\'s ability to adapt and survive has lead to a plethora of decks, from Wiccan tarots to Steampunk, angel tarots to vampires, and fairies to Da Vinci. While these may be contemporary tastes, tarot ultimately speaks to us through its archetypes, the infinite mirrors of the self.\\n\\n# EXPLORING THE DECK: THE MAJOR AND MINOR ARCANA\\n\\nA standard tarot deck has seventy-eight cards, divided into two groups: twenty-two major arcana cards and fifty-six minor arcana cards. The word arcana means secret. The major arcana denote important life events or shifts, while the minor arcana cards reflect day-to-day events. The minor arcana cards can be seen as being more detailed aspects of the major arcana cards.\\n\\n## The Major Arcana Cards\\n\\nNumbered from 0 (The Fool) to XXI (The World), the twenty-two major arcana cards can be referred to singularly as arcanum and collectively as keys or trumps. Although no one knows the provenance of the tarot\\'s major arcana cards for sure, some suspect the word trump derives from triumphs, from the old card game Trionfi, popular initially in Italy and France. In the game, trump cards approximating the major arcana outranked other cards in the deck. For example, the Fool is trumped by the clever Magician, who is trumped by the wisdom of the High Priestess. Well-known librarian Gertrude Moakley also suggested that the major arcana characters and symbols derived from a Milanese carnival based on the Roman festival of Saturnalia: Cityfolk dressed as tarot trumps and processed in chariots throughout the city. As the Duke of Milan is believed to have commissioned some of the first tarot cards in the fifteenth century (the Visconti-Sforza tarots, some of which survive today), the festival explanation may be plausible.\\n\\n# The Minor Arcana Cards\\n\\nThe remaining fifty-six cards are known collectively as the minor arcana, and they are arranged into four suits: Wands, Pentacles, Cups, and Swords. Each suit has fourteen cards, from Ace to Ten, plus four court cards: Page, Knight, Queen, and King.\\n\\nThe four suits each have a ruling element, and each corresponds to specific areas of life:\\n\\n* Cups: the element of Water; emotions and relationships\\n* Pentacles: the element of Earth; property, money, and achievement ⚙️Swords: the element of Air; the intellect and decisions ⚙️Wands: the element of Fire; instinct, travel, and communication Psychologist Carl Jung famously distilled humankind\\'s mental processes into his theory of four functions, and it sums up the suit meanings neatly: ⚙️Swords/Air: I think\\n\\n⚙️Wands/Fire: I desire\\n\\n⚙️Pentacles/Earth: I possess ⚙️Cups/Water: I feel\\n\\nAnother way of remembering the suits’ elements is as follows:\\n\\n⚙️Swords/Air: I think—the mind ⚙️Wands/Fire: I desire—the soul\\n\\n⚙️Pentacles/Earth: I possess—the body ⚙️Cups/Water: I feel—the heart The court, or people, cards of the minor arcana bring an additional element:\\n\\n⚙️Knights: Fire\\n\\n⚙️Queens: Water\\n\\n⚙️Kings: Air\\n\\n⚙️Pages: Earth\\n\\nSo, for example, the Knight of Wands is Fire of the suit of Fire, while the Queen of Wands is Water of the suit of Fire. Understanding the basic concepts of the elements offers a meaning for the card. So, the Queen of Wands, combining Water and Fire, suggests emotions and intuition (Water) with communication and energy (Fire).\\n\\nACE of WANDS\\nII\\nIII\\nIV\\nV\\nVI\\nVII\\nVIII\\nIX\\nX\\nPAGE of WANDS\\nKNIGHT of WANDS\\nQUEEN of WANDS\\nKING of WANDS\\n\\n# Tarot Cards\\n\\n| ACE & CUPS | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| IX | X | PAGE & CUPS | KNIGHT & CUPS | QUEEN & CUPS | KING & CUPS |  |  |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| ACE & SWORDS | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| IX | X | PAGE & SWORDS | KNIGHT & SWORDS | QUEEN & SWORDS | KING & SWORDS |  |  |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| ACE & PENTACLES | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| IX | X | PAGE & PENTACLES | KNIGHT & PENTACLES | QUEEN & PENTACLES | KING & PENTACLES |  |  |\\n\\n\\n'),\n",
